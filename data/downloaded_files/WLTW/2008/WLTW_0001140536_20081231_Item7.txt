Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of SEC rules. We present such non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.  

This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the heading "Summary2008 Expense Review," "Market outlook" and "Financial Targets". Please see "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.  

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND MARKET OUTLOOK   

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients. Our core businesses include Aerospace; Energy; Marine; Construction; Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance.  

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.  

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Commission levels generally trend with such premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Due to the cyclical nature and impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, they may vary widely between accounting periods. Such variations can result in a reduction in premium rates leading to downward pressure on commission revenues (a "soft" market) which in turn can have a   

potentially material impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.  

A "hard" market occurs when premium uplifting factors, including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital shortages, more than offset any downward pressures on premiums. This usually has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.  

From 2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a hard market to a soft market, with premium rates falling in most markets. The soft market continued through 2005 and 2006 with rates declining in most sectors, with the exception of catastrophe exposed markets.  

In 2007, the market softened further and this has continued through 2008 with year on year premium rate decreases averaging approximately 10 percent across our market sectors during 2008.  

It is possible that the market may harden in 2009 as insurers seek higher premiums to cover a combination of weak investment returns, significant losses in 2008 and three years of soft market underwriting. In the reinsurance market, we have seen stabilization in rates and early signs of market recovery going into 2009.  

However, these potential benefits may be offset in whole or in part by potential changes in the   

31 

buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from the current global market uncertainty. In particular, financial institutions, construction, aviation, and logistics businesses such as marine cargo are most likely to be affected. Further, the global economic activity is   

also negatively affecting some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our International operations. Our employee benefits practice may also be adversely affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period of economic turmoil.   

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   

 Overview  

Despite the difficult trading conditions in 2008, we reported 4 percent organic commissions and fee growth in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting growth in our International and Global Specialties operations, partly offset by a 1 percent fall in North America organic commissions and fees.  

Operating margin for full year 2008 was 18 percent compared with 24 percent for 2007, of which 4 percentage points were attributable to charges relating to our 2008 expense review and 2 percentage points were attributable to the impact of foreign exchange movements.  

In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, the eighth largest insurance and risk intermediary in the United States. The acquisition doubled our North America revenues and the combined Willis HRH operation has critical mass in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia.  

 Results 2008 compared with 2007  

Net income in 2008 was $303 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, compared with $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, in 2007. The benefits of good organic revenue growth, improved margins in our International and Global operations and a lower effective tax rate were more than offset by a $0.45 per diluted share impact of charges for the 2008 expense review and a $0.27 per diluted share year on year impact from foreign exchange, discussed in detail within "General and administrative expenses" below.  

HRH's fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs and intangible amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted share. New shares   

issued as part consideration for the HRH acquisition had an $0.11 dilutive impact on full year diluted earnings per share.  

Total revenues at $2,834 million were $256 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent, a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals primarily reflecting the HRH acquisition and a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency translation were partly offset by lower investment and other income. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net new business growth of 6 percent and a 2 percent negative impact from declining rates and other market factors. Net new business growth benefitted from a 1 percentage point improvement in client retention rate to 91 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2007.  

Operating margin at 18 percent in 2008 was 6 percentage points lower than in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting:   

the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points;   

an adverse year on year impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 2 percentage points;   

a $22 million increase in intangibles amortization, of which $21 million related to HRH;   

our continued investment in targeted new hires and Shaping our Future initiatives; and   

lower investment and other income;   

partly offset by    

increased productivity, with revenues per full time equivalent ("FTE") employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;   

32 

HRH's $38 million operating income in fourth quarter 2008, equivalent to 1 percentage point; and   

good cost control, the realization of savings from last year's Shaping our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.  

A combination of factors, including a reduction in the UK corporate tax rate and a change in our geographical mix of income, enabled us to reduce our effective underlying tax rate to 26 percent in 2008 compared with 30 percent in 2007. This underlying rate excludes the tax effects of the disposal of our London headquarters, gains and losses on disposal of operations and the benefit of the release of tax provisions relating to the resolution of prior period tax positions.  

 Results 2007 compared with 2006  

Net income in 2007 was $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, compared with $449 million, or $2.84 per diluted share, in 2006 as the benefits of increased revenues and a 1 percent increase in margin were more than offset by the non-recurrence of a $71 million tax credit in fourth quarter 2006, primarily relating to the resolution of certain prior year tax matters.  

Total revenues at $2,578 million were $150 million, or 6 percent, higher than in 2006 of which 2 percent related to foreign currency translation and 1 percent to net acquisitions and disposals. Organic revenue growth was 3 percent reflecting net new business growth of 4 percent and a 1 percent negative impact from declining rates and other market factors.  

Operating margin at 24 percent was 1 percentage point higher than in 2006 mainly reflecting:   

the $102 million gain on disposal of our London headquarters in 2006, equivalent to approximately a 4 percentage point decrease in margin;   

the $105 million expenditure in 2006 to launch our Shaping our Future strategy, equivalent to approximately a 4 percentage point increase in margin;   

the benefit of 2007 cost savings relating to our Shaping our Future strategy and lower charges for pensions and legal provisions; and   

an adverse year on year impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately a 1 percentage point decrease in margin.  

 HRH acquisition  

On October 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States.  

We believe that the acquisition of HRH will:   

substantially improve our position in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia;   

greatly strengthen our position as a middle market broker and reinforce our large account presence; and   

enable the combined Willis HRH operation to deliver enhanced value to clients through a more robust and diversified platform.  

We also expect to achieve significant synergies by 2010 of approximately $140 million as we centralize HRH's dispersed back office processes and integrate these into Willis hubs, rationalize the combined office network and close down HRH's Richmond head office.  

Assuming the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2007, pro forma combined revenues for the Group for full year 2008 would have been $3,451 million (2007: $3,378 million), of which $1,546 million, or 45 percent (2007: $1,586 million, or 47 percent), would be attributable to North America operations.  

Total consideration paid by Willis for HRH was approximately $1.8 billion, which comprised approximately 24.4 million shares of common stock valued at $792 million and $982 million of cash. The total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion included the assumption of approximately $340 million of HRH existing debt. The funding of the HRH transaction is discussed in "Cash and financing" below.   

33 

On acquisition we recognized an intangible asset of $639 million comprising:    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Customer relationships were identified as the key intangible asset as HRH has historically generated approximately 95 percent of its revenues from existing customers. The charge for HRH's intangible amortization was $21 million in fourth quarter 2008; we expect the full year 2009 charge relating to HRH's intangibles to be $82 million.  

We recognized goodwill on the acquisition of $1.6 billion. However, we are still in the process of finalizing the valuation of certain assets and liabilities, thus the purchase price allocation is still subject to refinement.  

HRH is being rapidly integrated into our North America segment. We complete our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter. Based on our forecasts of the combined Willis HRH's future revenue streams and anticipated synergies from the deal, we believe the combined goodwill for North America of $1,810 million was not impaired as of December 31, 2008. However, if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from the HRH transaction, goodwill may be impaired in future periods.  

 Other acquisitions  

Additionally in 2008, we acquired a further 10 percent of voting rights in Gras Savoye & Cie, our French associate at a cost of approximately $70 million, bringing our ownership share of voting rights to approximately 48 percent as at December 31, 2008.   

 2008 expense review  

Our Shaping our Future strategy is a series of initiatives designed to deliver profitable growth. As previously announced, we decided:   

to invest in further key hires and initiatives in 2008 and 2009;  

and, in order to fund a portion of these initiatives,   

to conduct a thorough review in 2008 of all businesses to identify additional opportunities to rationalize our expense base.  

In 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $92 million ($66 million net of tax, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share) comprising:   

$42 million to buy out remuneration packages that no longer align with the Group's overall remuneration strategy;   

$24 million of severance costs relating to approximately 350 positions which have been eliminated; and   

$26 million of other operating expenses, including property and systems rationalization costs.  

In light of the current global economic uncertainty, we are vigorously reviewing our cost base and will continue our right-sizing initiatives in 2009. Our current right-sizing initiatives emphasize cost discipline including talent management, location optimization and aggressive reduction of discretionary spending. We now expect that the 2008 charges above, together with the benefits of the ongoing review, may lead to 2009 cost savings in excess of the $45 million to $55 million originally estimated.  

 Financial targets  

In light of the current uncertainty in the global economy, we have suspended our practice of providing annual earnings guidance for the year ahead, as we cannot predict the potential impact of this uncertainty on insurance pricing or on potential changes in the buying decisions of clients with any degree of certainty.  

In addition, our previously stated earnings per share targets should not be relied upon.   

34 

 Cash and financing  

Cash at December 31, 2008 was $176 million; $24 million lower than at December 31, 2007.  

Net cash from operating activities of $211 million and net proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt totaling $1,669 million, together with a net $30 million benefit from other smaller cash flows less the impact of foreign exchange, were used to fund:   

acquisitions of $978 million, of which $926 million related to HRH;   

repayments of outstanding debt of $641 million, of which $341 million related to HRH debt assumed on the acquisition;   

dividend payments of $146 million;   

fixed asset additions of $94 million, of which $38 million related to our new London headquarters building; and   

share buybacks of $75 million.  

Total long-term debt at December 31, 2008 was $1,865 million (December 31, 2007: $1,250 million), total short-term debt was $785 million (December 31, 2007: nil) and total stockholders' equity was $1,845 million (December 31, 2007: $1,347 million) giving a capitalization ratio (total long-term and short-term debt to total long-term debt, short-term debt and stockholders' equity) of 59 percent at December 31, 2008 compared with 48 percent at December 31, 2007. The 11 percent increase in the capitalization ratio is mainly attributable to debt drawn down as part of the HRH acquisition, partly offset by the $792 million equity issued to fund the remainder of the transaction.  

On October 1, 2008, we funded the HRH acquisition with $1 billion from an interim credit facility and $525 million from a $700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility and replaced this with a new 5-year $300 million line of credit.  

During fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the then outstanding $1 billion balance on the interim credit facility funded by   

using free cash flow (cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding acquisitions, disposals and additional pension contributions) of $75 million together with the draw down of the remaining $175 million available under the 5-year term loan facility.  

In February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during March 2009. The net proceeds of the issue will be used to repay approximately $480 million of the interim credit facility. We expect to be able to repay the approximately $270 million remaining balance on this short-term facility over the next two quarters from free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses.  

Over time, following full repayment of the interim credit facility, and subject to limitations in our debt facilities, we also plan to repurchase the majority of the shares issued in connection with the acquisition of HRH under our existing $1 billion buyback authorization.  

 Liquidity  

We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 of $176 million, the consummation of the agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue $500 million of senior unsecured notes, availability under our $300 million revolving credit facility together with future generation of free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses should be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance full repayment of the $750 million outstanding balance on our interim credit facility, current portions of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and presently known operating needs.  

Long-term liquidity for debt service and other contractual obligations will be dependent on continued generation of free cash flow and,   

35 

given favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancing. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as various uncertainties discussed in this section and elsewhere in this document, which could require us to pursue other financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancing, asset sales or other financing alternatives. With the current tightening in the credit markets, the amount and terms, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured.  

We continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. These actions include the rationalization of our cost base through the 2008 expense review and our ongoing right-sizing initiatives to achieve best fit within the current environment.  

 Share buybacks  

On November 1, 2007, the Board authorized a new share buyback program for $1 billion. This replaced our previous $1 billion buyback program and its remaining $308 million   

authorization. In addition the board authorized in June 2008, the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of HRH.  

In first quarter 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $75 million under the new authorization of which $925 million is outstanding.  

 London headquarters  

We completed the move from Ten Trinity Square into our new London headquarters on Lime Street in April 2008. We entered into an agreement to lease the Lime Street building in November 2004, and took control of the building in June 2007, under a 25 year lease. Annual rentals are approximately $35 million per year and we have subleased or agreed to sublease approximately 30 percent of the site under leases with terms up to 15 years. The outstanding contractual obligation for lease rentals at December 31, 2008 was $720 million and the amounts receivable from committed subleases were $106 million.   

 OPERATING RESULTSGROUP  

 Revenues  

 2008 compared with 2007   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 

(ii)Effective October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.  

36 

Our 2008 total revenues at $2,834 million were $256 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007, reflecting a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals principally attributable to HRH, organic commissions and fee growth of 4 percent and a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower investment and other income.  

Our International and Global operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2008, reported revenues in International benefited from the year on year weakening of the US dollar against the euro, compared with 2007. However, in our Global operations the revenue line benefit of the stronger euro was offset by sterling weakening against the US dollar, compared with 2007.  

Investment income was $81 million for 2008, $15 million lower than in 2007, with the decrease reflecting lower average interest rates in 2008. We expect investment income to decrease by approximately $20 million in 2009 compared with 2008 as interest rates have continued to experience sharp declines across the globe. This estimated decrease includes the mitigating effect of our forward hedging program, from which we expect to generate significant savings compared to LIBOR based rates.  

Other income was $2 million for 2008, $17 million lower than in 2007 which benefited   

from a higher than usual level of proceeds from the sale of books of business.  

Organic growth in commissions and fees in 2008 was 4 percent compared with 2007, reflecting   

net new business growth of 6 percent which comprised good growth in our International and Global Specialties businesses offset by lower revenues in North America and Reinsurance. Net new business growth also included the benefit of our Shaping our Future growth initiatives and a 1 percentage point improvement in client retention rates to 91 percent for 2008 compared with 90 percent for 2007;  

partly offset by   

a negative 2 percent impact from premium rates and other market factors in 2008. The impact of significant rate decreases in both periods has been tempered by the benefit of other market factors, including higher commission rates, client profitability analyses, higher insured values and changes in limits or exposures.  

Organic revenue growth by segment is discussed further in "Operating ResultsSegment Information" below.   

37 

 2007 compared with 2006   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 

(ii)Effective October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.   

Our 2007 total revenues of $2,578 million were $150 million, or 6 percent, higher than in 2006 of which 2 percent was attributable to foreign currency translation and 1 percent to net acquisitions and disposals.  

For the year ended December 31, 2007, reported revenues in International benefited significantly from the year on year effect of foreign currency translation, in particular due to the weakening of the dollar against both sterling and the euro, compared with 2006.  

Net acquisitions and disposals added a net 1 percent to total revenues in 2007 which was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of: InsuranceNoodle in Chicago; Burkart Risk Consulting and Partner in Switzerland; and Gras Savoye Re, a new venture with Gras Savoye & Cie.   

Organic growth in commissions and fees in 2007 was 3 percent compared with 2006, reflecting   

net new business growth of 4 percent, together with the benefit of maintaining client retention levels in excess of 90 percent;  

partly offset by   

a negative 1 percent impact from premium rates and other market factors, with the impact of the significant rate decreases largely offset by the benefit of other market factors, including higher commission rates, client profitability analyses, higher insured values and changes in limits or exposures.  

Organic revenue growth by segment is discussed further in "Operating ResultsSegment Information" below.   

 General and administrative expenses   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

38 

 2008 compared with 2007  

General and administrative expenses at $2,247 million for 2008 were $339 million, or 18 percent, higher than in 2007 of which:   

$141 million, or 7 percentage points, was attributable to the fourth quarter acquisition of HRH;   

$92 million, or 5 percentage points, was attributable to the charge for the 2008 expense review discussed above, of which $66 million related to salaries and benefits and $26 million to other expenses; and   

a foreign exchange loss of $68 million, or 4 percentage points, including $34 million related to the revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset as discussed below together with $23 million relating to pound sterling purchases to fund the Company's contributions to the plan.  

Salaries and benefits were 58 percent of 2008 revenues, compared with 56 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:   

the $66 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review; and   

continued hiring in targeted development areas including selected US regions; targeted International growth areas such as Spain, Italy, Denmark and Brazil; and a number of our London specialty businesses;  

partly offset by   

increased productivity: average revenues per FTE employee at constant exchange rates were approximately $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;   

the benefits of cost controls and previous Shaping our Future initiatives; and   

a $15 million reduction in pension charges. This decrease was mainly attributable to an increase in the expected return on assets in the UK pension plan reflecting higher opening asset levels due to the significant additional contributions we have made.  

Net headcount on an FTE basis at December 31, 2008 was approximately 17,000 compared with approximately 13,000 at December 31, 2007, with the increase primarily reflecting the acquisition of HRH. The increase in average revenues per FTE employee discussed above reflected growth   

across all business units, particularly driven by our International business which has continued its record of outstanding growth.  

Other expenses were 21 percent of revenues in 2008 compared with 18 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:   

$33 million additional other expenses in fourth quarter 2008 as a result of the HRH acquisition, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point;   

the $26 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point; and   

a $34 million foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset. This asset is a sterling denominated asset but a portion of the asset is held within our UK London market operations, which are US dollar denominated for accounting purposes. As the dollar strengthened significantly against sterling in 2008, the revaluation of the sterling pension benefits asset gave rise to a foreign exchange loss.  

We have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from our London market operations, as part of which we hedge the sterling denominated cash contributions into the UK pension plan. However, we do not hedge against the pension benefits asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes.  

The effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the benefits of our continued focus on cost controls.  

 2007 compared with 2006  

General and administrative expenses at $1,908 million for 2007 were $3 million lower than in 2006. This decrease was mainly attributable to:   

the 2006 strategic initiative expenditure of $96 million relating to the launch of our Shaping our Future strategy, of which $59 million related to salaries and benefits and $37 million to other expenses; and   

the benefits of our Shaping our Future initiatives;   

39 

partly offset by   

a 4 percent adverse impact from foreign currency translation.  

Salaries and benefits were 56 percent of 2007 revenues, compared with 60 percent in 2006, with the decrease reflecting:   

the $59 million benefit as a result of 2006 strategic initiative expenditure, equivalent to approximately 2 percentage points;   

the benefits of cost controls and our Shaping our Future initiatives; and   

a $36 million reduction in pension charges, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point. This decrease was mainly attributable to an increase in the expected return on assets in the UK plan reflecting higher asset levels due to the significant additional contributions we have made in 2007 and 2006;  

partly offset by   

an adverse impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 4 percentage points; and   

continued hiring in targeted development areas, including energy, construction, marine, financial institutions, reinsurance analytics and employee benefits.  

Other expenses were 18 percent of revenues in 2007 compared with 19 percent in 2006, with the decrease reflecting:   

the $37 million benefit as a result of 2006 strategic initiative expenditure, equivalent to approximately 2 percentage points;   

a $22 million reduction in the net charge for legal provisions, reflecting both the favorable resolution of a small number of potentially significant claims and the benefit of a favorable trend in UK claims expense; and   

the benefit of our continued focus on cost controls;  

partly offset by   

an adverse impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 4 percentage points; and   

a $17 million additional rental expense recognized in second half 2007, following practical completion of our new London headquarters in June 2007 which gave us control of the building.  

Other expenses in 2007 also included $13 million of rent on our then existing London headquarters building, following its sale and leaseback in September 2006. We terminated this lease when we completed the move to our new London headquarters in April 2008. Of the $121 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the building, $22 million was deferred and subsquently recognized over the revised life of the lease, of which $14 million was recognized in 2007.   

 Depreciation and amortization   

Depreciation and amortization of $90 million in 2008 was $24 million higher than in 2007 with the increase primarily attributable to a $21 million charge in fourth quarter 2008 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the HRH acquisition.   

Depreciation and amortization was $66 million in 2007 compared to $63 million in 2006 with the increase mainly attributable to the initial depreciation of assets associated with World Financial Center, our new lease in New York.   

 Operating income and margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues)   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

40 

 2008 compared with 2007  

Operating margin was 18 percent in 2008 compared with 24 percent in 2007. This decrease reflected the impact of:   

the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points;   

a negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange movements as discussed in "General and administrative expenses" above;   

a $22 million increase in intangibles amortization, of which $21 million related to HRH;   

our continued investments in targeted new hires and Shaping our Future initiatives; and   

lower investment and other income;  

partly offset by   

increased productivity, with revenues at constant exchange rates per FTE employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;   

a $38 million benefit from the operating income contribution of HRH in the fourth quarter; and   

good cost control, the realization of savings from Shaping our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.   

 2007 compared with 2006  

Operating margin was 24 percent in 2007 compared with 23 percent in 2006. This increase reflected the impact of:   

the $105 million of expenditure in 2006 in support of the Shaping our Future strategic initiatives, equivalent to 4 percentage points; and   

a 4 percentage point improvement in our retail margin, reflecting the increased margins in both North America and International as a result of our focus on productivity and profitable growth, together with the benefit of lower charges for pensions and legal provisions in our UK and US operations;  

partly offset by   

the $102 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our London headquarters, equivalent to 4 percentage points; and   

a 2 percentage point reduction in Global's operating margin mainly reflecting the difficult reinsurance trading environment and an adverse impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by the benefit of our productivity initiatives and the benefit of lower charges for pensions and legal provisions.  

Operating segment margins are discussed further in "Operating ResultsSegment Information" below.   

 Interest expense   

Interest expense in 2008 of $105 million was $39 million higher than in 2007 with the increase reflecting:   

$18 million additional interest expense in 2008 relating to our new term loan and interim credit facilities connected with the HRH acquisition;   

a $9 million charge for amortization of debt fees associated with the above facilities;   

$9 million additional interest expense in 2008 due to fixed term $600 million senior notes issued in March 2007; and   

increased interest relating to higher average drawings under our revolving credit facilities.  

Interest expense was $66 million in 2007 compared with $38 million in 2006, with the increase due to higher average levels of debt at higher interest rates following the issuance of $600 million of senior notes in March 2007. Interest expense will increase in 2009 as a result of higher average levels of debt due to the HRH acquisition and higher rates of interest on the anticipated Goldman Sachs financing.

 Income taxes   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2008 compared with 2007  

The effective tax rate in 2008 was 24 percent compared with 26 percent in 2007, with the decrease in rate reflecting:   

a change in the geographical mix of profits with a greater proportion of profits being earned outside the United States;   

non-taxable exchange gains arising from the significant movement in the exchange rate between the US dollar and sterling; and   

a decrease in the statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK from 30 percent in 2007 to an effective rate of 28.5 percent in 2008;  

partly offset by   

the benefit of a $10 million release of tax provisions in 2007 compared to a $2 million release in 2008. Both 2008 and 2007   

benefited from the release of tax provisions relating to prior tax periods following the resolution of tax issues surrounding prior debt refinancing; and    

a one-off benefit of $4 million in 2007 relating to the restatement of the closing UK deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduced rate of corporation tax applicable on the reversal of those liabilities.  

 2007 compared with 2006  

The effective tax rate in 2007 was 26 percent compared with 12 percent in 2006. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 is primarily attributable to a $65 million tax credit in 2006 arising following the resolution of complex tax issues associated with the original KKR acquisition structure, together with a low tax rate on the gain on disposal of our previous London headquarters also in 2006.   

 Net income and diluted earnings per share   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2008 compared with 2007  

Net income for 2008 was $303 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, compared to $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of:   

the $66 million post-tax impact of charges associated with the 2008 expense review, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share; and   

a year on year accounting loss of $0.27 per diluted share primarily relating to the retranslation of our sterling denominated UK pension benefits asset as discussed in   

"General and administrative expenses" above;   

partly offset by   

strong organic revenue growth in 2008; and   

a year on year benefit from a lower effective tax rate of $0.09 per diluted share.  

HRH's fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs and intangible amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted share.  

Average diluted sharecount increased from 147 million in 2007 to 148 million in 2008 as the impact of the 11.5 million shares   

42 

repurchased under accelerated share repurchase programs in first half 2007 was more than offset by the additional 24.4 million shares issued on October 1, 2008 as part consideration for the HRH acquisition. The additional shares issued had a negative $0.11 cent impact on earnings per diluted share in 2008.  

 2007 compared with 2006  

Net income for 2007 was $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, compared with $449 million, or $2.84 per diluted share, in 2006 with the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of:   

the $94 million post-tax gain on the sale of our London headquarters in 2006, equivalent to $0.59 per diluted share;   

the $71 million tax credit in 2006 as discussed above, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share; and   

a $20 million post-tax increase in interest expense in 2007 reflecting increased long-term borrowing to fund share buybacks and   

additional pension contributions, equivalent to $0.14 per diluted share;   

partly offset by   

the $74 million post-tax impact of expenditure in 2006 to launch our Shaping our Future strategic initiatives, equivalent to $0.47 per diluted share; and   

increased revenues and the improved margin in 2007 as discussed above.  

Foreign currency translation had a $0.06 negative year on year impact on diluted earnings per share in 2007.  

Average diluted sharecount reduced from 158 million in 2006 to 147 million in 2007 primarily reflecting the impact of the 15 million shares repurchased under accelerated share repurchase programs in November 2006 and March 2007. After taking into account incremental funding costs, there was a $0.09 benefit to diluted earnings per share from these share buybacks for 2007.

             OPERATING RESULTSSEGMENT INFORMATION  

We organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International. Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities. North America and International   

comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and major corporates.  

The following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ending December 31, 2008:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $nil in 2007 and $2 million net operating loss for full year 2006, previously allocated to the operating segments, has been reported within Corporate. 

(ii)Corporate and other includes the $92 million cost of the 2008 expense review (2007: $nil, 2006: $101 million of expenditure on second half 2006 Shaping our Future initiatives), foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange on the UK pension plan asset of $47 million loss in 2008 (2007: $7 million, 2006: $10 million), amortization of intangible assets of $36 million (2007: $14 million, 2006: $12 million), net gains and losses on disposal of operations, certain legal costs, and in 2006 a $99 million gain on disposal of the Company's London headquarters net of leaseback costs.  

44 

 Global   

Our Global operations comprise Global Specialties and Reinsurance. The following table sets out revenues, organic revenue growth and   

operating income and margin for the three years ended December 31, 2008:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $1 million net operating profit for full year 2007 and $10 million net operating loss for full year 2006, previously allocated to the Global segment, has been reported within Corporate. 

(ii)Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 

(iii)Effective October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.   

Revenues: 2008 compared with 2007  

Commissions and fees were $34 million, or 5 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007 of which 3 percent was attributable to the net impact of acquisitions and disposals, mainly due to HRH's UK-based specialty business. There was no net impact from foreign currency translation as a benefit from the euro strengthening year on year against the dollar was offset by a negative impact from sterling weakening against the dollar.  

Organic revenue growth was 2 percent as the benefit of good growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by lower commissions and fees in Reinsurance.  

Global Specialties revenue growth reflected the benefit of good growth in Marine, Financial Institutions, Bloodstock, Jewelry, Specie and Global Markets and was achieved despite significant rate reductions.   

Organic revenues in Reinsurance in 2008 were adversely impacted by a combination of declining rates and a reduction in amounts reinsured. We continue to make investments in Reinsurance to strengthen capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market and are beginning to see the positive results of this investment as we move into 2009.  

Client retention levels in Global improved to 90 percent in 2008 compared with 89 percent in 2007.  

 Revenues: 2007 compared with 2006  

Commissions and fees were $13 million, or 2 percent, higher in 2007 compared with 2006 of which 1 percent was attributable to the net impact of acquisitions and disposals and 1 percent to foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth was flat in 2007 with the benefit of a 6 percent increase in Global   

45 

Specialties offset by a 4 percent decrease in Reinsurance.  

Global Specialties revenue growth reflected the benefit of one-time income from satellite launches and strong growth in Construction, especially in global infrastructure projects, together with good performances from Energy, Financial Institutions and Niche. This revenue growth was achieved despite significant rate reductions with rates decreasing in: Aerospace by some 15 to 20 percent year on year; Marine Hull by 15 to 20 percent; Marine cargo by 25 to 40 percent; and Financial Institutions, Energy and Niche by some 10 to 15 percent.  

Organic revenues in Reinsurance declined in 2007 and were adversely impacted by a combination of declining rates, a reduction in amounts reinsured and other changes, including recent changes in Florida legislation which significantly increased capacity and reduced prices.  

Operating margin: 2008 compared with 2007  

Operating margin in our Global operations was 29 percent in 2008 compared with 28 percent in 2007, as the benefit of organic revenue growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by the impact of lower revenues in Reinsurance and an adverse impact from foreign exchange.  

Operating margin in Global Specialties increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as the benefit from organic revenue growth, lower pension costs and our Shaping our Future initiatives more than offset further spend on targeted hires and strategic initiatives.  

Operating margin in Reinsurance in 2008 was broadly in line with 2007 as the impact of lower   

commissions and fees was largely offset by the benefits of Shaping our Future initiatives, lower pension costs and the positive results of our continued investments to strengthen capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market.  

 Operating margin: 2007 compared with 2006  

Operating margin in our Global operations was 28 percent in 2007 compared with 31 percent in 2006. Revenues in our Global operations are largely US dollar denominated while our expense base is primarily sterling denominated. The weakening of average dollar rates against sterling generated a negative 2 percentage point impact on Global's margin.  

Operating margin in Global Specialties decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 as the moderate revenue growth achieved against the backdrop of a very tough rate environment was more than offset by expense growth. The expense growth reflected an adverse impact from foreign exchange and continued hiring in targeted areas such as Construction, Energy and Financial Institutions, partly offset by the benefits of Shaping our Future initiatives, lower charges for pension costs and legal provisions and good cost control.  

Reinsurance's operating margin in 2007 was broadly in line with 2006 as the decline in revenues, an adverse impact from foreign exchange and our continued investment in analytics were offset by the benefit of lower charges for pension costs and legal provisions, and good cost control.

 North America   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)Other income represents gains on disposals of intangible assets, including books of business. Prior to January 1, 2008 these gains were reported within total commissions and fees but were excluded from organic revenue growth with effect from April 1, 2007. As a result of this change, $17 million previously reported within North America's commissions and fees in 2007, has been transferred to other income (2006: $12 million). 

(ii)In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $nil in 2007 and $3 million net operating profit for full year 2006, previously allocated to the North America segment, has been reported within Corporate. 

(iii)Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 

(iv)Effective October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.   

Revenues: 2008 compared with 2007  

Commissions and fees in North America were $161 million, or 21 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007, of which $181 million was attributable to HRH's fourth quarter 2008 revenues. Excluding HRH, organic commissions and fees declined by 1 percent reflecting the soft market conditions.  

Chicago, Georgia, Houston, Boston and Knoxville all generated growth in excess of 5 percent though several offices recorded significant declines in the difficult market conditions.  

The integration of the HRH acquisition made good progress in fourth quarter 2008 with only 2 percent attrition of legacy HRH producers since the announcement of the HRH acquisition in June 2008.   

Client retention levels improved to 91 percent in 2008, an increase of 3 percentage points from 2007, and productivity continued to improve with an approximately 2 percent rise in revenues per FTE employee in 2008 compared with 2007.  

 Revenues: 2007 compared with 2006  

Commissions and fees in North America were $7 million, or 1 percent, higher in 2007 compared with 2006 which was attributable to organic growth. The organic revenue growth was achieved in the face of declining rates across most regions of the United States: MarketScout data for 2007 showed average property and casualty rate declines in the year of 13 percent. Despite the declining rates, we saw good growth in the Southeast, Central and New York regions and in our program business and employee benefits.   

47 

The rate of organic revenue growth moderated in 2007 compared to previous years as the focus was on profitable growth. From mid-2006 we moderated the pace of hiring and at the same time managed out under performers. Consequently, while there was a year on year decline in producers, revenue per FTE employee was 5 percent higher in 2007 compared with 2006.  

Operating margin: 2008 compared with 2007  

Operating margin in North America in 2008 was 15 percent compared with 19 percent in 2007. The decrease of 4 percentage points reflected:   

lower commissions and fees, reflecting the soft market conditions;   

a $15 million decrease in other income compared with 2007 which benefited from higher than usual proceeds from the sale of books of business; and   

continued spend on targeted new hires and other initiatives;  

partly offset by   

the acquisition of HRH which contributed $38 million of operating income in fourth quarter 2008; and   

the benefit of increased revenue per FTE employee and other cost savings.  

 Operating margin: 2007 compared with 2006  

Operating margin in North America was 19 percent in 2007 compared with 17 percent in 2006 and reflected the benefit of the increased revenue per employee and effective expense control, together with a $5 million increase in proceeds from the sale of books of business. Margin improvement was most significant in our New York and Central regions.   

 International   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)Other income represents gains on disposals of intangible assets, including books of business. Prior to January 1, 2008 these gains were reported within total commissions and fees but were excluded from organic revenue growth with effect from April 1, 2007. As a result of this change, $2 million previously reported within International's commissions and fees in 2007, has been transferred to other income (2006: $1 million). 

(ii)In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $1 million net operating loss for full year 2007 and $5 million net operating loss for full year 2006, previously allocated to the International segment, has been reported within Corporate. 

(iii)Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 

(iv)Effective October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.  

48 

 Revenues: 2008 compared with 2007  

Commissions and fees in International were $93 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2008 compared with 2007.  

A significant part of International's revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar and foreign currency translation benefited 2008 revenues by 1 percent compared with 2007.  

Organic revenue growth of 9 percent in 2008 was achieved despite declining rates in most countries.  

We have seen consistent growth in our International business over the last three years, with all twelve quarters in this period showing growth of 5 percent or higher, with Spain, Denmark and Latin America continuing to contribute significantly.  

Productivity in International continued to improve with revenues per FTE employee rising by 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 and average client retention levels remaining high at 91 percent.  

 Revenues: 2007 compared with 2006  

Commissions and fees in International were $115 million, or 14 percent, higher in 2007 compared with 2006. Some 6 percent of this increase was attributable to foreign currency translation as a significant part of International's revenues are earned in currencies that have strengthened against the dollar on a year on year basis, in particular the euro. Organic growth of 8 percent was achieved despite declining rates in most countries, with decreases of between 5 and 20 percent.   

Organic growth in 2008 was driven by the emerging markets, particularly Latin America, China and Asia, all of which continued to generate strong double-digit growth. The emerging market growth was complemented by good growth in mainland Europe, especially in the Nordic region, Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe. However, there was a modest decline in our UK and Irish operations revenues compared with 2006 primarily due to the declining rates environment, with decreases averaging between 15 and 20 percent.  

 Operating margin: 2008 compared with 2007  

Operating margin in International was 28 percent in 2008 compared with 25 percent in 2007, with the 3 percentage point improvement reflecting the strong organic revenue growth, increased productivity and continued expense discipline partly offset by significant investment in targeted hires and the adverse impact of declining rates in most countries.  

 Operating margin: 2007 compared with 2006  

Operating margin in International was 25 percent in 2007 compared with 20 percent in 2006, with the 5 percentage point improvement reflecting the strong organic revenue growth, particularly in the emerging markets, coupled with sustained cost control and a lower UK pension expense.  

Significant operating margin improvement was reported across most areas of our International segment as the effect of strong organic revenue growth, our productivity efficiencies and joint focus more than offset the adverse impact of declining rates in most countries.   

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance. Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.   

 Pension expense  

We maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover a majority of our employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in Ireland, Germany, Denmark   

49 

and the Netherlands: these schemes have combined total assets of $89 million and a combined liability for pension benefits of $29 million as of December 31, 2008. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.  

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination.   

We recorded a net pension credit on our UK and US defined benefit pension plans in 2008 of $25 million, compared to a net pension credit of $10 million in 2007, an increase of $15 million.  

The UK plan increase was $17 million mainly reflecting an increase in the expected return on assets in the UK plan due to higher asset levels following significant additional contributions in 2007 and 2008 and increased member contributions in 2008. The US pension charge was $2 million higher in 2008 compared with 2007.  

Based on December 31, 2008 assumptions, we expect the net pension credit in 2008 to decrease to a net pension expense in 2009 of between $50 to $60 million due to lower expected asset returns and increased amortization following the significant asset losses in the UK and US during 2008.   

 UK plan   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)With all other assumptions held constant. 

(2)Assumes all plan participants are one year younger.  

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in 2008 remained unchanged at 7.75 percent, equivalent to an expected return in 2008 of $184 million. The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

During the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our pension plans has been significantly adversely affected by the turmoil in worldwide markets. The holdings of equity securities by our UK and US pension plans have been particularly affected.  

Rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at December 31, 2008 were based on yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities was 6.5 percent compared with 5.9 percent at December 31, 2007 with the increase reflecting an increase in UK long-term bond rates in the latter part of 2008. The higher discount rate and reduced inflation assumption generated an actuarial gain of $248 million at December 31, 2008.   

50 

Mortality assumptions at December 31, 2008 were changed from December 31, 2007. The new mortality assumption is the 100 percent PNA00 table without an age adjustment. As an   

indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2008 would have a life expectancy of 22 years.   

 US plan   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)With all other assumptions held constant. 

(2)Assumes all plan participants are one year younger.  

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net US pension scheme expense in 2008 was 8.0 percent, consistent with 2007. The rate used to discount US plan liabilities at December 31, 2008 was 6.3 percent, determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve, an increase from 6.0 percent at December 31, 2007. The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The mortality assumption at December 31, 2008 is the RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and non-annuitants), projected to 2009 by Scale AA (December 31, 2007: projected to 2008 by Scale AA). As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2008, would have a life expectancy of 18 years.  

 Intangible assets  

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of   

businesses acquired. We classify our intangible assets into three categories:   

Goodwill;   

"Customer and Marketing related" includes client lists, client relationships and non-compete agreements; and   

"Contract based, Technology and Other" includes all other purchased intangible assets.  

Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed. Over 80 percent of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition are amortized over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.  

To determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the HRH acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified independent appraiser. The calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions. We base our allocation on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets.   

51 

 Impairment review  

We review all our intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually) or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including:   

the identification of reporting units;   

assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units; and   

determination of fair value of each reporting unit.  

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated against our market capitalization. This analysis requires significant judgments, including:   

estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts;   

estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business;   

the estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur; and   

determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, did not result in an impairment charge (2007: $nil, 2006: $nil).  

 Income taxes  

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are   

expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.  

At December 31, 2008, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $362 million (2007: $184 million) against which a valuation allowance of $85 million (2007: $69 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:   

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current projections;   

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize;   

new tax planning strategies are developed; or   

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry forward time limits,  

the Company may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.  

Positions taken in the Company's tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions.  

 Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities  

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and insurance claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating   

52 

principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have   

been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice.   

 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

New accounting standards issued during the year that would have a significant impact on the   

Company's reporting are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

On October 1, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of HRH.  

Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of HRH for $46.00 per share, with approximately 55 percent of the total consideration being paid in cash and 45 percent being paid in our stock. The total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion included the assumption of approximately $340 million of HRH existing debt.  

We funded the transaction on October 1, 2008 from committed bank financing, with a $1 billion drawdown from an interim credit facility and a $525 million draw down from a $700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, we repaid approximately $340 million of HRH existing debt and the $170 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility, which has been replaced by a new $300 million facility, all of which remains available to draw at December 31, 2008.  

During fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the then outstanding $1 billion balance on the interim credit facility funded by using free cash flow of $75 million together with the drawdown of the remaining $175 million available under the 5-year term loan facility.  

Total long term debt at December 31, 2008 was $1,865 million and total short term debt was $785 million. Included in total long-term debt is $250 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2010.  

In February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to   

close during March 2009. The net proceeds of the issue will be used to repay approximately $480 million of the interim credit facility. We expect to be able to repay the approximately $270 million remaining balance on this short-term facility over the next two quarters from free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses.  

 Liquidity  

We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 of $176 million, the consummation of the agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue $500 million of senior unsecured notes, availability under our $300 million revolving credit facility together with future generation of free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses should be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance full repayment of the interim credit facility, current portions of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and presently known operating needs.  

Long-term liquidity for debt service and other contractual obligations will be dependent on continued generation of free cash flow and, given favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancing. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as various uncertainties discussed in this section and elsewhere, which could require us to pursue other financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancing, asset sales or other financing alternatives. With the current tightening in the   

53 

credit markets, the level, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured.  

We continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. These actions include the rationalization of our cost base through the 2008 expense review and our ongoing right-sizing initiatives to achieve best fit within the current environment.  

On November 1, 2007, the Board authorized a new share buyback program for $1 billion. This replaced our previous $1 billion buyback program and its remaining $308 million authorization. In first quarter 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $75 million under the new authorization.  

Over time, following full repayment of the interim credit facility, and subject to limitations in our debt facilities, we also plan to repurchase the majority of the shares issued in connection with the acquisition of HRH under our existing $1 billion buyback authorization.  

 Fiduciary funds  

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. All these balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet. We earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity, and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes.  

 Own funds  

As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $176 million, compared with $200 million at December 31, 2007, and all of   

our $300 million revolving credit facility remained available to draw.  

 Operating activities  

Net cash provided by operations was $211 million in 2008 compared with $268 million in 2007 and $147 million in 2006. Net cash provided by operations has been significantly impacted by the accelerated funding of our pensions schemes over the last three years, with additional contributions of $107 million in 2008, $153 million in 2007 and $211 million in 2006.  

Net cash from operations in 2008 was $57 million lower than in 2007, mainly reflecting:   

an $81 million decrease in net income before gains relating to investment activities; and   

a $65 million increase in cash payments for interest reflecting higher average debt levels, particularly following the funding of the HRH acquisition;  

partly offset by   

a $46 million reduction in additional contributions to our UK and US defined benefit pension plans;   

the benefit of a $14 million reduction in taxes paid; and   

the timing of cash collections and other working capital movements.  

Net cash from operations in 2007 was $121 million higher than in 2006, mainly reflecting:   

a $27 million increase in net income before gains relating to investment activities;   

a $58 million reduction in additional contributions to our UK and US defined benefit pension plans; and   

the benefit of a $13 million reduction in taxes paid.  

 Investing activities  

Total net cash used in investing activities was $1,040 million in 2008 compared with $221 million in 2007 and an inflow of $67 million in 2006.   

54 

The net increase in cash used in investing activities of $819 million in 2008 compared with 2007 was attributable to:   

an $896 million net increase in the cost of acquisitions, primarily reflecting $926 million attributable to the HRH acquisition; and   

a reduction in proceeds from disposals of operations, investments and other assets of $14 million;  

partly offset by   

a reduction in fixed asset spend of $91 million, principally attributable to sharply reduced expenditure on our new London and US headquarters buildings following their completion.  

The net increase in cash used in investing activities of $288 million in 2007 compared with 2006 was mainly attributable to:   

a $130 million increased investment in fixed assets primarily relating to $106 million of expenditure on the fit-outs of our new US and UK headquarters buildings; and   

cash proceeds on disposal of fixed and intangible assets of $27 million in 2007 compared with $205 million in 2006, primarily reflecting the $202 million proceeds on sale of our London headquarters in 2006.  

In 2008 we completed the acquisition of HRH with approximately 55 percent of the total consideration being paid in cash, as described above. This payment for acquisitions of $926 million was in addition to a payment of $31 million to acquire an additional 4 percent of voting rights in Gras Savoye & Cie, our French associate. We also acquired a further 5.5 percent of Gras Savoye & Cie effective fourth quarter 2008 for which the $41 million in cash was paid in January 2009. The Gras Savoye acquisitions were pursuant to put arrangements, see "Contractual Obligations" below.  

In 2007 we purchased an additional 17 percent of Coyle Hamilton Willis (since renamed Willis Risk Services Ireland Limited), our Irish subsidiary, for $33 million; and acquired InsuranceNoodle, a US internet distributor of small business property-casualty insurance for $29 million.   

 Financing activities  

Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $828 million in 2008 compared with outflows of $146 million in 2007 and $129 million in 2006.  

 Long-term debt  

In connection with the HRH acquisition on October 1, 2008, we drew down $1 billion from an interim credit facility and a further $525 million from a 5-year term loan facility. During fourth quarter 2008, we subsequently repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance on the interim credit facility using $175 million proceeds from an additional drawdown of the 5-year term loan facility together with $75 million from free cash flow.  

As at December 31, 2008, total short-term debt was $785 million and total long-term debt was $1,865 million.  

In February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during March 2009. We expect the net proceeds of the issue to be used to repay approximately a further $480 million of the $750 million outstanding balance on the interim credit facility as at December 31, 2008.  

In addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our previously existing revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new 5-year $300 million line of credit.  

We also repaid the previously existing HRH debt of $341 million assumed with the acquisition.  

In March 2007, we issued $600 million of 10 year senior notes at 6.20 percent. We used the proceeds of the notes to fund share buybacks and to repay a net $150 million on our then existing revolving credit facility.  

In 2006, we drew down $200 million on our then existing revolving credit facility primarily to fund our increased pension contributions.   

55 

 Share buybacks  

We repurchased 2.3 million shares for $75 million of cash in the first quarter of 2008 compared with 11.5 million shares for $480 million of cash in 2007 and 5.4 million shares for $211 million of cash in 2006.   

 Dividends  

Cash dividends paid in 2008 were $146 million compared with $143 million in 2007 and $145 million in 2006. In February 2009, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share, an annual rate of $1.04 per share.   

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  

Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 were:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(i)Presented gross. 

(ii)Based on the earliest dates on which options could be exercised.   

 Debt financing  

On October 1, 2008, we funded the HRH acquisition with $1 billion from an interim credit facility and $525 million from a $700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility and replaced this with a new $300 million line of credit. In fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the interim credit facility and at the same time drew down a further $175 million under the 5-year term loan facility.  

In February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Company   

anticipates that approximately $480 million net proceeds of this issuance will be applied towards the balance of the interim credit facility. Consummation of the issuance, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to take place in March 2009.  

 Operating leases  

We moved from Ten Trinity Square into our new London headquarters in Lime Street in April 2008. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement to lease the Lime Street building and took control of the building in June 2007 under a 25 year operating lease. Annual rentals are $35 million per year and we have subleased approximately 30 percent of the premises under leases up to 15 years long. The outstanding   

56 

contractual obligation for lease rentals at December 31, 2008 was $720 million and the amounts receivable from committed subleases was $106 million.  

 Pensions  

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans.  

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our UK defined benefit plan with the plan's trustees. In February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the UK plan of $37 million for 2009 through 2012. However, if certain funding targets are not met at the beginning of 2010 and 2011, full year contributions for these years will increase to $74 million.  

For the US plan, expected contributions are the contributions we will be required to make under US pension legislation based on our December 31, 2008 balance sheet position. We currently expect to contribute $18 million in 2009 and between $45 and $50 million per year from 2010 to 2013.  

 Put options relating to subsidiaries and associates  

In connection with many of our investments in less than wholly-owned subsidiaries and associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership percentage over time, typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain instances, the other owners have a right, typically at a price calculated pursuant to a formula based on revenues or earnings, to put some or all of their shares to us.  

As part of the 1997 acquisition of our initial 33 percent shareholding of Gras Savoye, we entered into a put arrangement, whereby the other shareholders in Gras Savoye (primarily two families, two insurance companies and Gras Savoye's executive management team) could put their shares to us. Until 2011, we will be obligated to buy the shares of certain   

shareholders to the extent those shareholders put their shares, potentially increasing our ownership from the 48 percent holding at December 31, 2008 to 90 percent if all shareholders put their shares, at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue.  

Management shareholders of Gras Savoye (representing approximately 10 percent of shares) do not have general put rights before 2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability or retirement from which payments, at December 31, 2008 based on the formula would not have exceeded $67 million. The shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period.  

We believe that, should the aggregate amount of Gras Savoye shares be put to us, sufficient funds would be available to satisfy this obligation. In addition, we have a call option to move to majority ownership under certain circumstances and in any event by December 2009. Upon exercising this call option, the remaining Gras Savoye shareholders have a put option.  

We recently received a notification from one of the shareholders of Gras Savoye, namely AXA Corporate Solutions, informing us of its intention to put its shares in Gras Savoye to us, subject to the pre-emption provisions set out in bye-laws of Gras Savoye. The shares held by AXA represent approximately 4 percent of the share capital of Gras Savoye. Notwithstanding that we have received this notice from AXA we believe that it is likely that we will not be required to acquire all of the AXA shares in the immediate future or, in some circumstances, at all. We believe that either:-   

Gras Savoye itself will buy back all the AXA shares on 23 March 2009 and as a result, we would not acquire any of them; or   

AXA will agree to extend the date for payment of the amount due in respect of the AXA shares and that Gras Savoye itself will buy back all the AXA shares on the agreed date for payment. In these circumstances we believe that Gras Savoye will buy back all the AXA shares and would agree to pay the amount due in respect of the shares into an   

57 

escrow account to be paid to AXA upon completion of the acquisition of the shares. Again, as a result, we would not be required to acquire any of the shares; or    

certain of the other shareholders of Gras Savoye will exercise their pre-emption rights to acquire a portion of the AXA shares. In these circumstances we believe that AXA would withdraw its notification in respect of the remaining shares held by it although we believe that it would then exercise its right to put those to us later in 2009.   

In the event that none of the above occurred or an alternative arrangement was agreed, we would be required to acquire the AXA shares on 23 March 2009. The amount payable by us for the AXA shares would be approximately $25 million.  

 Off-balance sheet transactions  

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
