ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

All financial instruments described in this section are held for purposes other than trading.

Interest Rate Risk

The tables below provide information about long-term debt issued by the Company and Consolidated SCE&G and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and related maturities. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices. Interest rate swap agreements are valued using discounted cash flow models with independently sourced data.

 While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur.
