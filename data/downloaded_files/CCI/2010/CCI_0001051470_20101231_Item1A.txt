Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully consider all of the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities.

Our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand.

Demand for our towers depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers, which, in turn, depends on the demand for wireless voice and data services by their customers. The willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our towers, is affected by numerous factors, including:

• consumer demand for wireless services;

• availability and capacity of our towers and the land under those towers;

• location of our towers;

• financial condition of our customers, including their availability and cost of capital;

 • willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their capital expenditures;

• increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our customers;

• mergers or consolidations among our customers;

• changes in, or succe ss of, our customers' business models;

• governmental regulations, including local and state restrictions on the proliferation of towers;

• cost of constructing towers;

• technological changes, including those affecting (1) the number or type of towers or other communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area and (2) the obsolescence of certain existing wireless networks; and

7

• our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers' service requirements.

A slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our towers may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. Over the last several years, new ent rants in the marketplace, such as those providing wireless data technologies, have accounted for a significant portion of our new tenant additions. Our expectations for future demand for our towers is based in part on new entrants into the wireless communications industry with unproven business models. The success of new entrants can be influenced by numerous factors, including the items described above, particularly the availability and cost of capital and the success of their business models. If our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth and the demand for our towers and network services. 

A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of, or network sharing among, any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues and reduce demand for our towers and network services.

For 2010, approximately 73% of our consolidated revenues was derived from AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile, which represented 21%, 21%, 20% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy, insolvency, consolidation, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our customers, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, towers assets, site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets, and (4) other adverse effects to our business. We cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us. Se e also "Item 1. Business—The Company."

Consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers. In addition, consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers' future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. For example, Verizon Wireless acquired Alltel in 2009. In addition, Sprint merged with Nextel in August 2005, resulting in their use of two separate wireless technologies. During 2010, Sprint announced multi-year network plans to consolidate their multiple network technologies, including the elimination of their narrow-band push-to-talk network, referred to as iDEN, which is scheduled to be ph ased out over a period of time beginning in 2013. These plans by Sprint may result in their not renewing certain contracts with us. Any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows.

Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.

As a result of our substantial indebtedness:

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments and other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;

• we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in "Item 1. Business;"

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the industry;

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;

• we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations; and

• we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including tower development and mergers and acquisitions.

Currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions. Our subsidiaries, under thei r debt instruments, are also required to maintain specific financial ratios. Our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with the debt restrictions, we will be in default under those instruments, which would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. If our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing the debt, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers. See also "Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants." 

CCIC and CCOC are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries. Accordingly, CCIC's 

8

and CCOC's respective sources of cash to pay interest and principal on their outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. Earnings and cash flows generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries in conducting their operations, including the service of their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to a holding company, in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default. However, their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedn ess (approximately $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2010), which we will need to refinance or repay. See "Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. We are also required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 6.25% convertible preferred stock in August 2012 for approximately $318.1 million, plus any unpaid dividends on that preferred stock. There can be n o assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock, or at all.

Beginning in 2008, the global economy entered a recession, and the credit markets underwent a period of substantial volatility and disruption. Although economic conditions and credit markets have improved during 2009 and 2010, uncertainty and weakness continues. Any renewed financial turmoil, worsening credit environment, economic weakness and uncertainty could impact the availability and cost of debt financing, including with respect to any refinancing of the obligations described above.

If we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our planned capital expenditures. In such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations. Failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. Assuming we meet certain financial ratios, we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above.

Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 5, 2011, we had 290.9 million shares of common stock outstanding, and we reserved (1) 8.9 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans and (2) 8.6 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. 

In addition, a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If any one of these stockholders, or any group of our stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.

A wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our towers and network services).

Historically, the amount of our customers' network investment is cyclical and has varied based upon the various matters described in these risk factors. Changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our towers. As a result, changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new technologies or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our towers. Furthermore, the wireless communication industry could experience a slow down or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless services and general economic conditions. There can be no assurances that the weakness and uncertainty in the current economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our towers and network services. In addition, such a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers and network services. A wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.

As a result of competition in our industry, including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts.

Our growth is dependent on entering into new customer contracts as well as renewing or reletting customer contracts when existing customer contracts terminate. We face competition for site rental customers f rom various sources, including:

• other independent tower owners or operators;

• wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease antenna space to other wireless communication companies;

• owners of alternative facilities including rooftops, water towers, distributed antenna systems, broadcast towers and utility poles; and

• new alternative deployment methods in the wireless communication industry.

Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios are generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have. Competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share.

New technologies may significantly reduce demand for our towers and negatively impact our revenues.

Improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our towers. For example, signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and, thereby, multiple customers may reduce the need for our towers. In addition, other technologies, such as Wi-Fi, femtocells, picocells, satellite transmission systems (such as low earth orbiting), and DAS networks, may, in the future, serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on towers had such technologies not existed. Any significant reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or o therwise have a material adverse effect on us.

New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected.

There can be no assurances that new wireless services and technologies, such as 4G, will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries. In addition, demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities and demand for our towers as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.

If we fail to retain rights to our towers, including the land under our towers, our business may be adversely affected.

Our property interests relating to the land on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. Our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land or to renegotiate and extend the terms of the leases relating to such land. Approximately 9% of our site rental gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2010 are derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers have final expiration dates of less than ten years. If we are unable to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside, our business may be adversely affected.

Approximately 6,500 of our towers are leased or operated for an initial period of 32 years (through May 2037) under master leases and subleases with Sprint ("Sprint Towers"). We have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the Sprint Towers from Sprint for approximately $2.3 billion. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these towers at the end of the applicable period. Even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase the Sprint Towers for business or other reasons. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of the Sprint Towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business.

Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.

The operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. Our network services business may be adversely impacted by various factors including competition, economic weakness and uncertainty, our market share, and changes in the type and volume of work performed.

If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined 

10

or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.

A variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in "Item 1. Business." Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including state and local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business, increase delays or result in additional costs. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us.

If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs and revenues.

The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of can cer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.

Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services. If a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insur ance with respect to these matters.

Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti-takeover provisions include:

• a staggered board of directors;

• the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; and 

• advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings.

Our by-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as w ell as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.

In addition, domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.

We may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency e xchange rates relating to our operations in Australia.

Our Australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2010, approximately 5% of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in Australian dollars. Over the past five years, the Australian dollar has strengthened by 29% against the U.S. dollar. We have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our Australian operations, and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates.
