Enterprise Strategy

In 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy with the objective of fully leveraging ITW’s core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance. ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.

The foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the ITW Business Model consisting of three core elements:

80/20 Business Process - The concept of the 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. The Company utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:

•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or eliminating low-value products.

•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.

•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.

•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.

The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs, and improve profitability and returns.

Customer-Back Innovation - ITW’s customer-back approach to innovation builds on the Company’s 80/20 business process to help ITW businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems. ITW businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW. The Company actively protects its innovation through a patent portfolio of approximately 10,000 active patents.

Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture - ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets.

Key Initiatives 

ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns. 

Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth, while acquisitions will be targeted to bolt-on acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments, and new platforms that expand the Company’s long-term growth and earnings potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.

Another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification. Product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the Company's 80/20 business process. In the short-term, product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. Over the long-term, product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue, profitability and returns, and is key to improving the Company's long-term operating and financial performance.

Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.

Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses. 

Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment

On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Effective November 1, 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

The Decorative Surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.

Divestiture of the Industrial Packaging Segment

In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. 

On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations.

Competition

With operations in 57 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the Welding segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and ESAB.

In virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference, service delivery and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments. The Company believes that each segment's primary competitive advantages derive from the Company's business model and decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the Company's 80/20 business process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Automotive OEM segment.

Raw Materials

The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.

Research and Development

Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment all contribute to the Company's organic growth. Many new products are designed to reduce customers' costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly or improving the quality of customers' assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $227 million in 2014, $240 million in 2013 and $240 million in 2012.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns approximately 3,400 unexpired U.S. patents and 6,600 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,600 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,100 applications pending in foreign patent offices. There is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains a patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.

The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company's patents would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.

In addition to patents, many of the Company's products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate.

Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows. 

Employees

The Company employed approximately 49,000 persons as of December 31, 2014 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

International

The Company's international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 56 foreign countries on six continents.
