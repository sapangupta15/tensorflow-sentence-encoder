PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of rental apartment properties in urban and high-density suburban coastal gateway markets where today's affluent renters want to live, work and play. ERP Operating Limited Partnership ("ERPOP"), an Illinois limited partnership, was formed in May 1993 to conduct the multifamily residential property business of Equity Residential. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT. References to the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively EQR, ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EQR and/or ERPOP. References to the "Operating Partnership" mean collectively ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ERPOP. 

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2016 owned an approximate 96.2% ownership interest in, ERPOP. All of the Company's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR issues public equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute to ERPOP, but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 302 properties located in 10 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 77,458 apartment units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):

The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices in each of its six core coastal markets. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 2,700 employees who provided real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.

Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies

The Company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital. 

We seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation. We are focused on the six coastal markets of Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California (including Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego), San Francisco and Seattle. These markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents:

7
▪High home ownership costs;

▪Strong economic growth leading to job growth and household formation, which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments;

▪Urban core and high-density suburban locations with an attractive quality of life leading to high resident demand and retention; 

▪Favorable demographics contributing to a larger pool of target residents with a high propensity to rent apartments; and

▪Higher barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is typically more difficult or costly to build new apartment properties, creating limits on new supply.

We believe our strategy also capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit, entertainment and cultural amenities. Millennials, the 83 million people between ages 18 and 34, are a prime apartment rental demographic. Reports also show a growing trend among aging Baby Boomers, a demographic of more than 76 million people between the ages of 53 and 71, toward apartment rentals. We believe that both groups appreciate the locational values described above as well as the flexibility that rental apartments offer.

Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. Revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties, cost-effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration. While we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends. 

We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases, review their accounts and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line.

Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt, sales of properties and joint venture agreements. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially occupied properties and may acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future. The Company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings.

Over the past several years, the Company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable, close-in suburban assets. Since 2005, the Company has sold nearly 198,000 apartment units primarily located in the less dense portions of suburban markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately $23.5 billion, acquired nearly 69,000 apartment units primarily located in urban and high-density suburban markets for approximately $20.0 billion and began approximately $5.7 billion of development projects primarily located in urban and high-density suburban markets. We are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas: Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. The sale of the Starwood Portfolio (as defined below) combined with the other 2016 dispositions has resulted in the Company's exit from the South Florida, Denver and New England (excluding Boston) markets and has substantially completed the Company's portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago. See further discussion below regarding the Company's 2016 disposition activity.

We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. We have a commitment to diversity in all of its forms and strive to promote and maintain a work environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect, offered opportunities for professional development and valued for their unique contributions to the Company's success. We provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements, equipment and appliances. We actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. We monitor our employees' engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores.

We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. Sustainability and social responsibility are key drivers of our focus on creating the best apartment communities for residents to live, work and play. We have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including investment activities, development, property operations and property management activities. With its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban and close-in suburban locations near public transportation. When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting, HVAC and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption. The Company was named the 2016 Global Residential Listed Sector Leader in Sustainability by GRESB, a globally recognized analysis of the sustainability indicators of more than 750 real estate portfolios worldwide. The Company was also recently awarded the Residential Leader in the Light award for sustainability by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). For additional information regarding our sustainability efforts, see our December 2016 Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report at our website, www.equityapartments.com. For 2017, we continue to have an express company-wide goal regarding enhanced sustainability efforts. Employees, including our executives, will have their performance against our various social responsibility goals evaluated as part of our annual performance review process.

Competition

All of the Company's properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company's ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Company's managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to competition.

Starwood Transaction

Following the approval by the Company's Board of Trustees, the Company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of Starwood Capital Group ("Starwood") on October 23, 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23,262 apartment units located in five markets across the United States for $5.365 billion (the "Starwood Transaction" or "Starwood Portfolio"). On January 26 and 27, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of the entire portfolio described above. The sale of the Starwood Portfolio, combined with the other 2016 dispositions, has resulted in the Company's exit from the South Florida, Denver and New England (excluding Boston) markets and has substantially completed the Company's portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago. These sales have narrowed the Company's focus, which is now entirely directed towards our six coastal markets. We believe the assets sold will have lower long-term returns (as compared to investments in our six coastal markets) and that we sold them for prices that are favorable. Given the strong demand for multifamily assets in our six coastal markets from institutional investors and the challenge in recycling $6.8 billion of capital in this competitive marketplace, the Company believed the best risk-adjusted use of the sale proceeds was to distribute a portion to our shareholders and use the remainder to repay outstanding debt (see further discussion below).

The Company used the majority of the proceeds from the Starwood Transaction and other 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of OP Units of $11.00 per share/unit in the aggregate. The Company paid special dividends of $8.00 per share/unit (approximately $3.0 billion) on March 10, 2016 and $3.00 per share/unit (approximately $1.1 billion) on October 14, 2016. The Company used the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral. The Company retired approximately $2.0 billion in secured and unsecured debt, the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017, improving the Company's already strong credit metrics. 

Debt and Equity Activity

EQR issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of ERPOP. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. In addition, ERPOP issues OP Units and preference interests ("Preference Units") from time to time.

Per the terms of ERPOP’s partnership agreement, EQR contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or preference units (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis).

Credit Facilities

EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. EQR guarantees the Operating Partnership’s revolving credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

On November 3, 2016, the Company replaced its existing $2.5 billion facility with a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing January 10, 2022. The Company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $750.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. The interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 0.825%), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the Company pays an annual facility fee (currently 12.5 basis points). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long-term debt.

The Company's previous $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility was set to mature on April 2, 2018. The Company had the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. The interest rate on advances under the facility was generally LIBOR plus a spread (was 0.95% at termination), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the Company paid an annual facility fee (was 15 basis points at termination). Both the spread and the facility fee were dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long-term debt. 

On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program in the United States. The Company may borrow up to a maximum of $500.0 million under this program subject to market conditions. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Company does not intend to borrow more than $2.0 billion on the commercial paper program and new revolving credit facility combined. As of February 17, 2017, there was a balance of $100.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2016, there was a balance of $20.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2015, there was a balance of $387.3 million on the commercial paper program ($387.5 million in principal outstanding net of an unamortized discount of $0.2 million). The notes bear interest at various floating rates with a weighted average of 0.90% and 0.56% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a weighted average maturity of 4 days and 19 days as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As of February 17, 2017, no amounts were outstanding and the amount available on the revolving credit facility was $1.88 billion (net of $20.6 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $100.0 million outstanding

on the commercial paper program). As of December 31, 2016, the amount available on the revolving credit facility was $1.96 billion (net of $20.6 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $20.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 1.37%. As of December 31, 2015, the amount available on the revolving credit facility was $2.07 billion (net of $45.1 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $387.5 million outstanding on the commercial paper program). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 1.07%.
