Tesoro Logistics LP

As part of our business strategy, we formed Tesoro Logistics LP (“TLLP”) to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. In April 2011, TLLP completed the initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 14,950,000 common units at a price of $21.00 per unit, which included a 1,950,000 share over-allotment option that was exercised by the underwriters. Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), a 100% consolidated subsidiary, serves as the general partner of TLLP. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, TLLP's assets consist of a crude oil gathering system in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area, eight refined products terminals in the western United States, a crude oil and refined products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah.

TLLP intends to expand its business through organic growth, including constructing new assets and increasing the utilization of existing assets, and by acquiring assets from us and third parties. Although we have historically operated our logistics assets primarily to support our refining and marketing business, we intend to grow our logistics operations to maximize the integrated value of our assets within the midstream and downstream value chain. We believe TLLP is well positioned to achieve its primary business objectives and execute business strategies based on its:

•long-term fee-based contracts;

•relationship with us;

•assets positioned in the high demand Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area; and 

•financial flexibility.

We hold an approximate 52% interest in TLLP, including the interest of the general partner. This interest includes 304,890 common units, 15,254,890 subordinated units and 622,649 general partner units. We received net proceeds of approximately $283 million from the Offering, after deducting offering expenses (the “Offering Costs”) and debt issuance costs. TLLP retained $3 million for working capital purposes and paid $2 million in connection with entering into its revolving credit facility.

Effective on the closing date of the Offering, TLLP entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (“TLLP Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions, which provides for borrowings under a revolving credit facility with total loan availability of $150 million. TLLP borrowed $50 million under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Offering. TLLP distributed total proceeds to us of $333 million, which includes $283 million from the Offering and $50 million from the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, in consideration of assets contributed and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to these assets. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP (which is TLLP's general partner), and is guaranteed by all of TLLP's subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of TLLP's assets. For additional information regarding our credit facilities, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity.”

Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal

In December 2011, we announced our intention to offer TLLP the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal and are currently in negotiations with TLLP. The terminal consists of a single-berth dock, five crude oil storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of 425,000 barrels and related pipelines that receive crude oil from third-party marine vessels for delivery to our Martinez refinery and a third-party terminal. Total throughput capacity for the terminal is estimated to be approximately 145 thousand barrels per day (“Mbpd”). The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012. The growth of TLLP helps us capture the value of our embedded logistics assets. As we are the general partner, and hold the related incentive distribution rights, we receive an increasing share in the incremental distributable cash flow the partnership generates.

Unit Train Unloading Facility

In July 2011, we announced that we expect to offer the unit train unloading facility at our Washington refinery to TLLP upon completion of construction, which is expected to be in the fourth quarter of 2012. The project includes unloading facilities for trains of rail cars ("unit trains") and is expected to deliver up to 30 Mbpd of Bakken crude oil to our Washington refinery.

Retail Acquisitions

During 2011, we entered into agreements to expand our network of retail stations with the addition of 290 stations between 2012 and 2014, as part of our commitment to enhancing integration and growing our marketing business. 

We entered into an agreement with SUPERVALU, Inc. in September 2011, to acquire approximately 50 retail stations located primarily in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. In January 2012, we completed the acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately $36 million, including inventories of approximately $3 million. We assumed the obligations under the seller's leases and other agreements arising after the closing date. SUPERVALU, Inc. retained certain pre-closing liabilities, including environmental matters. We intend to invest approximately $5 million to rebrand these stations from which we expect fuels sales of approximately 5 Mbpd. 

We entered into an agreement with Thrifty Oil Co. and certain of its affiliates effective August 2011, to lease approximately 240 retail stations located primarily in southern California, for an aggregate amount of approximately $25 million annually. We estimate that these stations will provide an additional 20-25 Mbpd of ratable off-take for our refining system after we invest approximately $30 million to rebrand the network. Each retail station lease is for an initial term of 10 years, with the option to renew for two additional five-year terms. We are scheduled to take possession of the retail stations in a phased transition, with approximately 190 stations taken during the course of 2012 and the balance to come during 2014. 

Hawaii Operations

We announced in January 2012 that we intend to sell our Hawaii operations as part of a previously announced strategy to focus on the Mid-Continent and West Coast markets. The assets for sale include the 94 Mbpd Kapolei refinery, 32 retail stations and the associated logistical assets.

Industry Overview

Our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is affected by changes in economic conditions. Product values and crude oil costs are set by the market and are outside of the control of independent refiners.

(Dollars per barrel)

Crude Oil and Product Price Analysis

The U.S. economy continued to grow in 2011, although at a slower pace than in 2010. This slower pace of domestic growth is attributable to a number of factors, including continued high unemployment rates. The nationwide unemployment rate decreased from 9.4% at the end of 2010 to 8.5% at the end of 2011. In California, a key market area for Tesoro, the state's unemployment rate fell by 1.2%, to 11.3%, from December 2010 to November 2011. Global factors include increased geo-political tensions in Libya and the Middle East as well as the effect of heightened European solvency concerns on the already slow-paced recovery from the global 2008 financial collapse.

Developing markets in Asia and Latin America continue to show stronger growth than OECD (the “Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development”) member countries, although their market growth rates tempered toward year end. This strong growth rate combined with refinery issues, primarily in Latin America, have provided an export opportunity for U.S. light products, particularly diesel exports. As of November 2011, net U.S. exports of the three principle light products (gasoline, jet, diesel) exceeded 700 Mbpd. As a result, these historically high exports have provided an outlet for U.S. refining capacity, which has supported margins during this time.

These exports have been led primarily by distillates as the recovery in Asian markets has improved global middle distillate values. Strong Asian refining crack spreads, high demand in Latin America and continued strength in U.S. light product exports provided additional support during the year. During 2011, U.S. West Coast benchmark diesel fuel margins were up nearly 39% from 2010, while U.S. West Coast benchmark gasoline margins fell approximately 18% as compared to 2010. Higher consumer gasoline prices combined with the slow economic recovery continued to keep gasoline demand growth from recovering and continued to weaken gasoline margins.

Table of Contents 

The price differential between Mid-Continent crudes and waterborne crudes increased during the year, contributing to strong refining margins in the Mid-Continent region. The West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) to Brent differential averaged about $16.15 per barrel in 2011, compared to an average of $(0.11) per barrel in 2010. This differential was the result of Mid-Continent crude oil logistics constraints combined with geo-political and global supply issues. The discount of WTI to Brent during the fourth quarter narrowed by $18 per barrel, dropping from $26 per barrel at the end of September 2011 to $8 per barrel at the end of December 2011. This differential has averaged around $12 per barrel during the first quarter of 2012.

Outlook

The slow rate of economic recovery and the accompanying high unemployment continue to hinder the rate of recovery of transportation fuel demand. The growing economies in the developing world are expected to continue to provide positive pressure on distillate margins, though gasoline margins, which are more driven by U.S. consumers, are expected to remain in seasonal ranges. Internationally, recent events, both natural and geopolitical, have created interruptions in the supply chain for oil and other industries, which are causing readjustments in the market place. The lingering effects of the earthquake in Japan during 2011 are continuing to impact low sulfur fuel oil and heavy low sulfur crude oil prices in the Pacific Basin markets. The Libyan oil export disruption in 2011 increased uncertainty related to the supply of crude oil despite increased production by certain OPEC member countries and the release of about 31 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve during the year. More recently, concerns about closure of the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf have increased concerns about crude oil supply from the Middle East. Additionally, the European debt crisis continues to add pressure to financial markets. These international issues continue to impact crude oil and refined product prices and drive concerns about global and regional demand.

In addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the U.S. including:

•world crude oil prices; 

•increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles; 

•increased volumes of renewable fuels, mandated by the Federal Clean Air Act; 

•various regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile sources by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act and by the State of California pursuant to AB32;

•potential enactment of federal climate change legislation; and

•possible promulgation of national regulations relative to gasoline composition and ozone standards under the Federal Clean Air Act.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.

Summary

Our net earnings in 2011 were $546 million ($3.81 per diluted share) compared with a net loss of $29 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in 2010. The increase in net earnings of $4.02 per diluted share was primarily due to the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•considerably higher refining throughput primarily as a result of increased utilization of 87%, and the temporary shut-down of processing at the Washington refinery in 2010; and

•growth in refining and marketing integration from the increased number of retail stations and wholesale supply contracts.

The increase in net earnings during 2011 relative to 2010 was partially offset by the following:

•a $48 million gain recognized in 2010 from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•the receipt of $67 million of business interruption and property insurance recoveries in 2010, compared to the receipt of $37 million of business interruption and property insurance recoveries in 2011, related to the April 2, 2010 incident at our Washington refinery; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our net loss in 2010 was $29 million ($0.21 per diluted share) compared with a net loss of $140 million ($1.01 per diluted share) in 2009. The increase in net earnings of $0.80 per diluted share was primarily due to the following:

•contribution from our capital and non-capital initiative program during 2010 which increased our overall margin through reduced transportation and feedstock costs, increased product margins, and improved refinery yields;

•increased gross refining margins due to local crude discounts and improved distillate margins partially offset by weaker gasoline margins;

•a $48 million gain from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses;

•a $39 million decrease in losses on our derivative instruments;

•improved contribution of $14 million from our retail marketing segment; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in net loss during 2010 relative to 2009 was partially offset by the following:

•lower throughput primarily from the temporary shut-down of processing at our Washington refinery and completion of scheduled refinery turnarounds at several of our other refineries. The gross margin impact of the temporary shut-down at the Washington refinery was partially offset by the receipt of $55 million in business interruption insurance recoveries;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(i)We experienced reduced throughput due to scheduled turnarounds at our Martinez refinery in 2011 and at our Hawaii, North Dakota, Martinez and Utah refineries in 2010. We also temporarily shut-down processing at the Washington refinery beginning in April 2010, and resumed operations at planned rates in November 2010. We experienced reduced throughput due to scheduled turnarounds at our Alaska and Martinez refineries, unscheduled downtime at our Los Angeles refinery and scheduled maintenance at our Washington refinery during 2009.

2011 Compared to 2010

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased by $924 million to $1.2 billion from 2010 to 2011. The increase is primarily due to an improved margin environment, significant crude oil cost advantages and higher refinery throughput during 2011.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased by $2.68 per barrel, or 24%, to $13.94 per barrel in 2011 as compared to 2010, reflecting high industry distillate margins throughout the year. Crude oils that we purchase are primarily priced off of certain crude oil benchmarks such as WTI and Brent. Mid-Continent crude oil logistic constraints continued to elevate the price spread between crude oil priced off WTI as compared to crude oil priced off waterborne crude oil benchmarks throughout most of 2011. This decreased the relative crude oil costs for our Mid-Continent refineries and contributed to strong refining margins for that region. Industry distillate margins on the U.S. West Coast increased approximately 39% during 2011, as exports of distillate and continued economic growth in Asia and Latin America supported demand. Industry gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast declined approximately 18% throughout 2011, as high unemployment rates and elevated retail prices continue to impact demand. The significantly higher gross refining margin per barrel positively impacted consolidated gross refining margins by $970 million in 2011 as compared to 2010.

We use non-trading derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products. We also use non-trading derivative instruments to manage price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels. Gains or losses associated with our derivative instruments are included in gross refining margin. Our losses totaled $6 million during 2011 and $29 million during 2010. 

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 99 Mbpd, or 21%, to 579 Mbpd in 2011 as compared to 480 Mbpd in 2010 primarily due to our Washington refinery being fully operational for the full year in 2011, as compared to 2010 when we temporarily shut-down processing at our Washington refinery subsequent to the April 2010 incident. Additionally, our throughputs were higher in 2011 because of favorable market conditions, improved reliability and turnarounds at our Martinez, Hawaii, Utah and North Dakota refineries in 2010. 

Refined Products Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $10 billion, or 53% to $29 billion in 2011 as compared to $19 billion in 2010, primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price increased $30.06 per barrel, or 33%, to $121.09 per barrel in 2011 as compared to $91.03 per barrel in 2010, as higher crude oil prices put upward pressure on product prices. Total refined product sales increased by 88 Mbpd, or 15%, to 660 Mbpd in 2011 as compared to 572 Mbpd in 2010. Refined product sales volumes were impacted by increased demand for diesel fuel and gasoline and additional branded marketing supply agreements.

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased by $27.30 per barrel, or 33%, to $109.96 per barrel in 2011 as compared to $82.66 per barrel in 2010, reflecting higher crude oil prices impacted by global market events discussed in “Business Strategy and Overview.” Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $17 million, or 1%, to $1.3 billion in 2011 as a result of higher energy costs due to significant increases in throughput volumes. We recorded $67 million of business interruption insurance and property insurance recoveries during 2010, as compared to only $37 million in 2011, related to the 2010 Washington refinery incident which reduced cost of sales and operating expenses. Additionally, the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits resulted in a $32 million gain in 2010. 

Loss on Asset Disposals and Impairments. Loss on asset disposals increased by $12 million, or 25%, primarily due to a change in scope of a capital project at our Los Angeles refinery. The change resulted in a $51 million loss related to this project in 2011, as compared to a $20 million loss in 2010. The increase was partially offset by a goodwill write-off of $10 million recorded in 2010 related to our Hawaii refinery. The book value of our Hawaii refinery increased as a result of our 2010 turnaround while the estimated fair value decreased based on estimated future cash flows.

2010 Compared to 2009

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased by $200 million, to $255 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase primarily reflects improved total gross refining margins of $191 million during the year. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase of $10 million in manufacturing and other operating expenses.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased by $2.36 per barrel, or 27%, to $11.26 per barrel in 2010 as compared to $8.90 per barrel in 2009, primarily due to significantly higher industry diesel fuel margins and our initiatives to improve our margin capture rates, partially offset by lower industry margins for gasoline. Industry diesel fuel margins in the U.S. West Coast region increased, primarily due to strong exports and increased manufacturing activity nationwide. Industry gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 reflecting poor global demand and higher inventories resulting from high domestic unemployment rates.

During 2010, we reduced our transportation and feedstock costs, realized better refinery yields and improved margins on finished products, which improved consolidated gross margin. Our California refineries benefited from improved product yields and increased throughput of discounted foreign heavy crude oils as these refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils (72% of total refining throughput during 2010). In addition, we experienced higher gross refining margins at our Mid-Continent refineries due to increased use of discounted local crudes and downtime at other refineries in the region.

We use non-trading derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products. We also use non-trading derivative instruments to manage price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels. Gains or losses associated with our derivative instruments are included in gross refining margin. Our losses totaled $29 million during 2010 versus $68 million during 2009. Crude prices increased significantly during 2009 compared to marginal increases during 2010. This pricing difference and lower price volatility improved derivative results during 2010.

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput declined 69 Mbpd, or 13%, to 480 Mbpd during 2010 as compared to 549 Mbpd during 2009 primarily due to the temporary shutdown of processing at the Washington refinery subsequent to the April 2, 2010 incident. Total refining throughput declined during 2010 due to scheduled turnarounds at our Hawaii, North Dakota, Martinez and Utah refineries. Similarly, 2009 throughputs were impacted by scheduled turnarounds at our Alaska and Martinez refineries, scheduled maintenance at our Washington refinery and unscheduled downtime at the Los Angeles refinery.

Refined Products Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $3.3 billion, or 21%, to $19.0 billion in 2010 as compared to $15.7 billion in 2009, primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices, partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price increased $18.86 per barrel, or 26%, to $91.03 per barrel in 2010 as compared to $72.17 in 2009, due to higher average crude oil prices placing upward pressure on product prices. Total refined product sales decreased by 24 Mbpd, or 4%, to 572 Mbpd in 2010 as compared to 596 Mbpd in 2009, primarily reflecting lower product demand.

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average cost of sales increased by $17.73 per barrel, or 27%, to $82.66 per barrel during 2010 as compared to $64.93 during 2009, reflecting higher average crude oil prices partially offset by $55 million in business interruption insurance recoveries recorded as an offset to cost of sales. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $10 million, or 1%, to $1.3 billion in 2010, primarily due to $15 million in charges, net of property insurance recoveries, directly related to the April 2, 2010, incident at the Washington refinery coupled with higher natural gas costs at our California refineries, partially offset by a $32 million gain in operating expenses from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits. 

Loss on Asset Disposals and Impairments. Loss on asset disposals decreased by $23 million, or 32%, primarily due to a decrease in the goodwill write-offs of $33 million, partially offset by an increase in refining equipment impairment charges at our Los Angeles refinery of $8 million. The 2010 goodwill write-off of $10 million was a result of an increase in the net book value of our Hawaii refinery reporting unit and a decrease in its fair value resulting from decreases in estimated future cash flows. The $20 million loss on asset disposals at our Los Angeles refinery in 2010 relates to the deferral of a capital project at our Los Angeles refinery, which resulted in a write-down to fair value of equipment specifically manufactured and uniquely configured for the project.

There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel margin per gallon; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate fuel margin per gallon by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes. Investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance.

(c)Reflects the phased expansion of our branded marketing presence through the addition of approximately 300 wholesale supply contracts, predominantly in the Mid-Continent region during 2011.

2011 Compared to 2010

Operating Income. Operating income for our retail segment decreased $8 million, or 8%, to $89 million in 2011 as compared to $97 million in 2010. Total gross margin decreased $6 million, or 2% to $352 million in 2011 compared to $358 million in 2010. Retail fuel margin per gallon decreased 14% to $0.18 per gallon in 2011 leading fuel gross margins to decrease $5 million from 2010. During 2011, rapidly rising wholesale fuel costs outpaced increases in retail street prices, which negatively impacted operating income and retail margins. This was partially offset by a 190 million gallon, or 14%, increase in fuel sales volumes in 2011 as compared to 2010 led by the addition of branded marketing supply contracts in the Mid-Continent region, which were added in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margin remained stable at $78 million during 2011 compared to $79 million in 2010.

Fuel sales revenues increased $1.5 billion, or 42%, to $5.1 billion in 2011 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2010, reflecting significantly higher average sales prices and increased fuel sales volumes. Costs of sales increased from 2010 due to higher prices for purchased fuel. Our other expenses remained relatively consistent compared to 2010.

2010 Compared to 2009

Operating Income. Our retail segment operating income increased $14 million, or 17% to $97 million during 2010 as compared to $83 million during 2009 due to increased fuel sale volumes and lower expenses. Fuel gross margins increased $6 million as retail fuel margin remained consistent at $0.21 per gallon with an increase in fuel sales volume of 7 million gallons. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margins also had a slight increase of $2 million resulting from higher average 2010 retail station counts. As a result, total gross margins increased $8 million, or 2%, to $358 million in 2010 as compared to $350 million in 2009.

Fuel sale revenues increased $583 million, or 19%, to $3.6 billion in 2010 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2009, reflecting significantly higher average sales prices and a minor increase in fuel sales volumes. Cost of sales increased from 2009 due to higher prices for purchased fuel. Our other expenses, excluding the loss on asset disposals and impairments, decreased by $9 million, or 3%, to $255 million during 2010 as compared to $264 million during 2009 primarily due to cost savings from the elimination of postretirement life insurance for current and future retirees of $4 million.

Consolidated Results of Operations

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5 million, or 2%, to $237 million in 2011 from $242 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense recorded for our restricted common stock and executive phantom stock options, which decreased by $5 million and $6 million, respectively. All of the remaining outstanding executive phantom stock options, which are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, were exercised during 2011. Additionally, restricted common stock expense, which is recognized over the vesting period, decreased due to a significant reduction in the number of awards outstanding during the period as a result of vestings and forfeitures. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $21 million or 10% to $242 million in 2010 from $221 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher stock prices on stock-based compensation expense recorded for our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock options, which increased by $15 million and $4 million, respectively. Our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock options are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period. In addition, incentive compensation costs increased by $13 million during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in 2010 was partially offset by a $15 million gain recognized on the elimination of the postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees. 

Interest and Financing Costs. Interest and financing costs increased $20 million, or 13%, to $177 million in 2011 from $157 million in 2010. The increase reflects a $13 million charge to write-off the unamortized discount on the Junior Subordinated Notes, which were redeemed during 2011, a $9 million charge related to premiums paid associated with the repurchase of our 6 1/4% Notes and 6 1/2% Notes, and interest on borrowings outstanding under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility, which was entered into in October 2010. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from a reduction in outstanding long-term debt.

Interest and financing cost increased $27 million or 21% to $157 million in 2010 from $130 million in 2009 primarily due to additional interest expense recognized in 2010 as a result of the issuance of our $300 million senior notes in June 2009 and due to increases in our letter of credit fees resulting from the February 2010 amendment to the Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense was $342 million in 2011 compared to an expense of $4 million in 2010 and a benefit of $48 million in 2009. The combined federal and state effective income tax rates were 38%, (16)%, and 26% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $4 million of tax expense in 2010 included a $7 million charge related to health care legislation enacted in 2010. The 2009 tax benefit was reduced by $17 million relating to a goodwill write-off for which there was no corresponding tax basis.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 32 for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit facilities and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.

Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit. We ended 2011 with $900 million of cash and cash equivalents, no borrowings under the Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility, $117 million in borrowings under the Tesoro Panama S.A. ("TPSA") Revolving Credit Facility and $50 million in borrowings under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements. We remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet, and anticipate retiring the remaining $299 million 6 1/4% Senior Notes in 2012, which will give us greater flexibility to drive future growth. We had borrowing availability under our credit agreements as follows at December 31, 2011 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(a)Borrowing base is the lesser of the amount of the periodically adjusted borrowing base or the agreement’s total capacity.

Our credit facilities as of December 31, 2011, were subject to the following expenses and fees.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(b)We have the option to elect if the borrowings will bear interest at either a base rate plus the base rate margin, or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable period, plus, the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing.

Credit Facilities

Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolving Credit Facility")

We amended our Revolving Credit Facility in March 2011, adjusting the total available capacity to $1.85 billion. The total capacity can be further increased up to an aggregate of $2.25 billion, subject to receiving increased commitments. Additionally, there were reductions in borrowing rates and the easing of certain covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoro's active domestic subsidiaries, excluding TLGP and TLLP and its subsidiaries, and is secured by substantially all of the crude oil and refined product inventories, cash and receivables of Tesoro's active domestic subsidiaries.

Table of Contents 

Our Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes impose various restrictions and covenants that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity capital, pay cash dividends, or repurchase our common stock. The indentures for our senior notes contain covenants and restrictions, which are customary for notes of this nature. These covenants and restrictions limit, among other things, our ability to:

•pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase, redeem or retire our capital stock;

•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;

•sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business;

•incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•engage in certain business activities;

•make certain payments and distributions from our subsidiaries;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into transactions with affiliates.

Borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, we have a default covenant, which requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of and for the year December 31, 2011. 

At December 31, 2011, our Revolving Credit Facility provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base of approximately $3.2 billion, consisting of Tesoro’s eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories (based upon a West Texas Intermediate crude oil price of $100 per barrel), net of the standard reserve as defined, or the Revolving Credit Facility’s total capacity of $1.85 billion. At December 31, 2011, we had unused credit availability of approximately 44% of the eligible borrowing base. Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate.

Our committed Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on March 16, 2016. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate if the Company does not (a) refinance or pay in full, the Company's 6 1/4% notes due November 2012 on or prior to the stated maturity date, or (b) refinance or pay in full, the Company's 6 5/8% notes due November 2015 on or prior to the stated maturity date.

Letter of Credit Agreements

The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit agreements for foreign crude oil purchases. In August 2011, we added an additional facility, which increased the number of agreements from three to four. At December 31, 2011, the four separate uncommitted letter of credit agreements had $398 million outstanding. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the petroleum inventories for which they are issued. Capacity under these letter of credit agreements is available on an uncommitted basis, and can be terminated by either party, at any time.

TPSA Revolving Credit Facility

As part of our business strategy, we formed TPSA, a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Tesoro, to further utilize our leased pipeline and tank facilities in Panama. TPSA entered into a 364-day uncommitted, secured revolving credit agreement in October 2010. We amended and restated, in substantially the same form, the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility for an additional 364-day term in October 2011. TPSA is an unrestricted subsidiary under our outstanding indentures. The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro and is guaranteed by TPSA's assets. The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility includes two uncommitted facilities, which provide for revolving borrowings, swing line loans, daylight overdraft loans and letters of credit. 

We increased the maximum capacity of these facilities from $350 million to $500 million, consisting of $350 million under the first facility and $150 million under the second facility, and amended this facility to modify certain terms of the collateral pool calculation in June 2011. The two facilities maximum capacities were increased from $245 million and $105 million, respectively. Our total capacity under the TPSA facilities can be further increased up to $700 million provided the facilities' maximum amounts do not exceed $550 million and $350 million, respectively.

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2011, our TPSA Revolving Credit Facility provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base consisting of TPSA eligible receivables and petroleum inventories, net of reserves, or the agreement's capacity based on the net worth of TPSA. We had $117 million in borrowings outstanding under this agreement and letters of credit outstanding of $169 million at December 31, 2011. We reduced our borrowings under this facility by $33 million in 2011.

The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility contains certain default covenants and conditions relative to TPSA's financial results that, among other things, limit TPSA's ability to incur indebtedness or carry inventory levels above certain defined maximums. TPSA is also required to maintain specified levels of adjusted tangible net worth (as defined), and adjusted net working capital (as defined). We were in compliance with all TPSA Revolving Credit Facility covenants and conditions as of December 31, 2011. Letters of credit outstanding under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the base rate margin.

TLLP Revolving Credit Facility

On April 26, 2011, TLLP entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility provides for total available revolving capacity of $150 million and allows for TLLP to request that the capacity be increased up to an aggregate of $300 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. TLLP borrowed $50 million under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Offering. 

The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP (which is TLLP's general partner), and is guaranteed by all of TLLP's subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of its assets. Borrowings available under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility are up to the total available revolving capacity of the facility. Letters of credit outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on April 25, 2014. In 2012, the Partnership expects to expand the total capacity under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility to $300 million, with the ability to further increase the capacity up to an aggregate of $450 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders.

The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict TLLP's ability (as well as those of TLLP's subsidiaries) to:

•incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•pay and make certain restricted payments; 

•make distributions from its subsidiaries;

•dispose of assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in its business;

•make certain amendments, modifications or supplements to organization documents and material contracts;

•engage in certain business activities;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into transactions with affiliates.

Additionally, covenants require TLLP to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. We were in compliance with all TLLP Revolving Credit Facility covenants and conditions as of December 31, 2011.

Capitalization

Our capital structure at December 31, 2011 was comprised of (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2011, our debt to capitalization ratio had decreased to 30% compared to 38% at year-end 2010, reflecting earnings during 2011 and a reduction in outstanding borrowings of $150 million related to the Junior Subordinated Notes, $151 million from the repurchase of the 6 1/4% Senior Notes, $27 million from the repurchase of the 6 1/2% Senior Notes and $33 million of repayments on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in borrowings of

 $50 million related to our TLLP Revolving Credit Facility.

From time to time, we may purchase our Senior Notes in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend on available cash, market conditions and other considerations.

6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2017

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased $27 million of these notes through the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $28 million, including accrued interest and premiums. 

6 1/4% Senior Notes due 2012

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased $151 million of these notes through the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $161 million, including accrued interest and premiums. We expect to retire the remaining $299 million on or before maturity.

Junior Subordinated Notes due 2012

We redeemed the $150 million Junior Subordinated Notes due 2012 in May 2011. Upon redemption, we recorded a $13 million charge to write-off the remaining unamortized discount associated with these notes, which is included in interest and financing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. 

Anti-dilutive Share Purchase Program

In August 2011, our Board of Directors approved a program designed to offset the dilutive effect of 2011 and future stock-based compensation awards. The Board authorized the purchase of approximately 0.7 million shares related to 2011 awards granted to offset their potential dilutive effect. The Board also authorized a program to purchase additional shares in subsequent years to offset the dilutive effect of future stock-based compensation programs. In September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock intended to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued for stock-based compensation awards granted in fiscal years prior to 2011. In total, we purchased the 4.7 million authorized shares of common stock in 2011 for $95 million pursuant to the Board's approval. Under this plan, we intend to purchase additional shares in 2012 to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation granted in 2012.

Cash Dividends

We did not pay any cash dividends during 2011 and 2010. During 2009, we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $0.35 per share.

Cash Flow Summary

Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2011 Compared to 2010

Net cash from operating activities increased $304 million, or 79%, to $689 million in 2011 as compared to $385 million in 2010 primarily due to higher cash earnings. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4 million, or 1% to $291 million in 2011 as compared to $295 million in 2010 due to a decrease in cash outflows for capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities decreased $291 million from $145 million in 2010 to $(146) million in 2011. In 2011, net cash outflows from financing activities include debt repurchases of $328 million, stock purchases of $95 million and $37 million in financing costs and other that is primarily related to premiums paid on the debt repurchases. These outflows were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common units related to TLLP of $288 million and net borrowings under revolving credit agreements of $17 million. In 2010, net cash inflows from financing activities is primarily related to net borrowings under revolving credit agreements of $150 million.

Working capital requirements (excluding cash) increased $218 million in 2011, primarily related to significant increases in crude oil and product prices, which impact inventory values, related payables and trade receivables. Additionally, refining feedstock inventories increased by approximately 18% from December 31, 2010, which are partially offset by net repayments of $33 million of short-term borrowings on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility, and an increase in current maturities of short term debt related to the 6 1/4% Senior Notes, which are scheduled to mature within the next twelve months. 

2010 Compared to 2009

Net cash from operating activities decreased $278 million, or 42%, to $385 million in 2010 as compared to $663 million in 2009 primarily due to higher working capital requirements partially offset by a decrease in net losses for the period. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $141 million, or 32% to $295 million in 2010 as compared to $436 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities decreased $21 million or 13% to $145 million in 2010 from $166 million in 2009 primarily due to $150 million in net borrowings under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility in 2010 offset by net proceeds on our senior note issuance of $282 million, net repayments on our revolver of $66 million and dividend payments of $49 million in 2009.

Working capital (excluding cash) was a source of $137 million in cash for the year ending December 31, 2010, primarily related to a run-up in crude and product prices towards the end of the year. Inventories increased by approximately seven million barrels from December 31, 2009. This was offset by corresponding increases in accounts payable and current maturities of long-term debt in the statement of consolidated cash flows.

Capital Expenditures

The cost estimates for capital expenditures, including environmental projects, described below are subject to further review and analysis and permitting requirements, and exclude estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs. Our 2012 expected capital spending is $670 million, which includes the following projects: 

Los Angeles Refinery. We intend to replace the vacuum distillation unit at our Los Angeles refinery. The capital investment

for the unit upgrade is expected to be approximately $40 million, of which, approximately $34 million is expected to be spent in 2012. The project is currently scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2012. 

50

Table of Contents 

Martinez Refinery. We intend to make capital improvements to our marine wharf facility. The upgraded facility will allow us to increase our ability to move products from our refinery, thus supporting higher utilization of our refining assets. The project cost is approximately $100 million, of which we expect to spend approximately $5 million during 2012. The project is expected to be completed in 2015.

North Dakota Refinery. We expect to complete a capital project to expand the crude oil throughput capacity of the Mandan,

North Dakota refinery from 58 Mbpd to 68 Mbpd in the second quarter of 2012. The current expected capital investment for the expansion, is expected to be approximately $35 million, of which we expect to spend $32 million in 2012. The expansion will allow the refinery to process additional crude from the nearby Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area delivered via the TLLP High Plains System. We also intend to expand the diesel desulfurization unit from 17 Mbpd to 22 Mbpd in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect to spend approximately $35 million to complete this project, of which, $10 million is expected to be spent in 2012.

Washington Refinery. We have planned capital expenditures for an unloading facility at the Washington refinery to accommodate a unit train. This facility will allow the supply of crude oil from the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin region in North Dakota to our Washington refinery. The construction of the facility is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to spend approximately $55 million on this project, of which $54 million is expected to be spent in 2012. 

Utah Refinery. We intend to make capital improvements to our Salt Lake City, Utah refinery. This conversion project is designed to improve yields of gasoline and diesel, improve the flexibility of processing crude feedstocks, and increase throughput capacity by 4 Mbpd. The estimated capital expenditure is approximately $180 million, of which we expect to spend approximately $60 million during 2012. The conversion project is expected to be completed in two stages in 2013 and 2014.

Retail. We expect to spend approximately $30 million to rebrand approximately 240 leased retail stations in southern California, which are expected to be phased in during 2012 and 2014. We expect to spend $22 million related to the rebranding of these stations in 2012.

Our capital spending during 2011 was $320 million compared to our 2011 capital budget of $380 million. The capital spending plans for 2012 reflect the Company’s emphasis on long term strategic priorities including continued focus on safety and reliability and greater focus on value-driven growth. Our 2012 budgeted and 2011 actual capital spending amounts are comprised of the following project categories at December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Refinery Turnaround Spending

Our 2012 budget for refinery turnarounds and catalyst is $300 million. The turnaround spending is primarily at our Martinez, Los Angeles, Hawaii and Alaska refineries. Refining throughput and yields in 2012 will be affected by these turnarounds. During 2011, we spent $109 million for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, primarily at our California refineries.

Environmental Capital Expenditures

The EPA issued regulations in February 2007 that require the reduction of benzene in gasoline. We spent $54 million in 2011, and plan to spend an additional $9 million through 2012 at our Alaska, Hawaii and Utah refineries to comply with the regulations. Our California refineries do not require capital spending to meet the benzene reduction standards.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than our leasing arrangements described in Note P to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

Environmental and Other Matters

We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.

We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls, or make other modifications to certain emission sources, equipment or facilities.

Future expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our refineries, tank farms, pipelines, operating retail stations, closed retail stations, operating refined-products terminals and closed refined products terminals. The impact of these legislative and regulatory developments, including any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program or low carbon fuel standards, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In 2009, the EPA proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The first of these regulations, finalized on April 1, 2010, sets standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars. It could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels. In addition, other finalized regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold. The resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries. We cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

In December 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that created a second Renewable Fuels Standard (“RFS2”). This standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 15.2 billion gallons in 2012 and to increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture. In the near term, the RFS2 presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol, alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries. We are currently meeting the RFS2 requirements through a combination of blending renewable fuels and purchases of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) in the open market. Additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels. We cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

In California, Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”), created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to 1990 emissions levels by 2020. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and a low carbon fuel standard (“LCFS”) to achieve emissions reduction targets. Although a court ruled the LCFS unconstitutional in January 2012, the California Air Resources Board has appealed the decision. The LCFS became effective in January 2010 and would have required a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. Final regulations for all other aspects of AB 32, including cap-and-trade requirements, are being developed by the California Air Resources Board. These regulations should take effect in 2012 and are to be fully implemented by 2020. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the court's ruling on the LCFS and the implementation and implications of AB 32 will take many years to realize. Consequently, we cannot currently predict AB32's impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result in increased expenditures in the future. We are also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities. We believe that resolution of any such claim(s) would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.

Environmental Liabilities

We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments, and it is possible that our projections will change and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available. 

At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled $93 million and $108 million, respectively. Of this amount $55 million and $62 million, respectively, relate to environmental liabilities for site clean-up activities assumed from a prior owner, arising from operations at our Martinez refinery prior to August 2000. Certain projects at the Martinez refinery are subject to a cost-share agreement where we are responsible for 75% of the expenditures. Approximately $46 million of our obligations are related to this agreement. We cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the Martinez refinery. Therefore, it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and remediation costs as more information becomes available. We have filed insurance claims under environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of $50 million in self-insurance, but the insurer has challenged coverage and filed a declaratory relief action in federal court. We have not recognized possible insurance recoveries related to this matter. 

We have investigated conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Martinez Refinery. The investigation was driven by an order received in 2004 from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The order named us as well as two previous owners of the Martinez Refinery. We cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order, but we believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Washington Refinery Fire

In April 2010, the naphtha hydrotreater unit at our Washington refinery was involved in a fire, which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable. Subsequent to the incident, refinery processing was temporarily shut down until the unit reconstruction was completed. The Washington refinery resumed operations at planned rates in November 2010.

In February 2011, Tesoro Corporation, Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company and other defendants were named in a lawsuit brought by the estates and families of the seven fatally injured employees arising from the April 2010 incident at our Washington refinery. In addition, a third-party truck driver has alleged damages in the lawsuit. The lawsuit includes allegations of negligence, premises liability, strict liability, product liability and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. This case, Donald and Peggy Zimmerman et al. v. Tesoro Corporation and Tesoro Refining and Marketing et al., is proceeding in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, Skagit County. The Company believes that it has defenses to the allegations contained in the lawsuit. While we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of this matter, and currently believe that the outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, the ultimate resolution could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations.

We maintain comprehensive property (including business interruption), workers' compensation, and general liability insurance policies with significant loss limits. Our business interruption insurance deductible is satisfied after we have exceeded both 60 days of operational disruption and $25 million in losses primarily based on the operating plan that existed prior to the incident. Our property damage insurance has a $10 million deductible. 

We have filed business interruption insurance claims and property damage claims related to this incident. We collected $87 million in business interruption insurance recoveries that relate to downtime from the incident, which were recorded as an offset to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. Of the $87 million collected, $32 million was recorded in 2011 and $55 million was recorded in 2010. We received $17 million to settle the property damage claim filed for this incident, which was recorded as a reduction to operating expense. Of the $17 million, $5 million was recorded in 2011 and $12 million was recorded in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, all property damage claims have been settled but certain business interruption claims remain open.

Other Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have not established accruals for these matters unless a loss is probable and the amount of loss is currently estimable. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In October 2011, MF Global Holding Ltd. (“MF Global”), a broker-dealer we used for derivatives transactions, announced filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York. We ceased doing business with MF Global and liquidated all accounts during 2011. As of December 31, 2011, however, we had cash collateral remaining with them of approximately $24 million. We cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of this matter.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Financial Reform Act of 2010, was signed into law. Key provisions of the act require that standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements. These requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting, capital, and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities. Final rules implementing this statute were approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on October 19, 2011, and are expected to be effective in mid-2012, subject to potential legal challenge. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these rules, and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, the final rules may result in increased hedging costs and cash collateral requirements, which could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. 

Legal

We are a defendant, along with other manufacturing, supply and marketing defendants, in five remaining lawsuits, as one was settled in 2011, alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. The defendants are being sued for having manufactured MTBE and having manufactured, supplied and distributed gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs in the five cases, all in California, are municipalities and governmental authorities. The plaintiffs allege, in part, that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees. We intend to vigorously assert our defenses against these claims. In December 2011, we reached agreement to settle two of the remaining five lawsuits pending a court's approval of the settlement. While we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of the remaining matters, we have established an accrual for this matter and believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

During 2009, Chevron filed a lawsuit against us claiming they are entitled to a share of the refunds we received in 2008 from the owners of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (“TAPS”). We received $50 million in 2008, net of contingent legal fees, for excessive intrastate rates charged by TAPS during 1997 through 2000, and the period of 2001 through June 2003. Chevron is asserting that it is entitled to a share of its portion of the refunds for retroactive price adjustments under our previous crude oil contracts with them. The trial court judge granted Chevron's motion for summary judgment and awarded them $16 million, including interest, in September 2010. We disagree with the trial court and have appealed the decision to the Alaska Supreme Court in which the proceeding is now pending. We have established an accrual for this matter and believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Environmental

In December 2011, we agreed to settle a lawsuit filed on February 5, 2010 by the EPA alleging we violated the Clean Air Act and corresponding regulatory requirements concerning the testing and reporting of transportation fuels and fuel additives. We received a notice of violation (“NOV”) from the EPA in February 2009, for the alleged violations arising from a compliance review conducted by the EPA in 2006 for the years 2003 through the time of the review in 2006. We have agreed to pay $965,000 and take certain actions, including developing protocols for collecting samples from and mixing refined products in storage tanks, to settle this matter pending execution of the settlement agreement. We have established an accrual for this matter and believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The EPA has alleged that we have violated the Clean Air Act, regulations under the Clean Air Act and/or Clean Air Act permits at our Alaska, Washington, Martinez, Hawaii and Utah refineries. We are continuing discussions of the EPA's claims with the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). We previously received a NOV in March 2011, from the EPA alleging violations of Title V of the Clean Air Act at our Alaska refinery. The alleged violations in the NOV arise from a 2007 state of Alaska inspection and inspections by the EPA in 2008 and 2010. We also previously received NOV's in 2005 and 2008 alleging violations of the Clean Air Act at our Washington refinery. We are evaluating all of these allegations. The ultimate resolution of these matters could require us to incur material capital expenditures and/or civil penalties. While we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of these matters, and currently believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, the ultimate resolution could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations.

Long-Term Commitments

Contractual Commitments

We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes L and P to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to TLLP under our various fee-based commercial agreements as these related-party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(a)Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings.

(b)Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)Represents primarily long-term commitments for the transportation of crude oil and refined products as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contract’s minimum volume requirements.

(e)Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.

We also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Note O, Note P and Note M, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits, with the exception of amounts classified as current, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded from the table $12 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $8 million at December 31, 2011. See Note N to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Pension Funding

We provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees, with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 7.25% as of December 31, 2011, and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a return of $28 million in 2011 and a return of $30 million in 2010. Based on a 4.86% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2011, the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 54% of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of 2011. At January 1, 2011 the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations) was 80%. Tesoro contributed $48 million

during 2011, a portion of which was in excess of the minimum required. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, discount rates, employee demographics, regulatory environments and other factors. See Note O to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note A to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Receivables — Our trade receivables are stated at their invoiced amounts, less an allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts. We monitor the credit and payment experience of our customers and manage our loss exposure through our credit policies and procedures. The estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our general loss experience and identified loss exposures on individual accounts. Actual losses could vary from estimates as global economic conditions and the related credit environment could change.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles — We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental requirements could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. 

We evaluate these assets for potential impairment when an asset disposition is probable or when there are indicators of impairment (for example, current period operating losses combined with a history of operating losses or a temporary shutdown of a refinery) and, if so, assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset’s net book value exceeds its fair market value. Fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. At December 31, 2011, we evaluated certain of our refineries for potential impairment and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary.

Goodwill — As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a goodwill balance of $36 million. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist for the underlying assets. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. An impairment charge would be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value.

We review the recorded value of our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. We evaluated goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2010, using an income approach based on the present value of expected net cash flows and a market approach based on recent sales transactions and current stock prices. Decreased forecasted cash flows and quoted market prices reduced our estimated fair value below carrying value at certain of our refining reporting units resulting in a goodwill write-off of $10 million in 2010. 

We early adopted the accounting guidance issued in September 2011 that simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. Our goodwill testing in 2011 involved a qualitative approach as prescribed under the new standard. As part of our qualitative assessments, we considered economic conditions, increased unemployment, and the impact of the European debt crisis. We evaluated industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity specific and reporting unit events. We assessed our overall financial performance and considered other factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products including: crude oil prices, increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles, or other legislation that could have negative implications. We determined the relevance of any entity-specific events or events affecting our reporting units which would have a negative effect on the carrying value of the reporting units. The qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicated that the more-likely-than-not threshold that the fair value of our reporting units is less than its carrying amounts has not been achieved. Accordingly, no additional quantitative testing was performed and no goodwill impairment charges were recognized in 2011.

Environmental Liabilities — At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our total environmental liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities were $93 million and $108 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties. 

Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. We do not discount our estimated liabilities to present value.

Legal Liabilities — In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, and governmental investigations. These matters may involve large or unspecified damages or penalties that may be sought from us and may require years to resolve. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The liability is recorded for an amount that is management’s best estimate of the loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss amount of a range of possible outcomes. Significant judgment is required in estimating such liabilities, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results.

Income Taxes — As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. We must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $9 million on certain state credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2011, based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. We may need to establish an additional valuation allowance if actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods. 

We also recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that are not recognized that we have taken or expect to take, are generally recorded as liabilities. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties totaled $20 million and $33 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations — Our asset retirement obligations totaled $26 million and $30 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record asset retirement obligations in the period in which we have a legal obligation to incur this liability and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. When the liability is initially recorded, the cost is capitalized by increasing the book value of the related long-lived tangible asset. The liability is accreted through operating expenses to its estimated settlement value and the related capitalized cost is depreciated over the asset's useful life.

We use the present value of expected cash flows using third-party estimates or historical data to estimate fair value. The calculation of fair value is based on several estimates and assumptions, including inflation, a discount rate, the settlement dates or a range of potential settlement dates and the probabilities associated with settlement. We consider our past practice, industry practice, management’s intent and estimated economic lives to estimate settlement dates. Our estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the retirement and technological improvements associated with the retirement activities. 

We cannot currently make reasonable estimates of the fair values of some retirement obligations, principally those associated with our refineries, pipelines and certain terminals and retail stations, because the related assets have indeterminate useful lives which preclude development of assumptions about the potential timing of settlement dates. Such obligations will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits — Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status or a liability if the plans are underfunded. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans assets and its projected benefit obligations. While we believe the assumptions we used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to the effective yields on high quality corporate bonds that have a comparable cash flow pattern to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the funded qualified employee retirement plan would have had the following effects in 2011 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note O to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.

Stock-Based Compensation — We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and certain other stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions including the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term, and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as outlined above; however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and impact of the possible differing stock price paths. Changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock-based awards. The fair values of our stock appreciation rights, phantom stock options and performance units are estimated at the end of each reporting period and are recorded as liabilities. Changes in our assumptions may impact our liabilities and expenses associated with our stock-based awards.

New Accounting Standards and Disclosures

Goodwill Impairment Testing

The FASB issued an ASU in September 2011 related to testing goodwill for impairment. This ASU provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The Company can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. Further, the ASU allows the Company to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. However, an entity can choose to early adopt the standard, provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements. We elected to early adopt this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2011. The early adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

The FASB issued an ASU in June 2011, regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. This ASU eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity. Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both cases, the entity is required to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where those components are presented. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. However, in October 2011, the FASB announced it would defer the effective date of the requirement to present reclassifications from OCI to net income on the face of the financial statements. It does not change the requirement to present net income, components of OCI, and total comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. We early adopted this standard in 2011, and have presented components of other comprehensive income in two consecutive statements. We do not believe the adoption of the remainder of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

The FASB issued an ASU in May 2011 related to fair value measurements and disclosures to achieve common fair value measurements and additional consistency of disclosures between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This standard includes amendments that clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosure requirements, while other amendments change a principle or requirement for fair value measurements or disclosures. Some of the changes include (1) the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, (2) measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity, and (3) quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, this standard requires additional disclosure for level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
