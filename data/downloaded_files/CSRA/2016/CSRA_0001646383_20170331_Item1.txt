PART I

Item 1. Business 

Overview

CSRA is a leading pure-play provider of information technology (“IT”) services to the U.S. government. We seek to deliver tailored, innovative, and efficient offerings to our customers; scale to our strategic partners; and targeted skills development and career opportunities to our employees. As of March 31, 2017, we have approximately 18,500 employees executing more than 1,000 projects. 

We work with our customers to understand their complex environments and are committed to supporting their missions. Our skilled personnel, expanding capabilities, and competitive cost structure contribute to our track record of delivering high-quality solutions and services on schedule and within budget. We believe our focus on innovation and a culture of efficiency make us competitive in our marketplace.

Our business operates through two balanced segments that cover the breadth of U.S. federal agencies and selected state and local governments. We combine our technical expertise in applications and IT infrastructure solutions with our deep public sector mission knowledge and experience to differentiate our services. We engage with our customers’ most senior personnel to lead change in their organizations.

We believe we are well positioned to lead our public sector customers into the digital future as they increasingly move to “as a service” delivery. In addition, we believe that the breadth of our contracts, our demonstrated expertise in IT, our strong partnerships with key providers across the U.S. government and our commercial heritage provide us with a competitive advantage. For instance, as part of our overall strategy, we go to market with vendor partners and comprehensive capabilities that are embedded in our service areas and alliance program. In addition, we treat every expense as an investment to support our competitive cost structure while simultaneously adopting next generation IT (“Next Gen”) for our own use and for delivery to our customers. Finally, we continue to take advantage of advances in IT to move work to lower-cost centers. Our Integrated Technology Center (“ITC”) in Bossier City, Louisiana is an important part of our strategy to deliver cost-effective solutions and services by leveraging a lower-cost labor market, economies of scale and strategic relationships with the State of Louisiana and its technology-focused academic institutions.

History and Development

CSRA’s business has been focused on the public sector for more than 50 years, tracing back to the first government contract awarded in 1961 to our former parent, CSC. CSRA Inc., formerly known as Computer Sciences Government Services Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on June 16, 2015, in anticipation of the Spin-Off. On November 27, 2015, CSRA became an independent public company through consummation of the Spin-Off. On November 30, 2015, CSRA completed its combination with SRA and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CSRA.” CSRA operates as a fully integrated company via its primary operating subsidiaries, CSRA LLC and SRA International, Inc.

Corporate Identity

Our corporate identity is comprised of four elements-mission, values, vision, and strategy. The foundations are mission, which is our statement of why we exist, and values, which are the fundamental beliefs that guide how we engage with our customers and other stakeholders every day. The mission and values drive the vision, or who we want to be to each of our stakeholders, and the strategy, which is our competitive game plan. The mission and values are the more enduring elements, and the vision and the strategy will vary in response to changing market conditions. Looking from another perspective, the mission and vision are the goals we are setting for ourselves; the strategy and the values are our approach to accomplishing those goals. Our mission, values, vision, and strategy are then encapsulated by our brand-‘Think Next. Now.’-that provides one message for the entire company to rally behind and enables us to approach the market with a unified purpose and direction. ‘Think Next. Now.’ represents CSRA’s ongoing commitment to the future-to deliver imaginative ideas and flawless execution that are vital to the safety, security, health, and well-being of the nation. We imagine a better future and deliver it today for our customers, our partners, and, ultimately, all of the people our mission touches. The new brand also conveys CSRA’s energetic approach to attracting and cultivating top talent and building brilliant teams that power ingenious ideas for our customers’ missions.

Mission

Our purpose as a company is to solve our nation’s hardest mission problems by serving as the bridge: from our customers’ missions and enterprise IT to these customers’ adoption of Next Gen; from our U.S. government customers to our technology partners; and across different agencies. At CSRA, we have a deep mission expertise that is based in the long-standing relationships we have created with our customers. We have a passion for IT and understand the challenges that companies face when attempting to implement new technologies within government operating environments. We believe these challenges have kept agencies from taking advantage of new technologies and optimizing operations. Based on our knowledge of the government IT market, the customer intimacy we have built over the years and the passion we have for new technologies, we are able to help agencies realize the value of next generation technologies in achieving their missions. 

Values

Our core values of commitment, impact, imagination, agility, and integrity are consistent with our strategy and follow directly from our mission and vision. They will help guide our decision-making and we believe will drive better outcomes for our people and our customers. 

We carefully selected and defined our corporate values to aid in our aspiration of being an employer of choice and creating a culture where the “best ideas win” and may come from anyone at any time within the company. Our values are grounded in our beliefs about what it takes to be the premier partner to our customers in supporting their technology transformations. These values will serve as the foundation for our culture:

•Commitment. We strive to deliver service excellence with a spirit of determination to our customers, partners, employees and their teams, shareholders, and the communities where we live and work;

•Impact. We invest in and develop our people, and strive to provide opportunities to perform meaningful work that leads to valued progress and significant customer results;

•Imagination. We draw upon the best ideas from across CSRA and our partners to power the most ingenious thinking and deliver tomorrow’s opportunities today;

•Integrity. We aspire always to principled leadership and decision-making and forthright communication. We set high standards to operate honestly and ethically. We treat one another with respect and compassion and are accountable for our actions; and

•Agility. We anticipate change and initiate it when our customers’ missions demand it; we are agile at scale and can mobilize the enterprise to adapt as the landscape evolves.

Our values provide a unifying focus and purpose to our employees. No matter the customer, offering, or work location, we believe our values serve to harmonize our culture and our approach to customer service. In today’s fast-paced, diverse workplace, we believe that our values inform our instincts and represent common standards in an increasingly virtual enterprise. We believe that the uniformity of our values aligns us as partners with our customers and team of teams internally from all layers and levels, and normalizes our interactions with all stakeholders.

Our People

These values are embodied in and motivate our people. Our success as an IT, mission- and operations-oriented services provider is highly dependent on the continued excellent technical capabilities, high standards and ethics and dedication of our personnel. We employ approximately 18,500 people, many of whom are deployed at customer sites throughout the U.S. Our headquarters are located in Falls Church, Virginia, with other major locations in Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington D.C.

We are in the process of building capability for the long term that is closely aligned to our multi-year strategy and Next Gen partnerships. We worked quickly to minimize any disruption arising out of our separation from CSC and the acquisition of SRA. In the past fiscal year, we recruited nearly 5,000 new hires and redeployed over 1,000 internal resources into new opportunities. Although a significant percentage of our employees are new to the company, we take pride in employee retention; 40 percent of our workforce has been with CSRA for more than five years and can share their legacy experience and expertise with newer employees.

Outstanding Talent Community

Our new culture, that we are developing, builds on the strong foundation of our legacy culture, that is rich in mission and IT experience, and is deep in customer knowledge and trust. The majority of our workforce is technical in nature, with over 45 percent of our employees having a bachelor’s degree or higher. Employees’ skills and talents range from entry level technologist to expert level professionals in software design and development, DevOps, network engineering, 

2

systems administration, programmer analyst roles, systems engineering roles, training, logistics, consulting, product development, customer support, scientist roles and Next Gen (including agile, cyber, cloud and mobility). We have thousands of employees doing every aspect of software and data engineering, half of whom are engaged on Agile teams.

We invest heavily in our talent acquisition and staffing capabilities to ensure we are able to find and hire highly qualified candidates. We focus on recruiting excellent talent into the organization, with a key emphasis on our university relations and recruiting strategy, and seek to develop the emerging leaders and technologists of our future. Each year, we typically receive more than 100,000 applications and conduct more than 12,000 interviews. We are confident that we are well positioned to support the employees that we need to support our organic growth goals. We recognize that the market is very competitive for talent, especially resources with government clearances, so we will look to leverage several channels to identify and recruit qualified talent into the company. For example, we expect to partner to hire those service members exiting the military through programs focused on wounded veterans and veterans with disabilities. We have over 4,000 self-identified veterans in our workforce today, approximately one-third of whom self-identified as having a disability.

Talent Development

We focus on continued employee development in four key areas: leadership, technical, program management and business development. We promote an environment of continuous learning with strong educational assistance and certification benefits, along with individual development plans aligned with our growth strategy. 

We offer online and community-based educational opportunities, and our partners offer training in their respective areas. We have seen an increase in new certifications adding over 100 a month in our technical community, leveraging our iLearn platform that offers rich content in technical certification preparation. We aggressively pursue certifications sponsored by our Next Gen partners to maintain our preferred relationships and ready our workforce to deliver transformative, commercial technologies in the areas of cloud, cyber, agile development, mobile and enterprise systems. We regularly hold training programs for our proposal development teams and solution architects. The rapid expansion of our collective talents engaging in business development activities was vital to our success in significantly increasing proposal submittals in the past fiscal year.

Vision

The mission drives our vision- how we want to be perceived by key stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, and shareholders. For our current and potential customers, we aspire to build on our reputation for delivery by introducing innovation to the customers and in the process become their Next Gen thought partner. For our employees, we strive to be the employer of choice committed to developing our people and communities. Our promise to strengthen the community has taken shape through employee resource groups such as CSRA Cares and Future Leaders. For our partners, such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco, Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow, we aim to be the best partner to bring innovation to the government and mission. These partners are all leading technology companies in their respective markets. We believe that the support of our mission experts has enabled them effectively to overcome the operating environment challenges within the public sector. Finally, we aim to reward our shareholders with consistent returns through revenue growth and sustained profitability. 

Strategy

To achieve our vision, our strategy is to drive sustainable, industry-leading internal growth across our federal and state/local markets through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and outcome-based experience. This strategy statement encompasses: (1) where we compete; (2) how we compete; and (3) how we will measure success. 

First, we will focus the U.S. public sector market. We believe the U.S. government and related state and local markets provide many opportunities for us, and we expect that the market dynamics will improve after years of budget cuts. We believe that we are well-positioned to help the U.S. government achieve many of the new U.S. Presidential administration’s priorities, including defense, border security, and care for our veterans.

Second, we will compete through three primary differentiators; customer intimacy, innovation, and outcome-based delivery. Our customer intimacy derives from talented teams who strive to deliver flawlessly, build trust-based relationships and provide mission and technology thought leadership. We strive to deliver rapid innovation through partnerships, shared delivery models and cross-agency capabilities. We believe our customers are looking to move toward paying for outcomes instead of inputs, and we believe that we are an industry leader in delivering outcome-based experience through developing, bidding on and executing shared delivery methodologies.

And third, we are focused on growing the company. We will measure our success primarily through revenue growth, which we expect will help provide better career opportunities for our employees, more solutions that we can provide to our customers, and returns to our shareholders.

Each of these elements is laid out in more detail below. 

Where We Compete: U.S. Public Sector Market 

Industry Overview. We are focused on serving various agencies within the U.S. government, and we maintain a limited presence in state and local programs linked to U.S. government work and projects located in international markets that are contracted, financed, or sponsored by the U.S government. We refer to this generally as the U.S. public sector market.

We have more than 50 years of public sector experience and decades-long relationships with many of our top customers. Due to our focus on servicing various agencies within the U.S. government, we believe that our culture and, in turn, our personnel are focused on helping our customers achieve their respective missions. We believe that the industry offers us the potential for growth based on the following factors:

•Large and fragmented addressable market. We expect the overall amount spent on contracted services will be more than $250 billion during Government Fiscal Year (“GFY”) 2017 (each GFY starts on October 1 and ends on the following September 30). Even excluding large portions of contracted services work for which we do not compete (e.g., base operations), we believe that our business represents about 3 percent of the addressable market, and there are no firms that dominate our market. 

•Increasing demand for Next Gen services. The U.S. government is in the process of transforming its IT infrastructure and software systems. We believe that the capabilities we provide address the priority areas of IT investment for the U.S. government, including cloud, cybersecurity, data analytics, agile-based software development methodologies, and modernization of the U.S. government’s applications with a bias toward Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) and mobile devices. 

•Government-wide mandate to improve efficiency and reduce cost. The new U.S. Presidential administration has identified among its priorities a desire to increase spending for defense, homeland security, cybersecurity, veterans, and infrastructure. We expect that there will be a need to improve efficiency and reduce costs to help fund these priorities, and IT can be an enabler of tremendous cost savings. 

Competitive Landscape. The U.S. public sector market is highly regulated. The U.S. government contract bidding process and performance under these contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”). Contractors with the U.S. government are subject to contract audit oversight, which limits competition by many of our commercial partners. Nevertheless, the industry is highly competitive and we believe favors participants with competitive cost structures. We believe we are well suited to compete, combining demonstrated expertise managing large and complex programs with the agility to pursue smaller orders on a wide range of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts. We believe this flexibility helps reduce our overall portfolio risk during changing market conditions. We provide a breadth of professional IT services to the U.S. government as well as state and local agencies, and we team with, and compete against, companies across this entire competitive landscape:

•Pure-play U.S. government service providers are highly specialized firms that have exceptional mission knowledge, customer intimacy or specific intellectual property that can make them major competitors in the markets that they serve. Some of our competitors in this category include Leidos, Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI, SAIC, Engility, ManTech International Corporation, and ICF International, Inc.

•Large defense contractors are capable of competing across our entire market, and they possess the reputation and ability to compete on large deals with any U.S. government agency and have the financial strength to manage and execute large-scale programs. Some of the large defense contractors we regularly compete with include Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics.

•Diversified consulting, technology and outsourcing service providers are highly regarded and successful with commercial clients, but typically lack the breadth of public sector offerings and presence to compete broadly across the public-sector market. Some of our competitors in this category include subsidiaries of IBM, AT&T, Verizon, DXC Technology, Dell, Accenture and CGI Group.

•Small businesses generally provide services to the U.S. government through requirements and incentive programs designed to create entrepreneurial opportunities for small business owners. In order to support our customers’ use of these small business set-asides, we are implementing a “preferred” small business partner program to team more effectively and compete in this segment of the market.

•Commercial IT vendors have recently emerged as players in the U.S. government market. These vendors include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, Salesforce, ServiceNow and other cloud providers. Though the U.S. government occasionally contracts directly with these vendors, we frequently partner with these companies and incorporate their offerings into our hybrid cloud business model to meet customer mission demands, specific and unique requirements, and our customers’ desire for early adoption of new technology.

How We Compete: Customer Intimacy

We generated approximately 94% and 91% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and April 1, 2016, respectively, from sales to the U.S. government either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we generated approximately 45% and 49%, respectively, of our total revenues from the Department of Defense (“DoD”), including all branches of the U.S. military and intelligence community, and approximately 55% and 51%, respectively, of our total revenues from civilian agencies. We expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from work performed under U.S. government contracts.

During fiscal year 2017 we performed work on approximately 850 contracts, with no single contract accounting for more than 10% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2017. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, our top 12 contracts accounted for approximately 37% of our revenues in each year. For fiscal year 2017, approximately 14% of our revenue was related to classified contracts.

We locate most of our support personnel close to our customers through our two business segments. We seek to grow our business by understanding each customer’s mission and connecting these missions to our broad-based IT capabilities. In order to support our customers, we have developed focused industry teams that provide in-depth knowledge and extensive domain expertise to serve our customers through our two operating segments: Defense and Intelligence; and Civil.

Defense and Intelligence Segment. The DoD is our largest customer in the Defense and Intelligence segment. We provide a broad spectrum of our services and offerings to the DoD. Our industry teams work closely with all branches of the military service and agencies within the DoD to identify requirements for which we can provide our differentiated solutions. Our contracts with the DoD provide for us to support critical warfighter missions by bringing efficiencies, experts, and the latest Next Gen to solve some of our nation’s toughest problems. Our philosophy is to know the customer, know their mission, know their requirements, anticipate their future needs, and to make their priorities our priorities.

Civil Segment. Through our Civil segment, we provide services to numerous federal civil agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and Department of State, as well as to various U.S. federal, state and local health departments. We supply civil government agencies with mission information systems and associated technical support services to agencies with such missions as counterterrorism, environmental protection, and financial markets regulation.

How We Compete: Innovative Solutions

We introduce innovation to our customers through both group- and corporate-led initiatives. In all cases, we leverage the benefits of scale through our corporate Next Gen service areas, alliance partner program, and shared delivery capability. 

•Service Areas. Within our vertically-oriented model, our technologists engage directly with our customer, which enables us to understand and, in turn, meet our customers’ needs. To provide our customers with a high level of technical services, we established a digital consulting organization that provides subject matter experts with technology consulting capabilities across six service areas; Digital Platforms; Digital Services; Data and Analytics; Intelligent Business Processes; Enterprise Business Services; and Cyber. Our service area leaders provide domain leadership in their respective areas of expertise, organize technical communities that create opportunities for mobility and career progression to our technologists, and oversee the creation and management of our key differentiated market capabilities. 

•Partner Program. Our operations, contracts, and relationships allow us to compete, but our success also relies on the technology and expertise of our technology partners. We have built deep technical and marketing relationships with seven large strategic partners-AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and SAP-to co-create offerings and to team more effectively to address our shared pipeline. In addition, we have 28 “Key Alliance” partners and 20 “Emerging Technology” partners. Each of these companies brings a service and skillset that helps us leverage leading technology for the needs of our customers and their missions. Our partner program maintains a special focus on developing relationships with innovative, “born on the cloud” companies that offer differentiated capabilities that enable our customers to achieve their mission objectives more effectively and at lower cost. This ecosystem provides Next Gen innovation to improve our clients’ missions and deliver digital capabilities for America’s warfighters and citizens. We believe that we have enhanced our technical and domain expertise with strategic partnerships that deliver innovative end-to-end solutions, while maintaining our independence to optimize customers’ technology choices. Our services are the bridge that connects the government to technology innovators both large and small.

5

•Shared Delivery. Increasingly, we deliver technical capabilities to multiple customers through our ITC for managed services ranging from network operations to agile development services. We believe this state-of-the-art facility provides significant competitive pricing and technical advantages. We formed partnerships with higher education institutions to create a market leading, robust workforce development program. We collaborated with these institutions to customize curricula that help prepare local graduates for work at CSRA. We also maintain a pro-Veteran workforce development stance, with hiring programs for transitioning military and government employees from nearby Barksdale Air Force Base. As discussed further below, we believe our managed services provide our customers a lower-risk approach to addressing their needs for technology services.

Research and Development. CSRA builds proprietary software solutions that provide unique and compelling value. For example, NetOwl®, a family of leading text and entity analytics software products, uses sophisticated computational linguistics and natural language processing technologies across multiple languages to make advanced Big Data Analysis a reality for unstructured text. We do not have a stand-alone research and development department. In today’s technology market, the innovations from Next Gen technology providers are so rapid and robust that we are able to add value by knowing the customer, acting as their bridge to the technology, and developing solutions for the customer. We then leverage these solutions for multiple customers to drive efficiency.

How We Compete: Outcome-based Experience

We believe we are the industry leader in performing outcome-based work, whereby we deliver many services in a highly repeatable, unit-priced delivery model. This approach is consistent with our focus on IT—particularly large, enterprise-wide programs performed under fixed price service contracts—and our balanced customer portfolio. In our experience, federal civilian customers are often more likely to employ fixed price contracts than defense customers. The ITC is a central component of our strategy to deliver outcomes-based services. In fiscal year 2017, we derived 45% of our revenue from fixed price contracts, which we believe is a level significantly above many of our peers. With our experience in fixed price service contracts, we have built a base of knowledge to deliver innovation with positive outcomes. 

We believe our managed services provide our customers an effective, efficient, and low-risk approach to meeting their IT requirements, and allow them to focus their attention and resources on their missions. Our cost structure, expertise, and flexibility of options enable effective cost management and help our customers maintain IT currency and improve information assurance. Our managed services also enable our agency customers to deploy IT solutions quickly because they can begin consuming services without building an IT infrastructure. Agencies also benefit from our economies of scale and greater transparency and metrics to validate our SLAs and volume. 

Under a typical managed services engagement, we provide IT data center services, including physical servers, storage, and networking; virtual data centers (either on-premises or hosted by a Cloud Service Provider); or other tools that comprise the platform. In addition, we can deliver highly customized managed services, such as data and analytics services, above the Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”) layer. We also provide end-user services, including virtual desktop infrastructure (“VDI”); end-user support services; telephony; unified communications (“UC”); and Microsoft Office 365.

How We Measure Success: Revenue Growth

To increase our revenue growth, we have prioritized our investments in business development, including bid and proposal spending. At the time of the Spin-Off, we set aggressive goals to expand our volume of new business submittals while simultaneously enhancing submittal quality. 

In fiscal year 2017, we submitted approximately $14.0 billion in new contract bids and achieved a new business contract win rate of approximately 35 percent. Our total contract awards in fiscal year 2017 were $6.9 billion, or approximately 1.4 times our revenue. We plan to continue to bid a robust volume of proposals to generate strong revenue growth internally. 

Our backlog as of March 31, 2017 totaled $15.2 billion as compared to $15.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016. Of the total $15.2 billion in backlog, approximately $3.5 billion is expected to be realized as revenue during fiscal year 2018, and $2.4 billion is currently funded. Backlog represents the total estimated contract value of predominantly long-term contracts, based on customer commitments that we believe to be firm, less the amount of revenue already recognized on those contracts. Backlog value is based on contract commitments, management’s judgment and assumptions about volume of services, availability of customer funding and other factors. Our backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements.

6

Ethics and Compliance 

Our ethics and compliance program (“compliance program”) is designed to meet general governance and specific industry and regulatory requirements while maintaining a strategic focus on values, culture, and integrity. We believe that strong risk management processes and effective internal controls-including policies, procedures, training, and audit and monitoring programs-are key components of a well-run, ethical, and compliant organization. Furthermore, we believe our culture and values contribute to the health of our organization, and, accordingly, our executives and the compliance program’s leadership are heavily invested in these areas as well.

Our Code of Business Conduct (“Code”) makes clear that we expect our employees to comply with company policies and the law. Our Code also makes clear that all employees are obligated to report known or suspected misconduct on the part of any other employee. In addition, we forbid retaliatory behavior toward those who make such reports in good faith. We train employees annually on the principles of our compliance program and the contents of our Code, which applies equally to all directors, officers, executives, and employees of CSRA worldwide.

Intellectual Property

Our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, although we do anticipate selectively seeking patent protection. We protect our proprietary intellectual property portfolio, comprising products, technical services, consulting, methodologies, and know-how, using non-disclosure agreements and contractual arrangements, as well as one or more of the following: trade secret, patent, copyright or trademark protections. Some of our proprietary intellectual property contains licensed third-party and open source components. We integrate deep domain knowledge of our clients’ missions with industry leading innovative products and technologies, including open source technologies, to create value for our clients.

For our work under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts, the U.S. government obtains certain rights to data, software and related information that we develop under such contracts or subcontracts. These rights may allow the U.S. government to disclose such data, software and related information to third parties, which may in some instances include competitors. In the case of our work as a subcontractor, our prime contractors may also have certain rights to data, information and products that we develop under the subcontract.

Pursuant to an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement (“IPMA”) with CSC, as amended, we have agreed that we will use intellectual property rights held by us to certain know-how and products as well as intellectual property rights to certain know-how, services, and products held by CSC and licensed to us, in each case, only in connection with certain U.S. federal, state, and local government customers for a period of time. Under certain circumstances, this limitation will be narrowed to apply only to certain commercial customers.

Regulatory Matters

As a U.S. government contractor, our business is heavily regulated and, as a result, our need for compliance awareness and business and employee support is significant. Specifically, our industry is governed by various laws and regulations, including but not limited to laws and regulations relating to: the formation, administration, and performance of contracts; the security and control of information and information systems; international trade compliance; human trafficking; the mandatory disclosure of “credible evidence” of a violation of certain criminal laws; and the civil False Claims Act, which is intended to prevent fraud against the U.S. government. In addition, U.S. government contractors are generally subject to other requirements, including:

•the FAR and related regulations, which regulate the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts;

•the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of certain contracts, modifications, or task orders; 

•the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information, as well as certain internal government procurement sensitive information. In addition, this act regulates our ability to provide compensation to certain former government procurement officials; 

•laws and regulations restricting the ability of a contractor to provide gifts or gratuities to employees of the U.S. government;

•post-government employment laws and regulations, which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit and hire current employees of the U.S. government and deploy former employees of the U.S. government;

•laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes or determined to be “controlled unclassified information” or “for official use only”;

7

•laws and regulations relating to the export of certain products, services, and technical data, including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work;

•laws, regulations, and executive orders regulating the handling, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information in the course of performing a U.S. government contract; 

•laws, regulations, and executive orders governing organizational conflicts of interest that may prevent us from bidding for or restrict our ability to compete for certain U.S. government contracts because of the work that we currently perform for the U.S. government; 

•laws, regulations, and executive orders that mandate compliance with requirements to protect the government from risks related to our supply chain;

•laws, regulations, and mandatory contract provisions providing protections to employees or subcontractors seeking to report alleged fraud, waste, and abuse related to a government contract;

•the “Contractor Business Systems Rule,” which authorizes DoD agencies to withhold a portion of our payments if we are determined to have a significant deficiency in any of our accounting, cost estimating, purchasing, earned value management, material management and accounting, or property management systems; and

•the “Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles,” which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time.

We are also subject to oversight by the U.S. Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs for federal contract and affirmative action compliance, including in the following areas:

•affirmative action plans;

•applicant tracking;

•compliance training;

•customized affirmative action databases and forms;

•glass ceiling and compensation audits;

•desk and on-site audits;

•conciliation agreements;

•disability accessibility for applicants and employees;

•diversity initiatives;

•Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) compliance;

•employment eligibility verification (known as “E-Verify”);

•internal affirmative action audits;

•Internet recruiting and hiring processes;

•Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”) administrative enforcement actions;

•record-keeping requirements; and

•Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.

The U.S. government routinely revises its procurement practices and adopts new contract rules and regulations. In order to anticipate compliance with changes to laws and regulations, we participate in industry-wide associations that represent industry perspectives on proposed regulations to the government, monitor proposed regulatory changes to adapt our policies and processes to changes once effective, maintain compliance staff in our corporate departments, and conduct awareness and training for affected employees, such as our contracts staff and DCAA compliance team.

The U.S. government has a broad range of tools available to enforce its procurement law and policies. These include debarring or suspending a particular contractor, certain of its operations, and/ or individual employees from future government business. In addition to any statutory recourse available to the government, individuals may bring qui tam suits, on behalf of the federal government, against us for any alleged fraud related to payments under a U.S. government contract or program.

Seasonality

The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds. In addition, we generally experience increased bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. government’s fiscal year end as we pursue new contract opportunities being awarded shortly after the U.S. government fiscal year end. Finally, we tend to generate less revenue and profit from our labor services during the third quarter as a result higher leave-taking during the holiday season.
