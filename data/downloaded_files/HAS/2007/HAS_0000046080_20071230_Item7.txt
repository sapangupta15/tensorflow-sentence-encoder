 Executive Summary  

 The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the out-licensing of its properties for use in connection with non-competing products offered by third parties. The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year and within that half, the fourth quarter. In 2007, 66% of the Companys net revenues were generated in the second half of the year with 34% of annual net revenues generated in the fourth quarter. In 2006 and 2005, percentages were 68% and 67% for the second half, respectively, and comparable at 35% for the fourth quarter. While many of the Companys products are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties, such as MARVEL and STAR WARS properties.  

 The Companys business is primarily separated into two business segments, North America and International. The North American segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin America marketing operations. In addition to these two primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment. The Hasbro Products Group is responsible for the worldwide out-licensing of the Companys intellectual properties and works closely with the North American and International segments on the development and out-licensing of the Companys brands.  

 The Companys focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet. While the Company believes it has achieved a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths. In 2007, the Company had significant sales of products related to the Companys license with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc. (collectively Marvel), primarily due to the theatrical release of SPIDERMAN-3 in May of 2007. Given the strength of its core brands, the Company may also seek to drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment-based theatrical venues. As an example of this, in July of 2007, the TRANSFORMERS motion picture was released and the Company developed and marketed products based on the motion picture. As a result of pairing this core brand with this type of entertainment, both the movie and the product line benefited. Net revenues during 2007 related to the TRANSFORMERS line of products totaled approximately $482,000, or 12.6% of consolidated net revenues.  

 The Companys core brands represent Company-owned or Companycontrolled brands, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE and TONKA, which have been successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth. In 2007 the Company had strong sales of core brand products, namely TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAYSKOOL, MONOPOLY, NERF, and PLAY-DOH.  

 20   
 In addition to its focus on core brands, the Companys strategy also involves trying to meet ever-changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights. The Company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any one product line.  

 While the Companys strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative new products, it will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the Company believes it is economically attractive. In 2006, the Company entered into a license with Marvel to produce toys and games based on Marvels portfolio of characters. The Company had significant sales of products related to this license during 2007, primarily due to the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007. The Company has also incurred royalties on products based on the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. While gross profits of theatrical entertainment-based products are generally higher than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilms STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on property right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties, further impacting profit made on these products.  

 The Companys long-term strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world. As part of this strategy, in August 2007, the Company announced a multi-year strategic agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA). The agreement gives EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject to existing limitations on the Companys rights and certain other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on a broad spectrum of the Companys intellectual properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA and LITTLEST PET SHOP. As part of this agreement, the Company has also obtained the rights to create toys and non-digital games based on EAs intellectual properties. The first games under this agreement are expected to launch in 2008.  

 While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth of its business, it continues to be focused on reducing fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over the last 5 years the Company has improved its operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 13.5% in 2007. The Company reviews it operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce its cost structure in an efficient manner. In 2006 the Company announced a reduction of its manufacturing activity in Ireland and transition of the manufacture of certain products to the Companys suppliers in China, and recently the Company announced a restructuring of its games manufacturing facility in the U.S. that is also expected to result in work practice efficiencies and cost reductions. The Company is also investing to grow its business in emerging international markets and will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business. For example, in January of 2008, the Company acquired Cranium, Inc., which develops and markets a wide range of CRANIUM branded games and related products. In 2008, the Company expects to leverage revenue to offset the impact of these investments on its operating margins.  

 In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, over the last three years, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) has adopted three repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,200,000. After fully exhausting the prior two authorizations, the third authorization was passed on August 2, 2007 for $500,000. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, $390,399 of common stock was repurchased under this authorization. For the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company invested $587,004, $456,744 and $48,030, respectively, in the repurchase of 20,795, 22,767 and 2,386 shares, respectively, in the open market. Also, in May of 2007, the Company paid $200,000 in cash to repurchase exercisable warrants to purchase 15,750 shares of the Companys common stock. Subsequent to December 30, 2007, the Board approved an additional $500,000 share repurchase authorization. The Company intends to opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions. In addition, in February 2008, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. This was the fifth consecutive year that the Board has increased the dividend.

 Summary   

 The components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, are illustrated below for each of the three fiscal years ended December 30, 2007.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Results of Operations  

 The fiscal years ended December 30, 2007 and December 25, 2005 were fifty-two week periods while the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three week period.  

 Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007 were $333,003, or $1.97 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2006 and 2005 of $230,055 and $212,075, or $1.29 and $1.09 per diluted share, respectively.  

 Net earnings includes non-operating (income) expense related to the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability of $44,370 in 2007, $31,770 in 2006, and $(2,080) in 2005. These warrants were repurchased during May 2007. Net earnings for 2007 also includes a favorable tax adjustment of $29,619, or $0.17 per diluted share, related to the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits.  

 Net earnings for 2005 include income tax expense of approximately $25,800 related to the Companys repatriation of approximately $547,000 of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 pursuant to the special incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  

 On December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which required that the Company measure all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its financial statements. The Company adopted this statement using the modified prospective method. Under this adoption method, the Company is recording expense related to stock option awards that were unvested as of the date of adoption as well as all awards made after the date of adoption. Accordingly, 2005 net earnings do not include expense related to stock options.  

 Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2007 were $3,837,557 compared to $3,151,481 in 2006 and $3,087,627 in 2005. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its two principal segments: North America and International, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation in the amount of $94,500  

 22   
 in 2007 and $27,800 in 2006 as the result of the overall weaker U.S. dollar in each of those years. The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys two principal segments for 2007, 2006 and 2005. The operating profit for 2005 for each of these segments has been adjusted to include the impact of expense related to stock options as disclosed under SFAS 123, consistent with the Companys management reporting. See notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 North America  

 North American segment net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2007 increased 15% to $2,460,016 from $2,130,290 in 2006. The impact of foreign currency translation on North American segment net revenues in 2007 was favorable, primarily due to the strength of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, and increased net revenues by approximately $4,800. The increase was due primarily to increased revenues in the boys toys category driven by sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products due to the theatrical releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. Although STAR WARS product sales declined in 2007 from 2006, sales of these products have continued to be a significant contributor to boys toys revenues in 2007. Revenues in the girls toys category increased as a result of higher sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products as well as higher revenues from the BABY ALIVE line which was reintroduced in the second quarter of 2006. To a lesser extent, revenues in the girls toys category were positively impacted by increased shipments of MY LITTLE PONY products. Girls toys revenues were negatively impacted by decreased sales of EASY-BAKE oven products due to the recall of the product in July of 2007. Revenues from the preschool category were flat for 2007. Revenue from games and puzzles decreased slightly due to lower revenues from trading card and plug and play games partially offset by increased sales of traditional board games. Revenues from the tweens category decreased as a result of lower sales of electronic products such as VIDEONOW, ZOOMBOX and I-DOG partially offset by increased sales of NERF products. Revenues in 2007 were also positively impacted by increased sales of TOOTH TUNES.  

 North American operating profit increased to $318,737 in 2007 from $275,959 in 2006. Operating profit in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately $1,500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating profit is primarily the result of higher gross profits resulting from the higher revenues discussed above. Although North American gross profit increased as a result of higher revenues, this increase in gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 of charges recorded in the second quarter of 2007 related to the July 2007 EASY-BAKE oven recall. The increase in gross profit was also partially offset by higher royalty expense as the result of the increased sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products. Operating profit was also impacted by higher advertising expense as well as higher selling and distribution costs related to the increased sales volume. In addition, North American operating profit included increased investment spending in an online initiative of the Companys Wizards of the Coast operation.  

 North American segment net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 4% to $2,130,290 from $2,038,556 in 2005. The impact of foreign currency translation on North American segment net revenues in 2006 was favorable and increased net revenues by approximately $3,200. Anticipated decreased revenues of STAR WARS products were more than offset primarily by increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL, NERF, I-DOG and MONOPOLY products, as well as revenues from the successful reintroduction of BABY ALIVE. Revenues in 2006 were also positively impacted, to a lesser extent, by increased sales of PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS products. STAR WARS revenues were significant in 2005 due to the  

 23   
 theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH and remained strong in 2006.  

 North American segment operating profit increased to $275,959 in 2006 from $165,676 in 2005. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased gross profit as a result of the increased sales in 2006 as well as decreases in royalty and amortization expense principally due to the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products. Operating profit for the North American segment was negatively impacted by higher research and product development costs due to higher investments in the PLAYSKOOL line and costs related to MARVEL products introduced in 2007. North American operating profit was negatively impacted in 2005 by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the electronic games category, which included charges associated with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play games.  

 International  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2007 increased by 33% to $1,278,589 from $959,319 in 2006. In 2007, net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $88,500 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. Although international revenues increased in all categories, the largest increase in net revenues was in the boys toys category. As in the North American segment, this increase was driven by higher sales of TRANSFORMERS products resulting from the theatrical release of the TRANSFORMERS movie in most countries in July of 2007 and MARVEL products resulting from the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007. Increased revenues in the girls toys category were principally the result of increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products, and to a lesser extent, MY LITTLE PONY products. Revenues in the preschool category were higher in 2007 based on increased sales of PLAYSKOOL products, partially due to strong revenues of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN in the United Kingdom. Revenues in the games and puzzles category increased primarily due to increased sales of MONOPOLY. Revenues from the tweens category increased primarily as a result of sales of the POWER TOUR GUITAR which was introduced in 2007.  

 International segment operating profit increased 75% to $158,846 in 2007 from $90,893 in 2006. Operating profit for the segment in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately $10,400 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The remaining increase in operating profit is due to the higher revenues discussed above. The increased gross profit as a result of the higher revenues was partially offset by higher royalty expense due to higher sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products as well as higher advertising and selling, distribution and administration expenses.  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased by 3% to $959,319 from $988,591 in 2005. In 2006 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation by approximately $24,300 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. The decrease in net revenues was primarily the result of decreased sales of STAR WARS products in 2006 as well as decreased sales of FURBY and DUEL MASTERS products. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL and MONOPOLY products. To a lesser extent, 2006 net revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH products as well as the reintroduction of the BABY ALIVE doll.  

 International segment operating profit decreased 15% to $90,893 in 2006 from $106,435 in 2005. Operating profit for the segment in 2006 was positively impacted by approximately $4,900 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in operating profit was the result of decreased gross profit primarily as a result of the decrease in net revenues, partially offset by decreases in royalties and amortization expense as a result of the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products.  

 Gross Profit  

 The Companys gross profit margin increased to 58.9% for the year ended December 30, 2007 from 58.6% in 2006. This increase is due to changes in product mix, primarily the positive impact of higher sales of licensed products. Although licensed products generally carry a higher gross margin, the increased gross margin is largely offset by higher royalty expense associated with these products. Gross profit in 2007 was  

 24   
 also negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 in charges related to the recall of the Companys EASY-BAKE oven product and by a charge of approximately $10,000 related to a restructuring and related reduction in work force at the Companys manufacturing facility in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. This charge consisted primarily of severance costs.  

 The Companys gross profit margin was 58.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 58.3% in 2005. The increase was due to increased revenues from certain core brand products that have higher gross margins, such as LITTLEST PET SHOP products and traditional board games, such as MONOPOLY. Gross profit in 2006 was negatively impacted by a charge of approximately $10,300 related to the Companys decision to transfer certain manufacturing activities from its Ireland manufacturing facility to its suppliers in China. Gross margin in 2005 was also negatively impacted by inventory obsolescence and customer allowances on plug and play games.  

 Expenses  

 The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 30, 2007:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Amortization expense continued to decrease in 2007 to $67,716 from $78,934 in 2006 and $102,035 in 2005. A portion of amortization expense relates to licensing rights and is based on expected sales of products related to those licensing rights. The decrease in amortization expense in 2007 and 2006 primarily relates to decreased amortization of the product rights related to STAR WARS.  

 Royalty expense increased to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in 2007 compared to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products, primarily MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products due to the theatrical releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS in 2007. Royalty expense decreased to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006 compared to $247,283 or 8.0% of net revenues in 2005. This decrease primarily relates to the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products in 2006 from 2005.  

 Research and product development expense decreased in 2007 to $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues from $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This decrease reflects higher investments in the prior year, primarily related to the MARVEL product lines. Research and product development expense increased in 2006 to $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues from $150,586 or 4.9% of net revenues in 2005. This increase was the result of development expenses related to the MARVEL line of products as well as increased investment in the PLAYSKOOL line.  

 Advertising expense increased in dollars to $434,742 in 2007 from $368,996 in 2006, but decreased as a percentage of revenues to 11.3% from 11.7% in 2006. The decrease as a percentage of revenues primarily relates to the mix of sales in 2007, which included increased sales of entertainment-based products, which require lower amounts of advertising and promotion. Revenues related to entertainment-based properties have increased in 2007 with the release of the SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS movies. The increase in dollars is primarily due to continued investment in our PLAYSKOOL line as well as other core brands, and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign exchange. Advertising expense in 2006 was $368,996 or 11.7% of net revenues which was consistent with the 2005 expense of $366,371 or 11.8% of net revenues.  

 Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars to $755,127 from $682,214 in 2006 but decreased as a percentage of revenues to 19.7% from 21.7% in 2006. The increase in dollars reflects higher variable selling and distribution costs resulting from higher revenues in 2007, as well as higher  

 25   
 incentive compensation provisions, the impact of foreign currency, and general inflationary increases. The decrease as a percentage of revenues reflects the fixed nature of certain of these expenses. Selling, distribution and administration expenses were $682,214 or 21.7% of net revenues in 2006 compared to $624,560 or 20.2% in 2005. Approximately $20,000 of this increase related to the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 which required that the Company measure all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its financial statements. The remainder of the increase primarily related to increased sales and marketing expense in 2006 associated with the higher level of sales and increased bonus and incentive provisions due to the strong performance of the Company in 2006.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense increased to $34,618 in 2007 from $27,521 in 2006. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher average borrowings in 2007. In September 2007, the Company issued $350,000 of Notes that are due in 2017. The majority of the proceeds from the issuance of these Notes were used to repay short-term debt resulting from increased repurchases of common stock as well as the repurchase of the Lucas warrants for $200,000.  

 Interest expense decreased to $27,521 in 2006 from $30,537 in 2005. The decrease in interest expense mainly reflected the reduction in the Companys long-term debt over that period. The Company repurchased or repaid principal amounts of long-term debt of $32,743 in 2006 and $93,303 in 2005.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income was $29,973 in 2007 compared to $27,609 in 2006 and $24,157 in 2005. Interest income includes $5,200 in 2006 related to a long-term deposit that was refunded during 2006 and approximately $4,100 in 2005 related to an IRS settlement. The increase in interest income in 2007 primarily reflects higher average rates of return in 2007. To a lesser extent, the increase reflects higher average invested balances in 2007. During a portion of 2007 and 2006, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate securities, which generated a higher rate of return and contributed to the increases in interest income in 2007 and 2006. The Company had no investments in auction rate securities at December 30, 2007.  

 Other (Income) Expense, Net  

 Other (income) expense, net of $52,323 in 2007 compares to $34,977 in 2006 and $(6,772) in 2005. The major component of other (income) expense is non-cash (income) expense related to the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability. These warrants were required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, expense (income) related to the change in fair value of these warrants was $44,370, $31,770 and $(2,080), respectively. In May 2007, the Company exercised the call option on these warrants and repurchased the warrants for $200,000 in cash, which approximated fair value at that date. As these warrants have been repurchased there will be no further fair value adjustments.  

 In addition to the above, other (income) expense, net in 2006 also included $2,629 representing a write-down of the value of common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company as an available-for-sale investment. This write-down resulted from an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of this investment.  

 Income Taxes  

 Income tax expense totaled 28.0% of pretax earnings in 2007 compared with 32.6% in 2006 and 31.8% in 2005. Income tax expense for 2007 is net of a benefit of $29,999 of discrete tax events, primarily relating to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Income tax expense for 2006 includes a charge of approximately $7,800 of discrete tax events, primarily relating to the settlement of various tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2005 includes a charge of approximately $25,800 related to the repatriation of $547,000 of foreign earnings pursuant to the special incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income tax expense for 2005 was also reduced by approximately $4,000, due primarily to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service examination of tax years ending in December 2001. Absent  

 26   
 these items, potential interest and penalties in 2007 related to uncertain tax positions, and the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 30.5% compared to 27.6% in 2006 and 24.9% in 2005. The increase in the adjusted rate to 30.5% in 2007 compared to 27.6% in 2006 primarily reflects the decision to repatriate a portion of 2007 international earnings to the U.S. The increase in the adjusted rate to 27.6% in 2006 from 24.9% in 2005 was the result of higher earnings in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2007, the Company primarily funded its operations and liquidity needs through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities. In September 2007 the Company issued $350,000 in principal amount of notes that are due in 2017 (the Notes). The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were primarily used to repay the Companys short-term borrowings while the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. During 2008, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, using proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its accounts receivable securitization program and other available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2008.  

 At December 30, 2007, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $764,257 compared to $704,818 and $927,592 at December 30, 2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively. Hasbro generated $601,794, $320,647, and $496,624 of cash from its operating activities in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The higher cash flows from operations in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily the result of increased earnings as well as the mix of products in 2007 net revenues. Net earnings in 2007 included increased non-cash royalty expenses primarily as a result of increased revenues from MARVEL products. The royalty expense related to revenues from MARVEL products in 2007 was paid in 2006. Similarly, the higher cash flows from operations in 2005 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the mix of products in 2005 net revenues. Net earnings in 2005 included increased non-cash royalty expenses primarily as a result of increased STAR WARS revenues. Increased royalty expense in 2005 related to revenues from STAR WARS products, most of which had been paid in prior years. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, operating cash flows were impacted by royalty advances paid of $70,000, $105,000 and $35,000 related to MARVEL in 2007 and 2006 and STAR WARS in 2005, respectively.  

 Accounts receivable increased to $654,789 at December 30, 2007 from $556,287 at December 31, 2006. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily the result of higher sales volume in 2007. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding remained consistent at 45 days in both 2007 and 2006 compared to 44 days in 2005. The increase in days sales outstanding from 2005 primarily reflects increases in international accounts receivable due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 and 2007. The December 30, 2007 accounts receivable balance includes an increase of approximately $31,100 related to the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. The Company has a revolving accounts receivable securitization facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided fractional ownership interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, there was $250,000 sold at each period-end under this program.  

 Inventories increased to $259,081 at December 30, 2007 from $203,337 at December 31, 2006. The increase in inventory reflects the growth of the Companys business in 2007. In addition, inventories increased approximately $9,400 due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2007. The increase in inventory to $203,337 at December 31, 2006 from $179,398 at December 25, 2005 represents higher levels of inventory at December 31, 2006 due to anticipated sales of MARVEL products in early 2007. In addition, inventories increased approximately $6,100 due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006.  

 Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $199,912 at December 30, 2007 from $243,291 at December 31, 2006. This decrease is primarily due to utilization of MARVEL and Lucas royalty advances. Generally when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties, an advance  

 27   
 royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made. With respect to the MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses, the Company had prepaid royalties recorded in both current and non-current assets. Each reporting period, the Company reflects as current prepaid assets the amount of royalties it expects to reflect in the statement of operations in the upcoming twelve months. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets also reflects a decrease in deferred tax assets. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $243,291 in 2006 from $185,297 in 2005. This increase was primarily due to a royalty advance paid to MARVEL in 2006, of which approximately $87,400 was recorded in prepaid expenses and $12,930 was shown in other assets at December 31, 2006.  

 Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $742,122 at December 30, 2007 from $895,311 at December 31, 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the Company exercising its call option related to warrants required to be classified as a liability and repurchasing these warrants for $200,000 in cash in the second quarter of 2007. At December 30, 2006, these warrants had a fair value of $155,630. The decrease is also a result of the reclassification of the liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes at the beginning of 2007. These decreases were partially offset by increases in accrued royalties primarily due to the significant sales of TRANSFORMERS movie-related products, accrued advertising due to higher levels of advertising expense in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as higher accounts payable due to higher levels of inventory and expenses as of December 30, 2007. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $895,311 at December 31, 2006 from $863,280 at December 25, 2005. Of this increase, $31,770 related to the increase in fair value of the Lucas warrants that the Company was required to record as liabilities under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150, the Company classified these warrants containing a put option as a current liability and adjusted the amount of this liability to its fair value on a periodic basis. Increases from higher accrued bonus and incentive payments as a result of the Companys strong performance in 2006 were offset by decreases in other accrued amounts, principally accrued royalties.  

 Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $112,465, $83,604, and $120,671 in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In July 2007, with the exception of rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, the Company reacquired the remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). The acquisition price of $19,000 included $18,000 in cash and $1,000 of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of 39 shares of preferred stock held by the Company in a subsidiary of Infogrames. During 2005, the Company expended $65,000 to reacquire the digital gaming rights for certain of its owned or controlled properties from Infogrames. The rights repurchased in 2007 and 2005 were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis as a result of a licensing agreement entered into during 2000. In addition, in 2005 the Company expended $14,179 to purchase the assets of Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal-based creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles. The Company made no acquisitions in 2006. In 2005, the Company also had proceeds from the sales of property, plant and equipment of $33,083. These proceeds were primarily from the sale of the Companys former manufacturing facility in Spain. During 2007, the Company expended approximately $92,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment compared to $82,000 during 2006 and $71,000 during 2005. Of these amounts, 61% in 2007, 63% in 2006, and 61% in 2005 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2008, the Company expects capital expenditures to increase and be in the range of $100,000 to $115,000. During the three years ended December 30, 2007, depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was $88,804, $67,773, and $78,097, respectively.  

 The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable made it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and its accounts receivable securitization program to fund its operations.  

 28   
 The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. During the period from the first day of the October fiscal month through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this limit is increased to $300,000. The program provides the Company with a cost-effective source of working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 30, 2007, the Company had $266,550 available to sell under this program of which $250,000 was utilized.  

 The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides it with a $300,000 committed borrowing facility. The Company has the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of at least $50,000, up to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 30, 2007. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $37,833 was utilized at December 30, 2007. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 30, 2007 were approximately $298,200.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $433,917 in 2007. Of this amount, $584,349, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. In August 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500,000 in common stock after two previous authorizations dated May 2005 and July 2006 of $350,000 each were fully utilized. During 2007, the Company repurchased 20,795 shares at an average price of $28.20. In addition, the Company purchased certain warrants in May 2007 for $200,000 in accordance with the terms of the call provision of the amended Lucas warrant agreement. Dividends paid were $94,097 in 2007 reflecting the increase in the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.16 per share in 2007 compared to $0.12 per share in 2006. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds of $346,009 from the issuance of $350,000 of Notes that are due in 2017. The proceeds from the Notes were primarily used to repay short-term borrowings. The uses of cash were also partially offset by cash receipts of $82,661 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $467,279 in 2006. Of this amount, $456,744, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. In July 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $350,000 in common stock subsequent to the full utilization of the Board of Directors May 2005 authorization of $350,000. During 2006, the Company repurchased 22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03. In addition, $32,743 was used to repay long-term debt. Dividends paid were $75,282 in 2006 reflecting the increase in the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.12 per share in 2006 compared to $0.09 per share in 2005. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of $86,257 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $158,641 in 2005. This amount included repayments in principal amount of long-term debt totaling $93,303. These amounts primarily related to $71,970 of bonds that matured in November of 2005. The remaining amount related to repayment of long-term debt associated with the Companys former manufacturing facility in Spain. Dividends paid increased to $58,901 as a result of the increase of the quarterly dividend rate to $0.09 in 2005 from $0.06. In 2005, the Company repurchased 2,386 of its common shares on the open market at an average price of $20.10 under the Board of Directors May 2005 authorization. The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030. The Company received $45,278 in 2005 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 At December 30, 2007, the Company has outstanding $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, should the price of the Companys stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This  

 29   
 contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. At December 30, 2006, March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2007 this conversion feature was met and the debentures were convertible throughout 2007. During 2007, $168 of these debentures were converted and 8 shares were issued. At December 30, 2007, this conversion feature was met again and the bonds are convertible through March 31, 2008 at which time the requirements of the conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition, if the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day period, the Company has the right to call the debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms described above. The holders of these debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. While the Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash. On December 1, 2005, the holders of these debentures had the option to put these notes back to Hasbro. On that date, the Company redeemed $4 of these notes in cash.  

 The $350,000 Notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the Companys credit ratings on the date of issuance of the Notes. On the date of issuance and throughout the remainder of 2007, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were BBB, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2%. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the Notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.  

 The Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 30, 2007 of approximately $844,815. As detailed below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, this debt is due at varying times from 2008 through 2028. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $18,354 in 2008. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately $70,000 and purchase commitments of $249,883 outstanding at December 30, 2007. The Company believes that cash from operations, including the securitization facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations listed.  

 In August 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500,000 in common stock after two previous authorizations dated May 2005 and July 2006 of $350,000 each were fully utilized. Purchases of the Companys common stock may be made from time to time, subject to market conditions, and may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization and the timing, actual number, and the value of the shares which are repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the Companys common stock. The Company may suspend or discontinue repurchases of its stock at any time and there is no expiration date for such repurchases. In 2007, the Company repurchased 20,795 shares at an average price of $28.20. The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $587,004. On February 7, 2008 the Board of Directors approved an additional $500,000 share repurchase authorization. On that date, approximately $48,300 remained under the August 2007 repurchase authorization.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates   

 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These  

 30   
 estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.  

 Sales Allowances  

 Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2007, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates.  

 Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

 The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2007 and no impairment was indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 30, 2007, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $546,915 recorded on the balance sheet.  

 Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also  

 31   
 requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $410,494 at December 30, 2007. During 2007, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.  

 Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

 The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 30, 2007, the Company had $137,959 of prepaid royalties, $94,616 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $43,343 which are included in other assets.  

 Pension Costs and Obligations  

 The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable discount rates.  

 The estimates for the Companys U.S. plans are established at the Companys measurement date. Prior to 2007, the Company used September 30 as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, (SFAS No. 158) which the Company adopted in December of 2006, the Company changed its measurement date in 2007 to its fiscal year-end date. In accordance with this, the liabilities and assets of the plans were remeasured as of December 31, 2006. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of this remeasurement.  

 The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets was 8.75% in 2007, 2006 and 2005. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2007 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $660.  

 Expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical and expected compensation increases. Based on this analysis, the Companys estimate of expected long-term compensation increases for its U.S. plans was 4.0% in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense.  

 Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Based on this long-term corporate bond yield at December 30, 2007, the Companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities, the Companys discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2007 pension expense averaged 5.83% compared to a rate of 5.50% used in the calculation of 2006 pension expense and 5.75% used in the calculation of 2005 pension expense. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2007 pension expense and the 2007 projected benefit obligation by approximately $744 and $7,779, respectively.  

 32   
 In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 30, 2007, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $19,158 included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans. Pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. Changes in the fair market value of plan assets may impact the amount of future pension expense. During 2007 there were not significant declines in the fair value of pension plan assets. As of December 30, 2007, the Company froze benefits under its largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze.  

 Stock-Based Compensation  

 The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees and non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors. Under this plan, the Company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock, as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards. On December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to measure all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements.  

 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans. The Black-Scholes method includes four significant assumptions: (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk-free interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and (4) expected stock price volatility. For the Companys 2007 and 2006 stock option grants, the weighted average expected term was approximately 5 years. This amount is based on a review of employees exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option. The weighted average risk-free interest rates used for 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 4.79% and 4.98%, respectively. This estimate was based on the interest rate available on U.S. treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option. The weighted average expected dividend yields used for the 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 1.97% and 2.55%, respectively, which is based on the Companys current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant. The weighted average expected stock price volatilities used for 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 22% and 24%, respectively. These amounts were derived using a combination of current and historical implied price volatility. Implied price volatility represents the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the Companys stock, which the Company believes represents the expected future volatility of the Companys stock price. The Company believes that since this is a market-based estimate, it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility.  

 In 2007 and 2006, as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock performance awards, which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the Companys common stock based on the Companys achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended December 2009 for the 2007 award, and over a ten quarter period beginning July 3, 2006 and ending December 2008 for the 2006 award. Each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets. These awards are valued based on the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. The measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the Companys current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period. Changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards.  

 Income Taxes  

 The Companys annual tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities  

 33   
 are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

 An estimated effective tax rate is applied to the Companys quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective tax rate during 2007 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction, as well as the Companys decision to repatriate a portion of 2007 international earnings to the U.S. In addition, changes in judgment related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2007, the Company recorded a total benefit of $29,999 related to discrete tax events primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related reversal of interest.  

 In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected on the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Companys tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized on the Companys tax return. During 2007, the Mexican Government instituted a tax structure which will result in companies paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company believes that it will be subject to the income-based tax in 2008, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.  

 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

 In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $844,815 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 30, 2007, excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 30, 2007 are as follows:

 At December 30, 2007, the Company has a liability, including potential interest and penalties, of $70,571 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these liabilities and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability.  

 Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 30, 2007, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31, 2008, at which time the requirements of the contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated. If the Companys stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at the initial conversion price of $21.60.  

 The Companys agreement with MARVEL provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. The future minimum contractual payments include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of $35,000 payable to MARVEL in 2010 that are contingent upon the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 4.  

 In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $9,200 to its pension plans in 2008. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $70,000 at December 30, 2007.  

 Financial Risk Management  

 The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.  

 To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $52,400 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction.  

 The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 30, 2007, these contracts had unrealized losses of $10,437, of which $6,679 are recorded in accrued liabilities and $3,758 recorded in other liabilities. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 30, 2007 are deferred losses of $11,080, net of tax.  

 At December 30, 2007, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $844,815. At December 30, 2007, the Company had fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $75,000. The interest rate swaps are designed to adjust a portion of the Companys debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long-term debt. At  

 35   
 December 30, 2007, these contracts had a fair value of $256, which was included in other current assets, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase the current portion of long-term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately $39,500 or $35,400, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2008 pretax earnings and cash flows by $379 and $379, respectively.  

 The Economy and Inflation   

 The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 52%, 53%, and 53% of its consolidated net revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

 The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2007, approximately 66% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration may be less in years where the Company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year. In 2007, the Company had products related to two major motion picture releases, SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas.  

 Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.  

 The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2007 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

 Other Information  

 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is applicable for the Company as of December 31, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-b, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which deferred the effective date of the Statement for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.  

 36   
 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R), which makes certain modifications to the accounting for business combinations. These changes include (1) the requirement for an acquirer to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date; (2) the requirement for an acquirer to recognize assets or liabilities arising from contingencies at fair value as of that acquisition date; and (3) the requirement that an acquirer expense all acquisition related costs. This Statement is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal 2009.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (SFAS 160) which requires noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries to be initially measured at fair value and presented as a separate component of shareholders equity. Current practice is to present noncontrolling interests as a liability or other item outside of equity. This Statement is required to be applied prospectively after the beginning of fiscal 2009, although the presentation and disclosure requirements are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet or results of operations.  

 The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
