 Executive Summary  

 The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with non-competing products, including digital games, offered by third parties. The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the second half of the year accounted for 65%, 63% and 66% of the Companys net revenues, respectively. While many of the Companys products are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also offers products which are based on licensed rights from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties, such as the MARVEL and STAR WARS properties.  

 The Companys business is separated into three principal business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the U.S. and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South American marketing and sales operations. The Companys Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Companys lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and online entertainment operations. In addition to these three primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment.  

 The Company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas important to its consumers. Brand awareness is amplified through immersive traditional play, digital applications, publishing and lifestyle licensing and entertainment experiences presented for the consumers enjoyment. The Companys focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights, offering immersive entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the Companys brands across different forms and formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and maintain a strong balance sheet. The Companys core brands represent Company-owned or Company-controlled brands, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE, NERF and TONKA, which have been successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2009 the Company had strong revenues from core brands, namely TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, NERF, MONOPOLY, PLAYSKOOL, PLAY-DOH, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and G.I. JOE. The Companys strategy of re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting its brands has been instrumental to achieving its overall long-term growth objectives.  

 The Company also seeks to drive revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment. As an example of this, in June of 2009, the TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN motion picture was released as a sequel to the 2007 motion picture TRANSFORMERS. In addition, in August 2009, the motion picture G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA was released. The Company developed and    

 22   
 marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. As a result of pairing these core brands with motion picture entertainment, both the movies and the product lines benefited. In addition, the Company has entered into a strategic relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least three motion pictures based on certain of Hasbros core brands, with the potential for production of two additional pictures. The first movie is expected to be released in 2012. As part of its strategy, in addition to using theatrical entertainment, the Company continues to seek opportunities to use other entertainment outlets and forms of entertainment as a way to build awareness of its brands which has proved instrumental to achieving its overall long-term growth objectives.  

 In April 2009 the Company announced the entry into an agreement to form a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. (Discovery) to create a television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming. The transaction closed in May 2009. Programming on the network will include content based on Hasbros brands, Discoverys library of childrens educational programming, as well as programming developed by third parties. The Company expects the rebranded network, THE HUB, to debut in late fall of 2010 and believes that it will reach approximately 60 million homes in the U.S. at that time, with programming targeted to children 14 years of age and under. The Company believes that this effort will support its strategy of growing its core brands well beyond traditional toys and games and to provide immersive entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format. In connection with this transaction, the Company has begun building an internal creative group that will be responsible for the creation and development of television programming based on Hasbros brands. The Company expects to incur a certain level of investment spending leading up to the debut of the rebranded channel, as well as costs in 2010 and beyond related to the production of television programming.  

 While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths. The Companys primary licenses include its agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (Marvel); Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (Lucas), related to the STAR WARS brand; and Sesame Workshop, related to the Sesame Street brand of characters. The majority of product offerings under the Sesame Workshop license will commence in 2011. In 2009 and 2008, the Company had significant sales of products related to the Companys license with Marvel, primarily due to the movie releases of IRON MAN in May 2008, THE INCREDIBLE HULK in June 2008 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE in May 2009. In addition, the Company had significant sales in 2008 of products related to the movie release of STAR WARS: CLONE WARS in August 2008 as well as sales from the movie release of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL in May 2008. During 2009 the Company has also had a high level of revenues from products related to television programming based on SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS.  

 While gross profits of theatrical entertainment-based products are generally higher than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products, including our owned or controlled brands based on a movie release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilms STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on property right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties, further impacting profits earned on these products.  

 The Companys long-term strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world. As part of this strategy, the Company entered into a multi-year strategic agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) in 2007. The agreement gives EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject to existing limitations on the Companys rights and certain other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on a broad spectrum of the Companys intellectual properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA, G.I. JOE and LITTLEST PET SHOP. A number of products under this agreement have been released in 2008 and 2009 and the line will continue to be updated and expanded in 2010.  

 The Company is also investing to grow its business in emerging markets. During the last two years, the Company expanded its operations in China, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Romania and the Czech Republic. In    

 23   
 addition, the Company is seeking to grow its business in entertainment and digital gaming, and will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms of media. In addition to the Discovery joint venture discussed above, another example of this includes the acquisition of Cranium, Inc., a developer and marketer of CRANIUM branded games and related products, in 2008. In addition, in the second quarter of 2008, the Company acquired the rights to TRIVIAL PURSUIT, a brand which the Company had previously licensed on a long-term basis. Ownership of the rights will allow the Company to further leverage the brand in different media. In 2009, the Company continued to expand its brand portfolio through several smaller brand acquisitions that it believes will be complementary to its core brands.  

 While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth of its business, it also continues to be focused on reducing fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over the last 7 years the Company has improved its full year operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 14.5% in 2009. The Company reviews its operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce the cost structure of its underlying business and promote efficiency.  

 In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, over the last five years, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) has adopted four successive share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,700,000. After fully exhausting the prior three authorizations, the fourth authorization was approved on February 7, 2008 for $500,000. For the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company spent $90,994, $357,589 and $587,004, respectively, to repurchase 3,172, 11,736 and 20,795 shares, respectively, in the open market. Also in 2007, the Company paid $200,000 in cash to repurchase exercisable warrants for 15,750 shares of the Companys common stock. The Company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions. At December 27, 2009, the Company had $161,434 remaining under the February 2008 authorization. In addition, in February 2010 the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.  

 During 2009, the Company operated in an environment of both a stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies compared to 2008 as well as weakened overall economic conditions. Accordingly, the Company has sought to mitigate the impact of these conditions by instituting a variety of cost control initiatives. As of December 27, 2009 the Company had $636,045 in cash and cash equivalents and had available capacity, if needed, under its revolving credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization program. In connection with the announcement of a joint venture agreement with Discovery in April 2009, the Company made a $300,000 cash payment to purchase its 50% share of the joint venture. The Company funded its investment through the issuance of debt with a principal amount of $425,000 in May 2009. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its available lines of credit, accounts receivable securitization program and other borrowing facilities are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2010.

 Summary   

 The components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, are illustrated below for each of the three fiscal years ended December 27, 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Results of Operations  

 Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 27, 2009 were fifty-two week periods.  

 Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2009 were $374,930, or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2008 and 2007 of $306,766 and $333,003, or $2.00 and $1.97 per diluted share, respectively.  

 Net earnings for 2009 include dilution from the Companys investment in the joint venture with Discovery and its issuance of $425,000 of long-term debt, both of which closed in May 2009, as well as the start-up of the Companys internal television studio. Net earnings for 2007 includes non-operating expense related to the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability of $44,370. These warrants were repurchased during May 2007. Net earnings for 2007 also includes a favorable tax adjustment of $29,619 related to the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits.  

 In January 2008, the Company acquired Cranium, Inc. (Cranium). The results of operations for 2008 include the operations of Cranium from the acquisition closing date of January 25, 2008.  

 Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 were $4,067,947 compared to $4,021,520 in 2008 and $3,837,557 in 2007. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2009 were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $65,200 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 as compared to 2008. Consolidated net revenues in 2008 were also negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $10,300 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007.   

 25   
 The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for 2009, 2008 and 2007.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 U.S. and Canada  

 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 increased 2% to $2,447,943 from $2,406,745 in 2008. The increase in net revenues in 2009 was primarily due to increased revenues in the boys toys category, primarily as a result of increased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products due to the theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN in June 2009 and G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA in August 2009, as well as increased sales of NERF products. Increased sales in the boys toys category were partially offset by decreased sales of STAR WARS, MARVEL and INDIANA JONES products. The increase in U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for 2009 was also due to increased revenues in the preschool category primarily resulting from higher sales of TONKA and PLAY-DOH products, partially offset by decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL products. Revenues from sales of PLAYSKOOL products declined primarily as a result of decreased sales of ROSE PETAL COTTAGE products which are no longer in the Companys product line. Revenues from the girls toys category decreased primarily as a result of lower sales of BABY ALIVE and I-DOG products, partially offset by sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products which were reintroduced to the Companys line in the second quarter of 2009. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP products decreased slightly in 2009, sales of these products remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2009. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased slightly in 2009, primarily due to decreased sales of traditional board games, partially offset by increased revenues from sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading cards. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been discontinued in the Companys product line.  

 U.S. and Canada operating profit increased to $380,580 in 2009 from $283,152 in 2008. Operating profit in 2009 was positively impacted by approximately $3,100 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. U.S. and Canada gross profit increased in 2009 primarily as a result of the increased revenues discussed above, lower obsolescence charges, and a change in the mix of products sold, primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in operating profit for 2009 also reflects decreased selling, distribution and administration expenses which primarily reflect lower shipping and distribution costs as well as decreased marketing and sales expenses. In addition, operating profit increased as a result of decreased advertising expense.  

 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2008 increased 5% to $2,406,745 from $2,293,742 in 2007. The impact of foreign currency translation on U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008 was unfavorable and decreased net revenues by approximately $3,100. The increase in net revenues in 2008 was primarily due to higher revenues in the boys toys category, driven by increased sales of STAR WARS and NERF products and sales of INDIANA JONES products. Although revenues from TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL products decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of the significant sales recognized in the prior year due to the theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007 and SPIDER-MAN 3 in May 2007, these lines remained significant contributors to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. The overall increase in segment net revenues for 2008 was also due to increased revenues in    

 26   
 the games and puzzles category as a result of increased sales of DUEL MASTERS and TRIVIAL PURSUIT games and the impact of the acquisition of Cranium, partially offset by decreased revenues from plug and play games, as well as increased sales of products in the preschool category. Revenues from the girls toys category decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of I-DOG, and to a lesser extent, decreased revenues from MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS, and LITTLEST PET SHOP. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP decreased slightly in 2008, sales of these products remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. Decreases in girls toys net revenues were partially offset by increased sales as a result of the reintroduction of EASY-BAKE oven. Revenues in 2008 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES and POWER TOUR GUITAR, which are no longer in the Companys product line.  

 U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $283,152 in 2008 from $287,800 in 2007. Operating profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by approximately $1,100 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. U.S. and Canada segment gross profits increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2008 primarily as a result of the increased promotional programs implemented by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2008, including the provision of sales allowances and markdowns, to address the weak retail environment. The increase in gross profit in dollars was more than offset by increased product development and sales and marketing expenses related to investments the Company made in both core brands and its digital initiative related to its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary; increased amortization as a result of the acquisition of Cranium and the purchase of intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT; increased royalty expense; and increased shipping and distribution costs, reflecting higher sales volume and higher transportation costs.  

 International  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 decreased by 3% to $1,459,476 from $1,499,334 in 2008. In 2009, net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $64,500 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment net revenues increased 2% in local currency in 2009. The increase in local currency net revenues was driven by increased sales in the boys toys category, primarily as a result of increased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products, as well as increased sales of NERF products. Increases in boys toys net revenues were partially offset by lower revenues from MARVEL, ACTION MAN, INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS products. Net revenues in the girls toys category decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and FURREAL FRIENDS products, partially offset by increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products and sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products, which were reintroduced to the Companys line in the second quarter of 2009. Net revenues in the preschool category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues from sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN and PLAYSKOOL products, partially offset by increased revenues from sales of PLAY-DOH products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased slightly as a result of decreased sales of board games. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been discontinued in the Companys product line.  

 International segment operating profit decreased 2% to $162,159 in 2009 from $165,186 in 2008. Operating profit for the International segment in 2009 was positively impacted by approximately $9,500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. Increased local currency gross profit in 2009 as a result of the increased net revenues discussed above was more than offset by increased operating expenses, including the impact of our investments in opening offices in emerging international markets. In addition, International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom of approximately $6,000.  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2008 increased by 4% to $1,499,334 from $1,444,863 in 2007. In 2008 net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $7,400 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar. The increase in net revenues was primarily the result of increased product sales in the girls toys and preschool categories primarily relating to LITTLEST PET SHOP in the girls toys category and IN THE NIGHT GARDEN and PLAYSKOOL products in the    

 27   
 preschool category. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING products, TRIVIAL PURSUIT products and MONOPOLY products. Net revenues in the boys toys category decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products, however, both product lines continued to be significant contributors to International segment net revenues in 2008. Decreased net revenues in the boys toys category were partially offset by increased sales of STAR WARS and NERF products and sales of INDIANA JONES products. International segment net revenues in 2008 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of POWER TOUR GUITAR, which was no longer in the Companys product line.  

 International segment operating profit decreased 13% to $165,186 in 2008 from $189,783 in 2007. Operating profit for the International segment in 2008 was negatively impacted by approximately $4,400 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in International segment operating profit also reflects promotional programs implemented by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2008 in response to weakened retail conditions; increased advertising expense; and increased investments in emerging markets; partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result of lower sales of entertainment-based products. In addition, International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom.  

 Entertainment and Licensing  

 During the second quarter of 2009, the Company changed the name of its Other segment to the Entertainment and Licensing segment. This segment includes the Companys lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and online entertainment operations. The Entertainment and Licensing segments net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 increased 44% to $155,013 from $107,929 for the year ended December 28, 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher lifestyle and digital gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE licensed products.  

 Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased 28% to $65,572 in 2009 from $51,035 in 2008. Operating profit increased as a result of the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased selling, distribution and administrative expenses which included approximately $7,200 in transaction costs related to the Companys investment in the joint venture with Discovery, start-up costs associated with the Companys television studio, as well as increased intangible amortization and royalty expense. While the Discovery joint venture is a component of our television operations, the Companys 50% share in the earnings from the joint venture are included in other (income) expense and therefore are not a component of operating profit of the segment.  

 The Entertainment and Licensing segments net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2008 increased 24% to $107,929 from $87,245 for the year ended December 30, 2007. The increase reflects licensing revenues related to the Companys partnership with EA to develop digital games based on the Companys intellectual property. EA began introducing products based on the Companys intellectual property in 2008. The increase in revenues from the introduction of these products offset decreases in lifestyle licensing revenues as a result of the significant licensing revenues in 2007 related to the TRANSFORMERS motion picture.  

 Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased 31% to $51,035 in 2008 from $38,881 in 2007. Operating profit for 2008 increased as a result of the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased selling, distribution and administrative expenses.  

 Gross Profit  

 The Companys gross profit margin increased to 58.8% for the year ended December 27, 2009 from 57.9% in 2008. The increase was partially due to a change in the mix of revenues reflecting higher licensing revenues in 2009. In addition, the increased gross profit reflects a change in product mix primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products in 2009 as compared to 2008. While gross profits of theatrical entertainment-based products are generally higher than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products, including Company owned or controlled brands based on a movie release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the benefit of these higher gross margins. Gross profits in 2009 were also    

 28   
 positively impacted by lower obsolescence charges. In addition, gross profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by the incremental promotional programs discussed below.  

 The Companys gross profit margin decreased to 57.9% for the year ended December 28, 2008 from 58.9% in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to incremental promotional programs, including sales allowances and markdowns, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weak retail environment, as well as changes in product mix. Decreases in gross profit as the result of input cost inflation were partially offset by cost savings initiatives and an increase in pricing of certain of the Companys products. Gross profit in 2007 was also negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 in charges related to the recall of the Companys EASY-BAKE oven product and by a charge of approximately $10,000 related to a restructuring and related reduction in work force at the Companys manufacturing facility in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts.  

 Expenses  

 The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 27, 2009:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Amortization expense increased to $85,029 or 2.1% of net revenues in 2009 compared to $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues in 2008. The increase is primarily a result of accelerated amortization related to a write-down of the carrying value of certain property rights. Amortization expense increased to $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues in 2008 compared to $67,716 or 1.8% of net revenues in 2007. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of Cranium in January 2008 and the purchase of the intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT in the second quarter of 2008. Property rights of $68,500 and $80,800 were recorded as a result of the Cranium acquisition and the purchase of TRIVIAL PURSUIT, respectively, and are each being amortized over fifteen years. The Company expects amortization expense to decrease in 2010 primarily as a result of the property rights related to Wizards of the Coast becoming fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2009. Accordingly, based on the Companys current property rights, the Company expects amortization expense to be approximately $49,000 in 2010.  

 Royalty expense increased to $330,651 or 8.1% of net revenues in 2009 compared to $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in 2008. The increase in royalty expense is primarily the result of increased sales of entertainment-driven products, including TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Royalty expense decreased to $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in 2008 compared to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in 2007. The decrease in royalty expense was primarily the result of the impact of foreign exchange. Absent this foreign exchange impact, royalty expense decreased slightly as the result of slightly lower sales of entertainment-based products.  

 Research and product development expense decreased in 2009 to $181,195 or 4.5% of net revenues from $191,424 or 4.8% of net revenues in 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflects an effort to reduce the Companys overall SKU count and make research and development spending more efficient as part of the Companys ongoing cost control efforts. Research and product development expense increased in 2008 to $191,424 or 4.8% of net revenues from $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues in 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected higher investments in the Companys core brands, increased expenditures relating to the Companys digital initiatives, as well as additional expenses as a result of the Companys Cranium acquisition. The Company expects research and product development expense to increase in 2010, primarily as a result of costs associated with the development of products related to the Companys agreement with Sesame Workshop as well as other entertainment-related properties.   

 29   
 Advertising expense decreased to $412,580 or 10.1% of net revenues in 2009 compared to $454,612 or 11.3% of net revenues in 2008. In years in which the Company has significant sales of products related to major motion picture releases, such as in 2009, advertising expense as a percentage of revenue is generally lower, as such products do not require the same level of advertising that the Company spends on non-entertainment based products. The decrease in advertising expense in 2009 also reflects lower advertisement placement costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange. Advertising expense increased in dollars to $454,612 in 2008 from $434,742 in 2007, but remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 11.3%. The increase in dollars was primarily the result of higher spending to increase awareness of the Companys brands.  

 Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to $793,558 or 19.5% of net revenues in 2009, compared to $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in 2009. Included in selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2009 were approximately $7,200 in transaction costs related to the Companys purchase of a 50% interest in the joint venture with Discovery. The increase in selling, distribution and administration expense in 2009 also reflects higher incentive compensation expense as well as costs related to the start up of the Companys television studio and continued investments in emerging markets. Selling, distribution and administration expense in 2009 was also positively impacted by lower shipping and distribution costs in 2009. In addition, selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2008 were positively impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom of approximately $6,000. Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008, compared to $755,127 or 19.7% of net revenues in 2007. The increase reflected increased sales and marketing expenses to support the growth in the business; increased investment in the expansion into emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Russia, the Czech Republic and Korea; increased investment in the Companys digital and entertainment strategies; and increased shipping and distribution costs associated with both increased sales volume and higher transportation costs.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense increased to $61,603 in 2009 from $47,143 in 2008. The increase in interest expense reflects both higher outstanding borrowings and a higher average borrowing rate as a result of the issuance of $425,000 of notes in May 2009. The proceeds from the issuance of notes in May 2009 were primarily used to purchase a 50% interest in the joint venture with Discovery. Interest expense in 2009 also includes approximately $4,000 in costs related to a short-term borrowing facility commitment the Company entered into in April 2009 in connection with the Companys anticipated investment in the joint venture with Discovery. In addition, interest expense in 2009 includes amounts related to the Companys tax sharing agreement with Discovery.  

 Interest expense increased to $47,143 in 2008 from $34,618 in 2007. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher average borrowings in 2008 primarily as a result of the issuance of $350,000 of notes in September 2007, partially offset by the repayment of $135,092 of notes in July 2008. The increase in the average borrowing rate for 2008 from the issuance of long-term debt in 2007 was more than offset by decreases in the average borrowing rate on short-term debt in 2008 as well as the repayment of 6.15% notes in July 2008.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income was $2,858 in 2009 compared to $17,654 in 2008. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower returns on invested cash as well as lower average invested cash balances. Interest income was $17,654 in 2008 compared to $29,973 in 2007. The decrease in interest income in 2008 from 2007 was primarily the result of lower returns on invested cash. In addition, during a portion of 2007, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate securities, which generated a higher rate of return and contributed to the higher level of interest income in 2007.   

 30   
 Other (Income) Expense, Net  

 Other (income) expense, net of $156 in 2009 compares to $23,752 in 2008. Other (income) expense, net in 2009 includes income of $(3,856) representing the Companys 50% share in the earnings of the joint venture with Discovery. The remainder of the change in other (income) expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflects the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses.  

 Other (income) expense, net of $23,752 in 2008 compares to $52,323 in 2007. In 2007 the major component of other (income) expense related to the change in fair value of the Lucas warrants, which were required to be classified as a liability. These warrants were required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. In May 2007, the Company exercised the call option on these warrants and repurchased them for $200,000 in cash, which approximated fair value at that date. As these warrants were repurchased in 2007, there was no fair value adjustment in 2008. For 2007, expense related to the change in fair value of these warrants was $44,370. Absent the impact of the fair value adjustments, increased expense in 2008 primarily relates to increased foreign exchange losses arising from the impact of the large downward movement in foreign exchange rates, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008, on non-U.S. denominated intercompany balances.  

 Income Taxes  

 Income tax expense totaled 29.2% of pretax earnings in 2009 compared with 30.4% in 2008 and 28.0% in 2007. Income tax expense for 2009 is net of a benefit of approximately $2,300 of discrete tax events, primarily related to the expiration of state statutes and settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2008 is net of a benefit of approximately $10,200 related to discrete tax events, primarily comprised of a benefit from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings, as well as the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2007 was net of a benefit of $29,999 related to discrete tax events, primarily relating to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Absent these items and potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in 2009, 2008 and 2007, the effective tax rates would have been 29.0%, 32.8% and 30.5%, respectively. The decrease in the adjusted tax rate from 32.8% in 2008 compared to 29.0% in 2009 primarily reflects the decision to provide for the repatriation of a portion of 2008 international earnings to the U.S. The increase in the adjusted rate to 32.8% in 2008 from 30.5% in 2007 primarily reflects the change in the mix of where the Company earned its profits.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2009, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program. During 2010, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2010, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us.  

 At December 27, 2009, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $621,932 compared to $622,804 and $764,257 at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively. Hasbro generated $265,623, $593,185 and $601,794 of cash from its operating activities in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009 operating cash flows as compared to 2008 primarily reflects an increase in accounts    

 31   
 receivable, primarily as a result of the Companys decision not to utilize its securitization program at December 27, 2009. At December 28, 2008, $250,000 was utilized under the program. In 2009, operating cash flows were also impacted by increased royalty payments, including a $50,000 guaranteed royalty payment to Marvel related to the extension of the current agreement and a $25,000 guaranteed royalty payment to the Discovery joint venture. Further, the decrease in inventory had a positive impact on 2009 operating cash flows. In 2007 operating cash flows were impacted by royalty advances paid of $70,000 related to the Marvel license. In addition, 2007 net earnings included non-cash expense of $44,370 related to the fair value adjustment of the Lucas warrants that were repurchased in May of 2007. The remaining decrease in 2008 operating cash flows was due to decreased net earnings in 2008 compared to 2007.  

 Accounts receivable increased to $1,038,802 at December 27, 2009 from $611,766 at December 28, 2008. The accounts receivable balance at December 27, 2009 includes an increase of approximately $33,200 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar at December 27, 2009 as compared to December 28, 2008. Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the utilization of the Companys securitization program at December 28, 2008 of $250,000. At December 27, 2009, based on the Companys cash position and liquidity needs, there was no utilization of the securitization program. The increase in accounts receivable also reflects higher sales, and the timing of those sales, in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to 2008. Accounts receivable decreased to $611,766 at December 28, 2008 from $654,789 at December 30, 2007. The accounts receivable balance at December 28, 2008 includes a decrease of approximately $61,100 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts receivable increased slightly. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding were 68 days in 2009 and 45 days in both 2008 and 2007. Absent the impact of securitization, days sales outstanding would have been 63 days in 2008 and 2007.  

 Inventories decreased to $207,895 at December 27, 2009 compared to $300,463 at December 28, 2008. The decrease primarily reflects higher inventory levels at December 28, 2008 due to decreased sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. Inventories increased to $300,463 at December 28, 2008 from $259,081 at December 30, 2007. The increase was primarily related to lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weak retail environment and, to a lesser extent, inventory balances related to newly opened operations in emerging markets. The December 28, 2008 inventory balance includes a decrease of approximately $20,900 as a result of the currency impact of the stronger U.S. dollar at December 28, 2008 compared to December 30, 2007.  

 Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $162,290 at December 27, 2009 from $171,387 at December 28, 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the value of the Companys foreign currency contracts as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $18,000 in 2009, which are reflected as an investing activity in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $171,387 at December 28, 2008 from $199,912 at December 30, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to utilization of a portion of the Marvel and the remainder of the Lucas prepaid royalty advances. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made. At December 28, 2008, the Company had prepaid royalties related to the Marvel license in both current and non-current assets. Each reporting period, the Company reflects as current prepaid expense the amount of royalties it expects to reflect in the statement of operations in the upcoming twelve months. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2008 was partially offset by an increase in the value of the Companys foreign currency contracts as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar at December 28, 2008.  

 Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $801,775 at December 27, 2009 from $792,306 at December 28, 2008. The accounts payable and accrued expenses balance at December 27, 2009 includes an increase of approximately $17,700 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar at December 27, 2009 as compared to December 28, 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately $8,300. Decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2009 primarily relate to decreased accrued pension benefits, as well as lower accounts payable. These decreases were partially offset    

 32   
 by higher accrued payroll and management incentives at December 27, 2009. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $792,306 at December 28, 2008 from $742,122 at December 30, 2007. The increase was primarily the result of increased accrued royalties as a result of the utilization of the remainder of the Lucas prepaid royalty advance in the third quarter of 2008 as well as increased accrued pension primarily due to decreases in the Plans asset values in 2008. The December 28, 2008 accounts payable and accrued expenses balance also included a decrease of approximately $64,300 as a result of the currency impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 compared to 2007.  

 Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $497,509, $271,920 and $112,465 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 utilization includes the Companys $300,000 payment to Discovery for its 50% interest in the joint venture, a payment of $45,000 to Lucas to extend the term of the license agreement related to the STAR WARS brand and approximately $26,500 used to acquire certain other intellectual properties. The 2008 utilization includes the Companys purchase of the intellectual property rights related to the TRIVIAL PURSUIT brand for a total cost of $80,800 as well as $65,153 in cash, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Cranium in January 2008. In 2007 the Company reacquired the remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames), with the exception of rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, for an acquisition price of $19,000 which included $18,000 in cash and $1,000 of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of preferred stock held by the Company in a subsidiary of Infogrames. During 2009, the Company expended approximately $104,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment compared to $117,000 during 2008 and $92,000 during 2007. Of these amounts, 58% in 2009, 56% in 2008 and 61% in 2007 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2010, the Company expects capital expenditures to increase and be in the range of $120,000 to $140,000. During the three years ended December 27, 2009, depreciation of plant and equipment was $95,934, $87,873 and $88,804, respectively.  

 The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization program to fund its operations.  

 The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. During the period from the first day of the October fiscal month through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this limit previously was increased to $300,000. The program provides the Company with a source of working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 27, 2009, the Company had availability under this program to sell $300,000, of which no amounts were utilized. In 2010, the facility was amended to extend the agreement through January 2011. Pursuant to this amendment, the limit will be $250,000 for the extension period.  

 The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides it with a $300,000 committed borrowing facility. The Company has the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of at least $50,000, subject to lender agreement, up to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2009. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 27, 2009. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of    

 33   
 December 27, 2009 were approximately $1,400. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 27, 2009 were approximately $298,600. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $42,100 was utilized at December 27, 2009. Of the amount utilized under the uncommitted lines, approximately $13,500 and $28,600 represent outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.  

 Net cash provided by financing activities was $236,779 in 2009. Of this amount, $421,309 reflects net proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes in May 2009. In addition, cash receipts from the exercise of employee stock options in 2009 were $9,193. These sources of cash were partially offset by $88,112, which includes transaction costs, used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2009, the Company repurchased 3,172 shares at an average price per share of $28.67. At December 27, 2009, $161,434 remained under the February 2008 authorization. Dividends paid were $111,458 in 2009 compared to $107,065 in 2008.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $457,391 in 2008. Of this amount, $360,244, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. In February 2008 the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500,000 in common stock after three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006 and August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,200,000 were fully utilized. During 2008, the Company repurchased 11,736 shares at an average price per share of $30.44. Dividends paid were $107,065 in 2008 compared to $94,097 in 2007, reflecting the increase in the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.20 per share in 2008 from $0.16 per share in 2007, and net of the effect of decreased shares outstanding in 2008 as a result of the share repurchases. In addition, $135,092 was used to repay long-term debt. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of $120,895 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $433,917 in 2007. Of this amount, $584,349, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2007, the Company repurchased 20,795 shares at an average price per share of $28.20. In addition, the Company purchased certain warrants in May 2007 for $200,000 in accordance with the terms of the call provision of the amended Lucas warrant agreement. Dividends paid were $94,097 in 2007. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds of $346,009 from the issuance of $350,000 of notes that are due in 2017. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to repay short-term borrowings. The uses of cash were also partially offset by cash receipts of $82,661 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 At December 27, 2009, the Company has outstanding $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, should the price of the Companys common stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. At December 31, 2008 and each of the calendar quarters in 2009 this conversion feature was met and the debentures were convertible throughout 2009. There were no debentures converted during 2009. At December 31, 2009, this conversion feature was met again and the bonds are convertible through March 31, 2010 at which time the requirements of the conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition, if the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day period, the Company has the right to call the debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms described above. At certain times during 2009, based on the Companys common stock price, the Company had the right to call the debentures under this provision. As of December 27, 2009, the Company had the right to call the debentures. The Company believes a call would result in conversion by the holders of the debentures and issuance of the shares, thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding. Historically, based on the Companys targeted capital structure and the low cost of the debentures, when the debentures have been    

 34   
 callable the Company has believed that it was more economically beneficial for it to not exercise its right to call the debentures. Currently, this economic benefit includes a lower cash cost of paying interest on the debentures than the Company would pay in dividends on the incremental number of shares that would be outstanding. The Company will continue to assess, at times when it is available, the desirability of exercising the call option in the future based on the then existing economic circumstances and the Companys business objectives. The holders of these debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. While the Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash.  

 The $350,000 notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the Companys credit ratings on September 17, 2007, the date of issuance of the notes. On the date of issuance, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB and BBB, respectively. There were no changes to the Companys credit ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard & Poors Rating Services from the date of issuance through December 27, 2009. In March 2009, Fitch Ratings upgraded the Companys credit rating to BBB+. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.  

 The $425,000 notes due in 2014 bear interest at a rate of 6.125%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+, respectively, or below. From the date of issuance, May 13, 2009, through December 27, 2009, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB, and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.  

 Including the debentures and notes described above, the Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 27, 2009 of approximately $1,134,723 due at varying times from 2014 through 2028. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately $135,277 and purchase commitments of $251,917 outstanding at December 27, 2009. Letters of credit and similar instruments include $105,335 related to the defense of tax assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $32,761 in 2010.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates   

 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations, stock-based compensation and income taxes.   

 35   
 Sales Allowances  

 Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.  

 For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2009, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates made in prior years.  

 Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

 The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value. Accordingly, no impairment was indicated. The Companys annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and no impairments were indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 27, 2009, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $551,669 recorded on the balance sheet.  

 Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or    

 36   
 decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $478,829 at December 27, 2009. During 2009, the Company wrote down certain intangible assets by approximately $6,700 to reflect revised expectations for the related product lines.  

 Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

 The Companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 27, 2009, the Company had $120,115 of prepaid royalties, $43,115 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $77,000 of which are included in other assets.  

 Pension Costs and Obligations  

 Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. The estimates for the Companys U.S. plans are established at the Companys measurement date. The Company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.  

 The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets used in the calculation of 2009 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 8.50%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2009 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $560.  

 Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Companys discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2009 pension expense averaged 6.20%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2009 pension expense and the 2009 projected benefit obligation by approximately $343 and $8,711, respectively.  

 Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 27, 2009, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $81,323 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $87,906 at December 28, 2008. The decrease primarily reflects amortization of these actuarial losses in 2009. Pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.

 Stock-Based Compensation  

 The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees and non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors. Under this plan, the Company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock, as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards. The Company measures all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 27, 2009, December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 was $29,912, $35,221 and $29,402, respectively. As of December 27, 2009, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost was approximately $31,684.  

 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans. The Black-Scholes method includes four significant assumptions: (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk-free interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and (4) expected stock price volatility. The weighted average expected terms used were approximately 4 years for the 2009 grant and approximately 5 years for the 2008 and 2007 stock option grants. These amounts are based on a review of employees exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option. The weighted average risk-free interest rates used for 2009, 2008 and 2007 stock option grants were 1.87%, 2.71% and 4.79%, respectively. This estimate was based on the interest rate available on U.S. treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option. The weighted average expected dividend yields used for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 stock option grants were 3.52%, 2.95% and 1.97%, respectively, which is based on the Companys current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant. The weighted average expected stock price volatilities used were 36% for the 2009 stock option grant and 22% for the 2008 and 2007 stock option grants. These amounts were derived using a combination of historical price volatility and current implied price volatility. Implied price volatility reflects the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the Companys common stock, which the Company believes represents the expected future volatility of the Companys stock price. The Company believes that since this is a market-based estimate, it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility. The increase in the stock volatility assumption in 2009 reflects the increase in stock market volatility at the time of the Companys 2009 grant.  

 In 2009, 2008 and 2007, as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock performance awards, which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the Companys common stock based on the Companys achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended December 2011, December 2010 and December 2009 for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 awards, respectively. Each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets. These awards are valued based on the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant and expensed over the performance period. The measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the Companys current estimate of net revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period. Changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards.  

 Income Taxes  

 The Companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

 An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the Companys quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys quarterly operating    

 38   
 results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2009 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2009, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately $2,300 related to discrete tax events primarily related to expiration of state statutes and settlement of various tax examinations.  

 In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Companys income tax return. In 2007, the Mexican government instituted a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based tax in 2010, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.  

 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

 In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,134,723 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 27, 2009. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 27, 2009 are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company has a liability at December 27, 2009, including potential interest and penalties, of $115,795 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.   

 39   
 In connection with the Companys agreement to form a joint venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.  

 Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 27, 2009, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31, 2010, at which time the requirements of the contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated. If the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at the initial conversion price of $21.60.  

 The Companys agreement with Marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. The future minimum contractual payments in the table above include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of $35,000 payable to Marvel that are contingent upon the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 4 which the Company currently expects to be paid in 2012. In addition, in connection with the extension of the Marvel license in 2009, the Company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling $140,000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next five to six years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases.  

 In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $5,100 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International pension plans in 2010. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $135,277 at December 27, 2009.  

 The Company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization program will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations described above.  

 Financial Risk Management  

 The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.  

 To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $44,200 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions.  

 The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.   

 40   
 The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 27, 2009, these contracts had unrealized gains of $22,548, of which $8,839 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $13,709 are recorded in other assets. Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December 27, 2009 are deferred gains of $20,410, net of tax, related to these derivatives.  

 At December 27, 2009, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $1,134,723. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company entered into several interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $400,000, to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long-term debt. At December 27, 2009, the fair value of these contracts was a liability of $2,725, which is included in other liabilities, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to decrease long-term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately $55,100 or $50,800, respectively. A hypothetical one-quarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease both 2009 pretax earnings and cash flows by $189.  

 The Economy and Inflation   

 The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 54% of its consolidated net revenues in 2009 and 52% of its consolidated net revenues in 2008 and 2007. In the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

 The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2009, approximately 65% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration may be less in years where the Company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year. In 2009 the Company had products related to the mid-year major motion picture releases of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE. In 2008 the Company had products related to the mid-year major motion picture releases of IRON MAN, THE INCREDIBLE HULK and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas.  

 Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys future revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.   

 41   
 The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2009 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

 New Accounting Pronouncements  

 In June 2009 the FASB revised accounting standards related to the transfer of financial assets. These revisions seek to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. These revisions also eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, and require such entities to be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. The requirements of these revised accounting standards are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2009. As a result of the adoption of these new accounting standards in 2010, the Company will account for all sales of accounts receivable under its securitization facility in 2010 as collateralized borrowings. The accounts receivable balances will remain on the Companys balance sheet and proceeds from the sales of the receivables will be recorded as short-term debt.  

 In June 2009 the FASB amended accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. These amendments require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The amended standards also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. At December 27, 2009, the Company has an ownership interest in one variable interest entity, the joint venture with Discovery. See the relevant discussion in note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Other than as discussed in note 5, the Company does not expect the adoption of the amended standards to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet or results of operations.  

 Other Information  

 The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
