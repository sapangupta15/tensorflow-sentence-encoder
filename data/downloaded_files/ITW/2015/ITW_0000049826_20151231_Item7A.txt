MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of its ongoing business operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company operates in the U.S. and 56 foreign countries. The initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the U.S. parent company. The Company’s products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. Therefore, the Company's manufacturing operations do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.

The Company designated €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 and €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $308 million and $158 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
