PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.5% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2017.

On July 17, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment comprised of (i) 37 office properties totaling over 11.1 million square feet, five multifamily properties with 3,133 units and five other assets totaling approximately 406,000 square feet and (ii) 18 future development assets totaling over 10.4 million square feet of estimated potential development density, and (iii) $412.5 million of cash ($275.0 million plus The Bartlett financing proceeds less transaction costs and other mortgage items) to JBG SMITH Properties ("JBGS"). On July 18, 2017, JBGS was combined with the management business and certain Washington, DC assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of JBGS. Mitchell Schear, former President of our Washington, DC business, is a member of the Board of Trustees of JBGS. We are providing transition services to JBGS initially including information technology, financial reporting and payroll services. The spin-off was effected through a tax-free distribution by Vornado to the holders of Vornado common shares of all of the common shares of JBGS at the rate of one JBGS common share for every two common shares of Vornado and the distribution by the Operating Partnership to the holders of its common units of all of the outstanding common units of JBG SMITH Properties LP (“JBGSLP”) at the rate of one JBGSLP common unit for every two common units of VRLP held of record. See JBGS’ Amendment No. 3 on Form 10 (File No. 1-37994) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2017 for additional information. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the historical financial results of our Washington, DC segment are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through:

•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.
