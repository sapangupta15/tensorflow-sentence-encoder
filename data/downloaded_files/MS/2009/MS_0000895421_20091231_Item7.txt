Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Introduction.  

Morgan Stanley (or the Company), a financial holding company, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segmentsInstitutional Securities, Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management. The Company, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. A summary of the activities of each of the business segments is as follows.  

Institutional Securities includes capital raising; financial advisory services, including advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance; corporate lending; sales, trading, financing and market-making activities in equity and fixed income securities and related products, including foreign exchange and commodities; and investment activities.  

Global Wealth Management Group, which includes the Companys 51% interest in MSSB (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), provides brokerage and investment advisory services to individual investors and small-to-medium sized businesses and institutions covering various investment alternatives; financial and wealth planning services; annuity and other insurance products; credit and other lending products; cash management services; retirement services; and trust and fiduciary services.

Asset Management also engages in investment activities.  

Change in Fiscal Year-End.  

On December 16, 2008, the Board approved a change in the Companys fiscal year-end from November 30 to December 31 of each year. This change to the calendar year reporting cycle began January 1, 2009. As a result of the change, the Company had a one-month transition period in December 2008.  

The Companys results of operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 (2009), November 30, 2008 (fiscal 2008), November 30, 2007 (fiscal 2007) and the one month ended December 31, 2008 are discussed below.  

Discontinued Operations.  

Retail Asset Management Business. On October 19, 2009, as part of a restructuring of its Asset Management business segment, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of Retail Asset Management, including Van Kampen Investments, Inc. (Van Kampen) to Invesco. This transaction allows the Companys Asset Management business segment to focus on its institutional client base, including corporations, pension plans, large intermediaries, foundations and endowments, sovereign wealth funds and central banks, among others.  

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Invesco will purchase substantially all of Retail Asset Management, operating under both the Morgan Stanley and Van Kampen brands, in a stock and cash transaction. The Company will receive a 9.4% minority interest in Invesco. The transaction, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is expected to close in mid-2010, subject to customary regulatory, client and fund shareholder approvals. The results of Retail Asset Management are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

(Quilter), Global Wealth Management Groups former mass affluent business in the United Kingdom (U.K.), are also reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented through its sale to Citigroup Inc. (Citi) on February 28, 2007. Citi subsequently contributed Quilter to the MSSB joint venture.

 N/M  Not Meaningful.  

 N/A  Not Applicable.  

 (1) Information includes MSSB effective from May 31, 2009 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 (2) Certain prior-period information has been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.  

 (3) Amounts include operating results and gains on secondary offerings related to MSCI, operating results and gains (losses) related to the disposition of Crescent, operating results of Retail Asset Management and other discontinued operations.  

 (4) For the calculation of basic and diluted EPS, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (5) Regional net revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were negatively impacted by the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, in 2009. Regional net revenues reflect the regional view of the Companys consolidated net revenues, on a managed basis, based on the following methodology:  

   Institutional Securities: advisory and equity underwritingclient location; debt underwritingrevenue recording location; sales and tradingtrading desk location. Global Wealth Management Group: global representative location. Asset Management: client location, except for the merchant banking business, which is based on asset location.  

 (6) The computation of average common equity for each business segment is based upon an economic capital framework that estimates the amount of equity capital required to support the businesses over a wide range of market environments while simultaneously satisfying regulatory, rating agency and investor requirements. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment based on a regulatory capital framework plus additional capital for stress losses. Economic capital requirements are met by regulatory Tier 1 equity (including Morgan Stanley shareholders equity, certain preferred stock, eligible hybrid capital instruments, non-controlling interests and deductions of certain goodwill, intangible assets, net deferred tax assets and debt valuation adjustment (DVA)), subject to regulatory limits. The economic capital framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. The effective tax rates used in the computation of business segment return on average common equity were determined on a separate entity basis.  

 (7) Book value per common share equals common shareholders equity of $37,091 million as of December 31, 2009, $31,676 million as of November 30, 2008, $30,169 million as of November 30, 2007 and $29,585 million as of December 31, 2008, divided by common shares outstanding of 1,361 million as of December 31, 2009, 1,048 million as of November 30, 2008, 1,056 million as of November 30, 2007 and 1,074 million as of December 31, 2008.  

 (8) Tangible common equity equals common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights. The deduction for goodwill and intangible assets in 2009 includes only the Companys share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets.  

39  

Table of Contents 

 (9) Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding.  

 (10) Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets (RWAs) ratio equals tangible common equity divided by total RWAs of $305,000 million at December 31, 2009.  

 (11) The effective tax rate for 2009 includes a tax benefit of $331 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, resulting from the cost of anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates. Excluding this benefit, the annual effective tax rate for 2009 would have been a benefit of 1%.  

 (12) Worldwide employees as of December 31, 2009 include additional worldwide employees of businesses contributed by Citi related to MSSB.  

 (13) For a discussion of average liquidity, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity Management PoliciesLiquidity Reserves herein.  

 (14) For a discussion of total capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory Requirements herein. For a discussion of Tier 1 common ratio, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Balance Sheet herein.  

 (15) Amount excludes certain asset management businesses following the decision to sell the Retail Asset Management business to Invesco.  

 (16) Equity and fixed income amounts include assets under management or supervision associated with the Asset Management and Global Wealth Management Group business segments. Other amounts include assets under management or supervision associated with the Global Wealth Management Group business segment.  

 (17) Amounts reported for Alternatives reflect the Companys invested equity in those funds and include a range of alternative investment products such as hedge funds, funds of hedge funds and funds of private equity funds.  

 (18) Revenues and expenses associated with these assets are included in the Companys Asset Management and Global Wealth Management Group business segments.  

 (19) Amounts include Asset Managements proportional share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a non-controlling interest.  

 (20) Percentages represent income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.  

 (21) Global representatives as of December 31, 2009 include additional global representatives of businesses contributed by Citi related to MSSB.  

 (22) Annualized net revenue per global representative for 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the one month ended December 31, 2008 equals Global Wealth Management Groups net revenues (excluding the sale of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management S.V., S.A.U. (MSWM S.V.) for fiscal 2008) divided by the quarterly weighted average global representative headcount for 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  

 (23) Beginning in 2009, amounts for Corporate and other accounts are presented in the appropriate client segment.  

 (24) Client assets per global representative equal total period-end client assets divided by period-end global representative headcount.  

 (25) Approximately $54 billion of the bank deposit balances as of December 31, 2009 are held at Company-affiliated depositories with the remainder held at Citi-affiliated depositories. These deposit balances are held at certain of the Companys Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) insured depository institutions for the benefit of retail clients through their accounts.  

 (26) Source: Lipper, one-year performance excluding money market funds as of December 31, 2009, November 30, 2008, November 30, 2007 and December 31, 2008, respectively, excluding Retail Asset Management.  

Global Market and Economic Conditions in 2009.  

During 2009, global market and economic conditions improved, and global capital markets recovered from the severe downturn that occurred during the Fall of 2008.  

In the U.S., economic conditions improved, liquidity began to return to the fixed income markets, the initial public offering market reopened and the securitization market began to reopen, while the real estate markets continued to be adversely impacted. Major U.S. equity market indices ended 2009 higher as compared with the beginning of the year, primarily due to better than expected corporate earnings and investor confidence in an economic recovery. Government spending increased, while consumer spending, household balance sheets and business spending remained challenged. The unemployment rate increased to 10.0% at December 31, 2009 from 7.4% at December 31, 2008. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept its interest rates at historically low levels, and at December 31, 2009, the federal funds target rate was between zero and 0.25%, and the discount rate was 0.50%. During 2009, the interest rate on required reserve balances and on excess balances (balances held to satisfy reserve requirements and balances held in excess of required reserve requirements) was 0.25%. During 2009, the FOMC pursued a quantitative easing policy in which the FOMC purchased securities with the objective of improving conditions within the credit markets by increasing the money supply. In February 2010, the FOMC raised the discount rate by 0.25% to 0.75%.  

In Europe, major European equity market indices ended 2009 higher as compared with the beginning of the year. Economic conditions, however, continued to be challenged by adverse economic developments that began in the Fall of 2008. The euro area unemployment rate increased to 10.0% at December 31, 2009 from 8.2% at December 2008. During the first half of 2009, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its benchmark  

40  

Table of Contents 

 interest rate by 1.50% to a record low of 1.00%, and during the second half of 2009, the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged. During the first half of 2009, the Bank of England (BOE) lowered its benchmark interest rate by 1.50% to 0.50%, and during the second half of 2009, the BOE left its benchmark interest rate unchanged. During 2009, the BOE pursued a quantitative easing policy in which the BOE purchased securities, including U.K. Government Gilts, with the objective of increasing the money supply.  

In Asia, economic conditions continued to be challenged by adverse economic developments that began in the Fall of 2008, including a decline in exports in both China and Japan. Despite lower exports, Chinas economy continued to benefit from government spending for capital projects. Equity markets in both China and Japan ended 2009 higher, as compared with the beginning of the year. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) pursued a quantitative easing policy in which the BOJ would purchase securities with the objective of increasing liquidity and reducing the reliance on short-term liquidity by providing longer term liquidity via Japanese government bond purchases.  

Overview of 2009 Financial Results Compared with Fiscal 2008.   

The Company recorded net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $1,346 million in 2009, a 21% decrease from $1,707 million in fiscal 2008. Comparisons of the 2009 results with fiscal 2008 were impacted by seven months results of MSSB, which closed on May 31, 2009.  

Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense) increased 6% to $23,358 million in 2009. Net revenues included losses of approximately $5,510 million in 2009 related to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long-term and short-term borrowings accounted for at fair value compared with gains of $5,594 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings. Net interest revenues were $990 million in 2009 as compared with $3,367 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment coupled with a lower average mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including lower client balances in the Companys prime brokerage business. Net revenues in 2009 also included a gain of $319 million related to the sale of undivided participating interests in a portion of the Companys claims against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection. Non-interest expenses increased 7% to $22,501 million in 2009, primarily due to higher compensation costs, partly offset by lower non-compensation costs. Compensation and benefits expense increased 21%, primarily reflecting the consolidation of MSSB. Non-compensation expenses decreased 11%, primarily due to the Companys initiatives to reduce costs, lower levels of business activity and non-cash charges of $725 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional operating costs and integration costs related to MSSB. Results included in discontinued operations for 2009 reflected the pre-tax net gain of $625 million related to the sale of the Companys remaining ownership interest in MSCI and the disposition of Crescent (see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements). Diluted EPS were $(0.77) in 2009 compared with $1.39 in fiscal 2008. Diluted EPS from continuing operations were $(0.93) in 2009 compared with $0.88 in fiscal 2008. Due to the Companys repurchase of its Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series D Preferred Stock), the Company incurred a negative adjustment of $850 million in its calculation of basic and diluted EPS (reduction to earnings (losses) applicable to the Companys common shareholders) for 2009 due to the accelerated amortization of the issuance discount on the Series D Preferred Stock.  

The Companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was a benefit of 39% in 2009. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $331 million in 2009, resulting from the cost of anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates. Excluding this benefit, the annual effective tax rate in 2009 would have been a benefit of 1%. The annual effective tax rate in 2009 is reflective of the geographic mix of earnings and includes tax benefits associated with the anticipated use of domestic tax credits and the utilization of state net operating losses.  

The results for fiscal 2008 included a pre-tax gain of $687 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V., the Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).

The Companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was a benefit of 2% in fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 is reflective of the geographic mix of earnings and includes tax benefits associated with domestic tax credits and tax-exempt income and tax charges associated with nondeductible goodwill impairment charges.  

Overview of 2009 Segment Results Compared with Fiscal 2008.  

Institutional Securities. Institutional Securities recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes of $982 million in 2009, a 31% decrease from fiscal 2008.  

Net revenues decreased 13% to $12,777 million in 2009, which reflected losses of approximately $5,421 million resulting from the tightening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long-term and short-term borrowings accounted for at fair value compared with gains of $5,515 million resulting from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings in fiscal 2008. In addition, 2009 reflected higher net revenues from investment banking.  

Investment banking revenues increased 23% to $4,454 million from fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher revenues from underwriting transactions, partially offset by lower advisory fees. Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,488 million, a decrease of 14% from fiscal 2008. Underwriting revenues increased 57% from fiscal 2008 reflecting higher levels of market activity.  

Equity sales and trading revenues decreased 66% to $3,353 million in 2009 from fiscal 2008. The decline in 2009 was primarily due to lower net revenues from derivative products and equity cash products, reflecting lower levels of market volume and market volatility, and lower average prime brokerage client balances. Equity sales and trading revenues were also negatively impacted by losses of $1,738 million in 2009 due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings accounted for at fair value compared with a benefit of approximately $1,604 million in fiscal 2008 due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 30% to $5,017 million in 2009 from $3,862 million in fiscal 2008. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were negatively impacted by losses of approximately $3,321 million from the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings accounted for at fair value compared with a benefit of approximately $3,524 million in fiscal 2008 due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings. Results for 2009 also reflected lower revenues from commodities. Results in 2009 included a net gain of $319 million related to the sale of undivided participating interests in a portion of the Companys claims against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection.  

In 2009, other sales and trading net revenues reflected net gains of $183 million compared with net losses of $3,109 million in fiscal 2008. Results for 2009 included net gains of $804 million (mark-to-market valuations and realized gains of $4,042 million, partially offset by losses on related hedges of $3,238 million) associated with loans and lending commitments compared with net losses of $3,335 million (negative mark-to-market valuations and losses of $6,311 million, net of gains on related hedges of $2,976 million) in fiscal 2008. Results in 2009 also included losses of $362 million, reflecting the improvement in the Companys debt-related credit spreads on certain debt related to China Investment Corporation Ltd.s (CIC) investment in the Company compared with gains of $387 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 included losses related to mortgage-related securities portfolios in the Companys domestic subsidiary banks, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Trust (collectively, the Subsidiary Banks), and mark-to-market gains on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long-term debt.  

Principal transactions net investment losses aggregating $875 million were recognized in 2009 as compared with net investment losses aggregating $2,478 million in fiscal 2008.

Table of Contents 

Non-interest expenses decreased 11% to $11,795 million, primarily due to lower non-compensation costs. Non-compensation expenses decreased 26%, resulting from the Companys initiatives to reduce costs and a charge of approximately $694 million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to certain fixed income businesses recorded in fiscal 2008.  

Global Wealth Management Group. Global Wealth Management Group recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes of $559 million compared with $1,154 million in fiscal 2008. The current year included seven months of operating results for MSSB, which closed on May 31, 2009. Fiscal 2008 included a pre-tax gain of $687 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V. Fiscal 2008 also included a charge of $532 million associated with the Auction Rate Securities (ARS) repurchase program and $108 million associated with subsequent writedowns of some of these securities that were repurchased (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Net revenues were $9,390 million, a 34% increase over fiscal 2008, primarily related to higher revenues from asset management, distribution and administration fees, higher commission revenues, higher revenues from principal transactions trading activities, higher investment banking revenues and the consolidation of MSSB, partially offset by lower net interest. Client assets in fee-based accounts increased 175% to $379 billion and decreased as a percentage of total client assets to 24% compared with 25% as of December 31, 2008. In addition, total client assets rose to $1,560 billion from $550 billion as of December 31, 2008, primarily due to the consolidation of MSSB.  

Total non-interest expenses were $8,831 million, a 51% increase from fiscal 2008. Compensation and benefits expense increased 60% in 2009, primarily due to the consolidation of MSSB. Non-compensation costs increased 32%, primarily due to the operating costs of MSSB, the amortization of MSSBs intangible assets and integration costs for MSSB. As a result of the MSSB transaction, the number of global representatives increased 117% to 18,135 at December 31, 2009 from 8,356 at December 31, 2008.  

Asset Management. Asset Management recorded a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $673 million in 2009 compared with a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $1,423 million in fiscal 2008. Net revenues of $1,337 million in 2009 increased 144% from fiscal 2008 due to higher revenues in the core businesses, which include traditional equity and fixed income funds, hedge funds and fund of funds, in addition to lower losses in the merchant banking business. The increase in 2009 primarily reflected lower principal investment losses, partially offset by lower asset management, distribution and administrative fees, primarily reflecting lower average assets under management. The results in 2009 also reflected losses related to certain real estate funds sponsored and consolidated by the Company. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management were $266 billion at December 31, 2009, down from $290 billion at December 31, 2008, a decrease of 8%, reflecting net customer outflows of $41.1 billion, primarily in the Companys money market, long-term fixed income and equity funds. Non-interest expenses increased 2% from fiscal 2008 to $2,010 million. Compensation and benefits expense increased 17%, primarily due to higher net revenues.  

Overview of the one month ended December 31, 2008 Financial Results.  

The Company recorded a net loss applicable to Morgan Stanley of $1,288 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008 compared with net income of $626 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007.

Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations.  

The Companys results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors. In addition, results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including the effect of political and economic conditions and geopolitical events; the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income and credit markets, including corporate and mortgage (commercial and residential) lending and commercial real estate investments; the impact of current, pending and future legislation, regulation, and legal actions in the U.S. and worldwide; the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices, and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; the availability and cost of both credit and capital as well as the credit ratings assigned to the Companys unsecured short-term and long-term debt; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; the Companys reputation; the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors; and technological changes. Such factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect the Companys business, see Competition and Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1, and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.  

Results of Operations.  

The following items significantly affected the Companys results of operations in 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008.  

Morgan Stanley Debt. Net revenues reflected (losses) gains from the (tightening) widening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long-term and short-term borrowings, including structured notes and junior subordinated debentures, that are accounted for at fair value as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition, in 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded gains of approximately $491 million, $2.3 billion and $73 million, respectively, from repurchasing its debt in the open market. In fiscal 2008, the Company also recorded mark-to-market gains of approximately $1.4 billion on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long-term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company (i.e., the swaps were de-designated as hedges). During the period the swaps were hedging the debt, changes in fair value of these instruments were generally offset by adjustments to the basis of the debt being hedged.

Monoline insurers (Monolines) provide credit enhancement to capital markets transactions. 2009 included losses of $231 million related to Monoline credit exposures as compared with losses of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008 and losses of $203 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008. The current credit environment continued to affect the capacity of such financial guarantors. The Companys direct exposure to Monolines is limited to bonds that are insured by Monolines and to derivative contracts with a Monoline as counterparty (principally MBIA Inc.). The Companys exposure to Monolines as of December 31, 2009 consisted primarily of asset-backed securities bonds of approximately $458 million in the portfolio of the Companys

 Subsidiary Banks that are collateralized primarily by first and second lien subprime mortgages enhanced by financial guarantees, approximately $2.0 billion in insured municipal bond securities and approximately $651 million in net counterparty exposure (gross exposure of approximately $5.4 billion net of cumulative credit valuation adjustments of approximately $2.8 billion and net of hedges). Net counterparty exposure is defined as potential loss to the Company over a period of time in an event of 100% default of a Monoline, assuming zero recovery. The Companys hedging program for Monoline risk includes the use of transactions that effectively mitigate certain market risk components of existing underlying transactions with the Monolines.  

MSSB. During 2009, the Company recorded deal closing costs of $221 million and integration costs of $280 million. Deal closing costs include a one-time expense of $124 million primarily for replacement of deferred compensation awards for MSSB retirement-eligible employees. The costs of these replacement awards were fully allocated to Citi.  

Structured Investment Vehicles. The Company recognized net gains of $164 million in 2009 and losses of $470 million and $84 million in fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively, related to securities issued by structured investment vehicles (SIV). The Company no longer has any SIV positions on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2009.  

Income Tax Benefit. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $331 million in 2009 resulting from the cost of anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates. 

Goodwill and Intangibles. Impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets were $16 million in 2009 and $725 million for fiscal 2008 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Subsidiary Banks. The Company recorded gains of approximately $140 million in 2009 and losses of approximately $900 million in fiscal 2008 related to mortgage-related securities portfolios of the Subsidiary Banks.  

ARS. Under the terms of various agreements entered into with government agencies and the terms of the Companys announced offer to repurchase, the Company agreed to repurchase at par certain ARS held by retail clients that were purchased through the Company. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse retail clients who have sold certain ARS purchased through the Company at a loss. Fiscal 2008 reflected charges of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program and writedowns of $108 million associated with ARS held in inventory (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Sales of Subsidiaries and Other Items. Results for fiscal 2008 included a pre-tax gain of $687 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V.  

Equity Capital-Related Transactions.  

During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into several capital-related transactions. Such transactions included the sale of equity units (the Equity Units) to a wholly owned subsidiary of CIC for approximately $5.6 billion and the issuance to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) of shares of Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) and shares of Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series C Preferred Stock) for a total of $9 billion. In addition, the Company, as part of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), issued to the U.S. Treasury 10,000,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase 65,245,759 shares of the Companys common stock (the Warrant) for a purchase price of $10 billion.  

In June 2009, the Company repurchased the 10,000,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock from the U.S. Treasury at the liquidation preference amount plus accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate repurchase price of $10,086 million. As a result of the Companys repurchase of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Company incurred a one-time negative adjustment of $850 million in its calculation of basic and diluted EPS (reduction to earnings (losses) applicable to the Companys common shareholders) for 2009 due to the accelerated amortization of the issuance discount on the Series D Preferred Stock.

Table of Contents 

In August 2009, under the terms of the CPP securities purchase agreement, the Company repurchased the Warrant from the U.S. Treasury for $950 million. The repurchase of the Series D Preferred Stock in the amount of $10.0 billion and the Warrant for $950 million reduced the Companys total equity by $10,950 million in 2009.  

In addition, during 2009, the Company issued common stock for approximately $6.9 billion in two registered public offerings in May and June 2009. MUFG elected to participate in both offerings, and in one of the offerings, MUFG received $0.7 billion of common stock in exchange for 640,909 shares of the Companys Series C Preferred Stock.  

See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these capital-related transactions.  

Business Segments.  

Substantially all of the Companys operating revenues and operating expenses can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures.  

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations primarily represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by the Asset Management business segment to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to the Global Wealth Management Group business segments global representatives. Intersegment eliminations also reflect the effect of fees paid by the Institutional Securities business segment to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment related to the bank deposit program. Losses before income taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations were $11 million, $17 million, $84 million and $1 million in 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.

Other Financial Information.  

Investment Banking.  

Investment banking revenues were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans.  

Sales and Trading.  

Sales and trading revenues were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transactions trading revenues, commissions and net interest revenues (expenses). In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views principal trading, commissions and net interest revenues (expenses) in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions, and other related expenses.  

The components of the Companys sales and trading revenues are as follows:  

Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transactionstrading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions, as well as proprietary trading activities for its own account.  

Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over-the-counter (OTC) equity securities and options.  

Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Certain reverse

 repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions.  

Sales and trading revenues by business were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) All prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.  

 (2) Other sales and trading net revenues primarily include net gains (losses) from loans and lending commitments and related hedges associated with the Companys lending and other corporate activities.  

2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008  

Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues increased 23% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, as higher revenues from equity and fixed income underwriting transactions were partially offset by lower advisory revenues. In 2009, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,488 million, a decrease of 14% from fiscal 2008, reflecting lower levels of market activity. Underwriting revenues of $2,966 million increased 57% from fiscal 2008, reflecting higher levels of market activity, as equity underwriting revenues increased 62% to $1,694 million and fixed income underwriting revenues increased 51% to $1,272 million. Underwriting fees in 2009 reflected a significant increase in market activity from 2008 levels, which were affected by unprecedented market turmoil and challenging market conditions.  

Sales and Trading Revenues. Total sales and trading revenues decreased 20% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, reflecting lower equity sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher other sales and trading revenues and by higher fixed income sales and trading revenues.  

Equity. Equity sales and trading revenues decreased 66% to $3,353 million in 2009 from fiscal 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to a significant reduction in net revenues from derivative products and equity cash products, reflecting lower levels of market volume and market volatility, reduced levels of client activity and lower average prime brokerage client balances. Equity sales and trading revenues reflected losses of $1,738 million due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads during 2009 resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected, compared with a benefit of approximately $1,604 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit spreads.  

In 2009, equity sales and trading revenues also reflected unrealized gains of approximately $198 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of the counterparties credit default spreads compared with losses of $300 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the counterparties credit default spreads. The Company also recorded unrealized losses of approximately $154 million in 2009 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of the Companys credit default swap spreads compared with gains of $125 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized losses and gains do not reflect any gains or losses on related non-derivative hedging instruments.

Table of Contents 

Fixed Income. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased $1,155 million to $5,017 million in 2009 from $3,862 million in fiscal 2008. Interest rate, currency and credit products net revenues increased 145% in 2009 primarily due to strong investment grade and distressed debt trading results, partly offset by lower levels of client activity. Results in 2009 also included a gain of $319 million related to the sale of undivided participating interests in a portion of the Companys claims against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection. Commodity net revenues decreased 31% in 2009, primarily reflecting reduced levels of client activity and unfavorable market conditions.  

In 2009, fixed income sales and trading revenues reflected net unrealized gains of approximately $3,462 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of the counterparties credit default spreads compared with unrealized losses of approximately $6,560 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the counterparties credit default spreads. The Company also recorded unrealized losses of approximately $1,938 million in 2009, related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of the Companys credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized gains of approximately $1,968 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized losses and gains on credit default spreads do not reflect any gains or losses on related non-derivative hedging instruments.  

In addition, fixed income sales and trading revenues in 2009 were negatively impacted by losses of approximately $3,321 million from the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected. Fiscal 2008 reflected a benefit of approximately $3,524 million due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings.  

Other. In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues included other trading revenues, consisting primarily of certain activities associated with the Companys corporate lending activities. In connection with its corporate lending activities, the Company provides to select clients loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) that are generally classified as either event-driven or relationship-driven. Event-driven loans and lending commitments refer to activities associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition or recapitalization transactions. Relationship-driven loans and lending commitments are generally made to expand business relationships with select clients. For further information about the Companys corporate lending activities, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk herein. The fair value measurement of loans and lending commitments takes into account certain fee income that is attributable to the contingent commitment contract.  

In 2009, other sales and trading net revenues reflected net gains of $183 million compared with net losses of $3,109 million in fiscal 2008. Results for 2009 included net gains of $804 million (mark-to-market valuations and realized gains of $4,042 million, partially offset by losses on related hedges of $3,238 million) associated with loans and lending commitments. Results for fiscal 2008 included net losses of $3,335 million (negative mark-to-market valuations and losses of $6,311 million, net of gains on related hedges of $2,976 million) associated with loans and lending commitments largely related to certain event-driven lending to non-investment grade companies. The valuation of these commitments could change in future periods depending on, among other things, the extent that they are renegotiated or repriced or if the associated acquisition transaction does not occur. Results in 2009 also included losses of $362 million, reflecting the improvement in the Companys debt-related credit spreads on certain debt related to CICs investment in the Company compared with gains of $387 million in fiscal 2008.  

In fiscal 2008, other sales and trading revenues also included writedowns of securities of approximately $1.2 billion in the Companys Subsidiary Banks and mark-to-market gains of approximately $1,352 million on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long-term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company (i.e., the swaps were de-designated as hedges). During the period in which the swaps were hedging the debt, changes in fair value of these instruments were generally offset by adjustments to the basis of the debt being hedged.

Principal TransactionsInvestments. The Companys investments generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.  

Principal transactions net investment losses of $875 million were recognized in 2009 as compared with net investment losses of $2,478 million in fiscal 2008. The losses were primarily related to net realized and unrealized losses from the Companys limited partnership investments in real estate funds and investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.  

Other. Other revenues decreased 80% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. During 2009, the Company recorded gains of approximately $465 million from the Companys repurchase of debt in the open market compared with approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2008 (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of OperationsMorgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion).  

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses decreased 11% in 2009, primarily due to lower non-compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased 1% from fiscal 2008. Non-compensation expenses decreased 26% in 2009, partly due to the Companys initiatives to reduce costs. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 11% in 2009, primarily due to lower leasing costs associated with office facilities. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 20% in 2009, primarily due to decreased trading activity. Marketing and business development expense decreased 43% in 2009, primarily due to lower levels of business activity. Professional services expense decreased 18% in 2009, primarily due to lower consulting and legal fees. Other expenses decreased 50% in 2009. In fiscal 2008, other expenses included $694 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to certain fixed income businesses. Excluding the fiscal 2008 impairment charges, other expenses decreased in 2009, primarily due to lower levels of business activity and lower litigation expense.  

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007  

Investment banking revenues decreased 34% in fiscal 2008, reflecting the unprecedented market turmoil that significantly reduced levels of market activity. Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,740 million, a decrease of 32% from fiscal 2007. Advisory fees in fiscal 2008 reflected lower levels of activity due to the challenging market environment. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 33% to $1,045 million in fiscal 2008, reflecting significantly lower levels of market activity, particularly for initial public offerings. Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 41% to $845 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 revenues were impacted by significantly lower levels of market activity across most products, particularly loan syndications and securitized products.  

Total sales and trading revenues increased 33% in fiscal 2008. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 10% to $9,968 million in fiscal 2008 and reflected higher net revenues from derivative products and slightly higher results in prime brokerage. Equity sales and trading revenues also benefited from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value, including, but not limited to, those for which the fair value option was elected. As previously mentioned, equity sales and trading revenues in fiscal 2008 reflected approximately $1,604 million due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads. Revenues from derivative products reflected higher customer flows and high levels of volatility. Principal trading strategies reflected significantly lower revenues in fiscal 2008 as the Company exited select proprietary trading strategies. Although prime brokerage revenues increased in fiscal 2008, in the fourth quarter, the Companys prime brokerage business experienced significant outflows as clients withdrew their cash balances and reallocated positions. These outflows have had a negative impact on prime brokerages operating results in fiscal 2008.  

Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased to $3,862 million in fiscal 2008 from $268 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 results included mortgage-related writedowns of $7.8 billion, reflecting the deterioration in the value of U.S. subprime trading positions, principally super senior derivative positions in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) entered into primarily by the Companys mortgage proprietary trading group. Fiscal 2008 results reflected lower losses in mortgage loan products, higher revenues from commodities, higher revenues

 from foreign exchange products, partially offset by lower net revenues from the interest rate and credit businesses. Interest rate, currency and credit products revenues decreased 55% in fiscal 2008. Continued dislocation in the credit markets resulted in lower net revenues from credit products, including losses of $1,686 million related to exposure to Monolines and unfavorable positioning, partially offset by higher revenues from foreign exchange products and strong results in interest rate products. Interest rate, currency and credit products revenues for fiscal 2008 benefited by $171 million due to the reversal of prior-period valuation adjustments related to interest rate derivatives, partially offset by a cumulative negative adjustment of $120 million related to prior-period incorrect valuations of a London-based traders positions (see Notes 21 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements for further information). Results in foreign exchange products were primarily due to higher levels of customer flows and market volatility. Mortgage-related losses of approximately $1.7 billion were primarily due to a broadening decline in the residential and commercial mortgage sector. The decline in the Companys mortgage loan product activities reflected the difficult credit market conditions in fiscal 2008. Commodity revenues increased 62%, primarily due to higher revenues from oil liquids and electricity and natural gas products, reflecting higher market volatility and strong customer flow. As previously mentioned, fixed income sales and trading revenues also benefited in fiscal 2008 by approximately $3,524 million from the widening of the Companys credit spreads.  

In fiscal 2008, other sales and trading losses were approximately $3,109 million compared with $1,246 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 reflected net losses of $3,335 million (negative mark-to-market valuations and losses of $6,311 million, net of gains on related hedges of $2,976 million) associated with loans and lending commitments largely related to certain event-driven lending to non-investment grade companies, writedowns of securities of approximately $1.2 billion in the Companys Subsidiary Banks and mark-to-market gains of approximately $1,352 million on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long-term debt.  

In fiscal 2007, other sales and trading losses primarily reflected approximately $700 million of mark-to-market valuations associated with loans and commitments largely related to event-driven lending to non-investment grade companies and the impairment charge related to securities in the Companys Subsidiary Banks.  

Principal transactions net investment losses aggregating $2,478 million were recognized in fiscal 2008 as compared with net investment gains aggregating $1,458 million in fiscal 2007. The losses in fiscal 2008 were primarily related to net realized and unrealized losses from the Companys investments in passive limited partnership interests associated with the Companys real estate funds and investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans and other principal investments. Fiscal 2007s results primarily related to realized and unrealized net gains associated with certain of the Companys investments.  

Other revenues increased 379% in fiscal 2008. The increase reflected revenues related to Institutional Securities share (approximately $2,135 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt. Fiscal 2008 also included a gain associated with the sale of a controlling interest in a previously consolidated commodities subsidiary.  

Non-interest expenses decreased 12% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 29%, primarily reflecting lower incentive-based compensation accruals due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by severance-related expenses of $653 million in fiscal 2008. Non-compensation expenses increased 23% in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 results included a charge of approximately $694 million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to certain fixed income businesses (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements), and fiscal 2007s results included a reversal of the $360 million legal accrual related to the Companys favorable outcome from the Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. (Coleman) litigation. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 27%, primarily due to higher depreciation expense on property and equipment and higher costs associated with exiting certain property lease agreements. Information processing and communications expense increased 4% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher data processing costs and market data. Marketing and business development expense decreased 7%, primarily due to lower levels of business activity. Other expenses increased 151%, reflecting the previously mentioned charge of approximately $694 million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and the $360 million reversal of the Coleman litigation reserve in fiscal 2007 as previously mentioned, partially offset by lower minority interest.

GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP  

INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On May 31, 2009, MSSB was formed (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information). The Company owns 51% of MSSB, which is consolidated. As a result, the operating results for MSSB are included in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment since May 31, 2009. Net income applicable to non-controlling interests of $98 million in 2009 primarily represents Citis interest in MSSB.  

2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008  

Investment Banking. Global Wealth Management Group investment banking includes revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. Investment banking revenues increased 40% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, primarily due to the consolidation of MSSB and higher equity underwriting activity, partially offset by lower underwriting activity across fixed income and unit trust products.

Table of Contents 

Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transactionstrading include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys inventory positions held, primarily to facilitate customer transactions.  

Principal transactions trading revenues increased 97% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, primarily due to the consolidation of the operating revenues of MSSB, and higher revenues from municipal and corporate fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from government securities. The results in 2009 also reflected net gains associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans.  

Principal TransactionsInvestments. Principal transactions net investment gains were $3 million in 2009 compared with net investment losses of $54 million in fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 primarily reflected net gains associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with losses on such plans in fiscal 2008.  

Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commission revenues increased 48% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, reflecting the operating results of MSSB, partially offset by lower client activity.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from individual investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management, account services and administration. The Company also receives shareholder servicing fees and fees for services it provides in distributing certain open-ended mutual funds and other products. Mutual fund distribution fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 68% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to consolidating the operating revenues of MSSB and fees associated with customer account balances in the bank deposit program. Beginning in June 2009, revenues in the bank deposit program are primarily included in Asset management, distribution and administration fees prospectively. These revenues were previously reported in Interest and dividends revenues. This change is the result of agreements that were entered into in connection with the MSSB transaction.  

Balances in the bank deposit program rose to $112.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 from $38.8 billion as of December 31, 2008, primarily due to MSSB, which include balances held at Citis depository institutions. Deposits held by certain of the Companys FDIC-insured depository institutions were $54 billion of the $112.5 billion deposits at December 31, 2009.  

Client assets in fee-based accounts increased 175% to $379 billion as of December 31, 2009 and represented 24% of total client assets compared with 25% as of December 31, 2008. Total client asset balances increased to $1,560 billion as of December 31, 2009 from $550 billion as of December 31, 2008, primarily due to MSSB. Client asset balances in households greater than $1 million increased to $1,090 billion as of December 31, 2009 from $354 billion as of December 31, 2008.  

Other. Other revenues primarily include customer account service fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues decreased 74% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 included the operating revenues of MSSB. Fiscal 2008 results included $743 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V., the Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business, and Global Wealth Management Groups share ($43 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of OperationsMorgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion).  

Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including customer bank deposits and margin loans and securities borrowed and securities

Table of Contents 

 loaned transactions. Net interest revenues decreased 29% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the change in classification of the bank deposit program noted above, a decline in customer margin loan balances and increased funding costs.  

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased 51% in 2009 and included the operating costs of MSSB, the amortization of MSSBs intangible assets, and deal closing costs of $221 million and integration costs of $280 million for MSSB. Deal closing costs included a one-time expense of $124 million primarily for replacement deferred compensation awards. The cost of these replacement awards was fully allocated to Citi within non-controlling interests. Compensation and benefits expense increased 60% in 2009, primarily reflecting MSSB and the replacement awards noted above. Non-compensation expenses increased 32%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 91%, primarily due to the operating costs of MSSB and real estate abandonment charges. Information processing and communications expense increased 70% and professional services expense increased 54% in 2009, primarily due to the operating results of MSSB. Other expenses decreased 7% in 2009, primarily due to the charge of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program in fiscal 2008 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by operating costs of MSSB and a charge related to an FDIC assessment on deposits.  

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007  

Investment banking revenues decreased 32% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower underwriting activity across equity and unit trust products, partially offset by an increase in fixed income underwriting activity. Principal transactions trading revenues increased 3% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher revenues from municipal, corporate and government fixed income securities, partially offset by $108 million in writedowns on $3.8 billion of ARS repurchased from clients and previously held on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition and losses associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans. Principal transactions net investment losses were $54 million in fiscal 2008 compared with net investment gains of $29 million in fiscal 2007. The results in fiscal 2008 reflected net losses associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans. Commission revenues decreased 2% in fiscal 2008, reflecting lower client activity.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 11% in fiscal 2008. The decrease was driven by a change in the classification of sub-advisory fees due to modifications of certain customer agreements, the discontinuance of the Companys fee-based brokerage program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and asset depreciation. Client assets in fee-based accounts decreased 32% to $136 billion as of November 30, 2008 and represented 25% of total client assets versus 27% at November 30, 2007. Total client asset balances decreased to $546 billion as of November 30, 2008 from $758 billion as of November 30, 2007, primarily due to asset depreciation. Client asset balances in households greater than $1 million decreased to $349 billion as of November 30, 2008 from $522 billion at November 30, 2007.  

Net interest revenues increased 32%, primarily due to increased customer account balances in the bank deposit program. Balances in the bank deposit program rose to $36.4 billion as of November 30, 2008 from $26.2 billion at November 30, 2007. Other revenues were $965 million in fiscal 2008 and $163 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 included $743 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V. and Global Wealth Management Groups share ($43 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt.  

Non-interest expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting the charge of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program. Compensation and benefits expense remained flat in fiscal 2008, as severance-related expenses of $41 million and investment in the business were offset by lower incentive-based compensation accruals. Non-compensation expenses increased 25%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in space costs and branch renovations. Professional services expense decreased 40%, primarily due to the change in the classification of sub-advisory fees due to modifications of certain customer agreements and lower legal costs. Other expenses increased 206%, primarily resulting from the charge of $532 million related to ARS as previously mentioned and higher litigation costs.

One Month Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with the One Month Ended December 31, 2007  

Global Wealth Management Group recorded income before income taxes of $118 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008 compared with $103 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007. The one month ended December 31, 2008 included a reversal of a portion of approximately $70 million of the accrual related to the ARS repurchase program. Net revenues were $409 million, a 24% decrease, primarily related to lower asset management, distribution and administration fees, lower commissions and lower investment banking fees. Client assets in fee-based accounts decreased 31% to $138 billion and decreased as a percentage of total client assets to 25% from 27% at December 31, 2007. In addition, total client assets decreased to $550 billion, down 27% from December 31, 2007, primarily due to weakened market conditions.  

Total non-interest expenses were $291 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008, a 33% decrease from the prior period. Compensation and benefits expense was $247 million, a 21% decrease from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower revenues. Non-compensation costs decreased 65%, primarily due to a reversal of approximately $70 million of the accrual related to the ARS repurchase program.

2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008  

Investment Banking. Asset Management generates investment banking revenues primarily from the placement of investments in real estate funds. Investment banking revenues decreased 62% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting lower revenues from real estate products.  

Principal TransactionsTrading. In 2009, the Company recognized losses of $68 million compared with losses of $331 million in fiscal 2008. Trading results in 2009 included mark-to-market losses related to a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company and losses from hedges on certain investments and long-term debt. Losses in 2009 were partially offset by net gains of $164 million related to securities issued by SIVs compared with losses of $470 million in fiscal 2008.  

Principal TransactionsInvestments. Real estate and private equity investments generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.  

Principal transactions net investment losses of $182 million were recognized in 2009 compared with losses of $1,393 million in fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 were primarily related to net investment losses associated with  

61  

Table of Contents 

 the Companys real estate investments and losses associated with certain investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Losses in 2009 were partially offset by net investment gains associated with the Companys alternatives business.  

The results for 2009 also included operating losses of certain consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company. The Company consolidated the funds during 2009 after providing them with financial assistance and in light of the continued deterioration of equity in the funds. Earnings of these funds related to the limited partnership interests not owned by the Company are reported in Net income (loss) applicable to non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income.  

The results in fiscal 2008 were primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys merchant banking business, including real estate and private equity investments, and losses associated with certain investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Included in the net investment losses in fiscal 2008 were writedowns of approximately $250 million on Crescent prior to its consolidation.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues generated from the management and supervision of assets, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, and separately managed accounts and fees relating to the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds. Asset management fees arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees are earned on certain funds as a percentage of appreciation earned by those funds and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 25% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflected lower fund management and administration fees reflecting a decrease in average assets under management.  

Net flows in 2009 were associated with negative outflows across all asset classes. The Companys decline in assets under management from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 included net customer outflows of $41.1 billion, primarily in the Companys money market, long-term fixed income and equity funds.  

Other. Other revenues decreased 71% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 reflected lower revenues associated with Lansdowne Partners (Lansdowne), a London-based investment manager, in which the Company has a non-controlling interest, and lower revenues associated with the Companys repurchase of debt (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of OperationsMorgan Stanley Debt, herein).  

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased 2% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased 17% in 2009, primarily reflecting higher net revenues. Non-compensation expenses decreased 12% in 2009. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 44% in 2009, primarily due to lower fee sharing expenses. Marketing and business development expense decreased 40% in 2009, primarily due to lower levels of business activity. Professional services expense decreased 20% in 2009, primarily due to lower consulting and legal fees.  

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007  

Investment banking revenues decreased 88% in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting lower revenues from real estate products.

Table of Contents 

In fiscal 2008, the Company recognized principal transactions trading losses of $331 million, which included $470 million related to SIVs included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition, compared with losses of $129 million related to SIVs in fiscal 2007. These losses in fiscal 2008 were partially offset by net gains from hedges on certain investments.  

Principal transactions net investment losses aggregating $1,393 million were recognized in fiscal 2008 as compared with gains of $1,760 million in fiscal 2007. The results for fiscal 2008 are discussed above in 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008Principal TransactionsInvestments. The results in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by investments associated with the Companys real estate products and private equity portfolio, including employee deferred compensation plans and co-investment plans.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 14% in fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower performance fees from alternative investment products, lower distribution fees, and lower fund management and administration fees, reflecting a decrease in average assets under management. Fiscal 2008 also reflected lower shareholder servicing fees related to the modification of certain sub-transfer agent agreements, which resulted in an offsetting reduction to professional services expense.  

Other revenues increased 176% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to Asset Managements share ($74 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of OperationsMorgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion) and higher revenues associated with Lansdowne.  

Non-interest expenses decreased 40% in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 58% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs reflecting lower net revenues and losses associated with principal investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. The decrease in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by severance-related expenses. Non-compensation expenses decreased 5% in fiscal 2008. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 12%, primarily due to higher costs related to increased occupancy usage compared with fiscal 2007. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 5%, primarily due to lower commission expenses. Professional services expense decreased 24%, primarily due to lower sub-advisory fees and sub-transfer agent fees, partially offset by an increase in consulting and legal fees. Other expenses increased 25%, primarily due to an intangible assets impairment charge of $25 million.  

One Month Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with the One Month Ended December 31, 2007  

Asset Management recorded losses from continuing operations before income taxes of $114 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008 compared with losses before income taxes of $103 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007. Net revenues decreased 112% from the prior-period. The decrease in the one month ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflected lower asset management, distribution and administration fees of $111 million, partially offset by lower losses related to securities issued by SIVs of $84 million, compared with $119 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management of $290 billion were down $106 billion, or 27%, from $396 billion as of December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting decreases in equity and fixed income products resulting from market depreciation and net outflows. Non-interest expenses decreased $75 million to $105 million primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 53%, primarily reflecting lower revenues and reduced headcount.

Accounting Developments.  

Transfers of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities and Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. 

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance that changes the way entities account for securitizations and special-purpose entities (SPEs). The accounting guidance amends the accounting for transfers of financial assets and will require additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and where entities have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. It eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets.  

The accounting guidance also amends the accounting for consolidation and changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on, among other things, the other entitys purpose and design and the reporting entitys ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entitys economic performance. In February 2010, the FASB finalized a deferral of these accounting changes, effective January 1, 2010, for certain interests in investment companies or in entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies. For the entities included in the deferral, the Company will continue to analyze consolidation under other existing authoritative guidance; these entities are not included in the impact noted below.  

The adoption of this accounting guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition.  

Regulatory Outlook.  

It is likely that the year 2010 and subsequent years will see material changes in the way that major financial institutions are regulated both in the U.S. and worldwide. The reforms being discussed include several that contemplate comprehensive restructuring of the regulation of the financial services industry. Enactment of such measures likely would lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important firms in particular. Such measures could include taxation of financial transactions, liabilities and employee compensation as well as reforms of the OTC derivatives markets, such as mandated exchange trading and clearing, position limits, margin, capital and registration requirements. Other changes under discussion in the U.S. legislative arena include: breaking up firms that are considered too big to fail or mandating certain barriers between their activities in order to allow for an orderly resolution of failing financial institutions; curtailing the ability of firms that own FDIC-insured institutions to also engage in private equity, hedge fund and proprietary trading activities; requiring firms to maintain plans for their dissolution; requiring the financial industry to pay into a fund designed to help unwind failing firms; providing regulators with new means of limiting activities of financial firms; regulating compensation in the financial services industry; enhancing corporate governance, especially regarding risk management; and creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, to protect U.S. consumers who buy financial products.  

Reforms are being discussed concurrently in Washington, London, the European Union (EU) and other major market centers in which the Company operates, and attempts are being made to internationally coordinate the principles behind such changes through the G-20s expanded mandate for the Financial Stability Board and through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the International Association of Securities Commissioners and others. Among the internationally coordinated reforms are recent measures and proposals by the Basel Committee to raise the quality of capital, increase capital requirements for securitizations, trading book exposure and counterparty credit risk exposure, and globally introduce a leverage ratio, capital conservation measures and liquidity coverage requirements, among other measures. In both the EU and the U.S., moreover, changes to the institutional framework for financial regulation are being discussed or are underway.  

Many of the market reforms, if enacted, may materially affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period. In particular, if systemic regulation were  

64  

Table of Contents 

 enacted, the Company would likely be designated as a systemically important firm, and the consequences of systemic regulation, including a potential requirement for additional higher quality capital and liquidity and decreased leverage, could materially impact the Companys business.  

A substantial number of the financial reforms currently discussed in the U.S. and globally may become law, though it is difficult to predict which will become law, how such reforms will be implemented or the exact impact they will have on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period. As most changes, if adopted, will require regulatory implementation, the full impact of these changes will not be known until a later stage.

Other Matters.  

Settlement with DFS.  

On February 11, 2010, the Company and DFS entered into an agreement in which each party released the other party from claims related to the sharing of proceeds from the lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard. In addition, the Company and DFS entered into an agreement to provide that payments made by DFS to the Company in satisfaction of its obligations under the special dividend declared by DFS in June 2007, shall not exceed $775 million. Also on February 11, 2010, DFS paid the Company $775 million in complete satisfaction of its obligations to the Company under the special dividend. The payment will be included in discontinued operations in the Companys condensed consolidated statement of income for the first quarter of 2010.  

Sale of Bankruptcy Claims.  

During 2009, the Company entered into multiple participation agreements with certain investors whereby the Company sold undivided participating interests representing 81% (or $1,105 million) of its claims totaling $1,362 million, pursuant to International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements, against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection. The Company received cash proceeds of $429 million and recorded a gain on sale of $319 million in 2009. The gain is reflected in the consolidated statement of income in Principal transactionstrading revenues within the Institutional Securities business segment.  

As a result of the bankruptcy of the derivative counterparty, the Company, as contractually entitled, exercised remedies as the non-defaulting party and determined the value of the claims under the ISDA master agreements in a commercially reasonable manner. The Company filed its claims with the bankruptcy court. In connection with the sale of the undivided participating interests in a portion of the claims, the Company provided certain representations and warranties related to the allowance of the amount stated in the claims submitted to the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court will be evaluating all of the claims filed against the derivative counterparty. To the extent, in the future, any portion of the stated claims is disallowed or reduced by the bankruptcy court in excess of a certain amount, then the Company must refund a portion of the purchase price plus interest from the date of the participation agreements to the repayment date. The maximum amount that the Company could be required to refund is the total proceeds of $429 million plus interest. The Company recorded a liability for the fair value of this possible disallowance. The fair value was determined by assessing mid-market values of the underlying transactions, where possible, prevailing bid-offer spreads around the time of the bankruptcy filing, and applying valuation adjustments related to estimating unwind costs. The investors, however, bear full price risk associated with the allowed claims as it relates to the liquidation proceeds from the bankruptcy estate. The Company also agreed to service the claims and, as such, recorded a liability for the fair value of the servicing obligation. The Company will continue to measure these obligations at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. These obligations are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial condition as Financial instruments sold, not yet purchasedderivatives and other contracts.  

Real Estate.  

The Company acts as the general partner for various real estate funds and also invests in certain of these funds as a limited partner.  

      66    

Table of Contents 

The Companys real estate investments as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are shown below. Such amounts exclude investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Consolidated statement of financial condition amounts represent investment assets of consolidated subsidiaries, net of non-controlling interests. The decrease from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 was primarily due to the disposition of Crescent in the fourth quarter of 2009, whereby the Company transferred its ownership interest in Crescent to Crescents primary creditor in exchange for full release of liability on the related loans.  

 (2) In 2009, the Company consolidated certain real estate funds resulting in a transfer of investment assets of $0.2 billion, which is net of non-controlling interests of $0.6 billion, from real estate funds to consolidated interests. The results for 2009 for these newly consolidated subsidiaries, net of non-controlling interests, were not significant. The Company consolidated the funds during 2009 due to a reassessment of its primary beneficiary position with respect to the funds, reflecting the continued deterioration of equity in the funds combined with the Companys financial assistance provided to the funds. The limited partnership interests in the earnings of these funds are reported in Net income (loss) applicable to non-controlling interests on the consolidated statement of income.  

 (3) In 2009, losses on consolidated interests were $0.8 billion, of which $0.6 billion were included in discontinued operations related to Crescent. Losses on real estate funds and real estate bridge financing were $0.9 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, in 2009. In addition, the Company has contractual capital commitments, guarantees, lending facilities and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investments of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.  

Contributions. The Company made contributions of $321 million, $325 million, $130 million and $2 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations.  

The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions to its funded plans by considering several factors, including the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, the types of assets in which the plans are invested, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. The Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws (for example, in the U.S., the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA). As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the Companys U.S. pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The contributions made to the U.S. pension plan of $278 million and $276 million were funded based on the service cost earned by the eligible employees plus a portion of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation on a funding basis for 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Liabilities for benefits payable under certain postretirement and unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries.  

Expense. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of an employees pension benefits (including prior-service cost) over the employees estimated service period. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. For fiscal 2008, as required under the alternative transition method set forth in current accounting guidance, the Company changed the measurement date to coincide with the Companys fiscal year-end date. Net periodic pension expense was $175 million, $132 million, $143 million and $9 million, while net periodic postretirement expense was $26 million, $17 million, $14 million and $2 million for 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  

See Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including the adoption of accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

Critical Accounting Policies.  

The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  

Fair Value.  

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value. A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company makes estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include but are not limited to:  

       Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased;  

       Securities received as collateral and Obligation to return securities received as collateral;  

       Certain Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes;  

       Certain Deposits;  

       Other secured financings; and  

       Certain Long-term borrowings, primarily structured notes and certain junior subordinated debentures.  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  

In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 uses observable prices in active markets, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a continued downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, see Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

The Companys Level 3 assets before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $43.4 billion and $83.6 billion as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, and represented approximately 14% and 29% as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, of the assets measured at fair value (6% and 12% of total assets as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively). Level 3 liabilities before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $15.4 billion and $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, and represented approximately 9% and 17%, respectively, of the Companys liabilities measured at fair value.  

During 2009, the Company reclassified approximately $6.8 billion of certain Corporate and other debt from Level 3 to Level 2. The reclassifications were primarily related to certain corporate loans and bonds, state and municipal securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and other debt. For certain corporate loans, more liquidity re-entered the market, and external prices and/or spread inputs for these instruments became observable. For corporate bonds and CMBS, the reclassifications were primarily due to an increase in market price quotations for these or comparable instruments, or available broker quotes, such that observable inputs  

      68    

Table of Contents 

 were utilized for the fair value measurement of these instruments. For certain other debt, as the unobservable inputs became insignificant in the overall valuation, the fair value of these instruments became highly correlated with similar instruments in an observable market. For state and municipal securities, certain student loan auction rate securities (SLARS) were reclassified from Level 3 to Level 2 as there was increased activity in the SLARS market and restructuring activity of the underlying trusts.  

During 2009, the Company also reclassified approximately $3.3 billion of certain Corporate and other debt from Level 2 to Level 3. The reclassifications were primarily related to corporate loans and were generally due to a reduction in market price quotations for these or comparable instruments, or a lack of available broker quotes, such that unobservable inputs had to be utilized for the fair value measurement of these instruments. The key unobservable inputs are assumptions to establish comparability to other instruments with observable spread levels.  

During 2009, the Company reclassified approximately $10.2 billion of certain Derivatives and other contracts from Level 3 to Level 2, primarily related to single name subprime and CMBS credit default swaps as well as tranche-indexed corporate credit default swaps. Certain single name subprime and CMBS credit default swaps were reclassified primarily because the values associated with the unobservable inputs, such as correlation, were no longer deemed significant to the fair value measurement of these derivative contracts due to market deterioration. Increased availability of transaction data, broker quotes and/or consensus pricing resulted in the reclassifications of certain tranche-indexed corporate credit default swaps. The Company reclassified approximately $0.4 billion of certain Derivatives and other contracts from Level 2 to Level 3 as certain inputs became unobservable.  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis. Certain of the Companys assets were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company incurs impairment charges for any writedowns of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.  

For further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

Fair Value Control Processes. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial Control, Market Risk and Credit Risk Management Department (Credit Risk Management) participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model.  

Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or each party to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value  

    69      

Table of Contents 

 for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more information regarding the Companys risk management practices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk Management in Part II, Item 7A, herein.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.  

Goodwill. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally one level below its business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all of the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the value of the goodwill. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the book value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below book value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the Company believes market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair values are generally determined utilizing methodologies that incorporate price-to-book, price-to-earnings and assets under management multiples of certain comparable companies.  

The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of June 1, 2009 and 2008, which did not result in any goodwill impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment testing to July 1 as a result of the Companys change in its fiscal year-end from November 30 to December 31 of each year. The change to the annual goodwill impairment testing date was to move the impairment testing outside of the Companys normal second quarter-end reporting process to a date in the third quarter, consistent with the testing date prior to the change in the fiscal year-end. The Company believes that the resulting change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. Goodwill impairment tests performed as of July 1, 2009 concluded that no impairment charges were required as of that date. The Company determined that the change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date is preferable under the circumstances and did not result in adjustments to the Companys consolidated financial statements when applied retrospectively.  

Intangible Assets. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.  

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently when certain events or circumstances exist) for impairment. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.  

See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for intangible asset impairments recorded during 2009.  

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset.  

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and intangible assets. In addition, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the goodwill and intangible assets acquired on May 31, 2009 in connection with the consummation of the MSSB transaction and the goodwill and intangible assets acquired on July 31, 2009 in connection with the contribution of the managed futures business.

Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies.  

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.  

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  

Reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis and represent an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.  

The Company is subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate.  

The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with the requirements for accounting for contingencies. The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with accounting for income taxes. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded reserves, if any.  

See Notes 11 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings and tax examinations.  

Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities.  

The Companys involvement with SPEs consists primarily of the following:  

       Transferring financial assets into SPEs;  

       Acting as an underwriter of beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles;  

       Holding one or more classes of securities issued by, or making loans to or investments in, SPEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets;  

    71      

Table of Contents 

       Purchasing and selling (in both a market-making and a proprietary-trading capacity) securities issued by SPEs/variable interest entities (VIE), whether such vehicles are sponsored by the Company or not;  

       Entering into derivative transactions with SPEs (whether or not sponsored by the Company);  

       Providing warehouse financing to collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations;  

       Entering into derivative agreements with non-SPEs whose value is derived from securities issued by SPEs;  

       Servicing assets held by SPEs or holding servicing rights related to assets held by SPEs that are serviced by others under subservicing arrangements;  

       Serving as an asset manager to various investment funds that may invest in securities that are backed, in whole or in part, by SPEs; and  

       Structuring and/or investing in other structured transactions designed to provide enhanced, tax-efficient yields to the Company or its clients.  

The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial instruments. The Companys involvement with SPEs is discussed further in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.  

In most cases, these SPEs are deemed for accounting purposes to be VIEs. Unless a VIE was determined to be a QSPE (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) under the accounting guidance effective prior to January 1, 2010, the Company was required to perform an analysis of each VIE at the date upon which the Company became involved with it to determine whether the Company was the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case the Company had to consolidate the VIE. QSPEs were not consolidated under the accounting guidance effective prior to January 1, 2010. QSPEs are eliminated under the accounting guidance effective January 1, 2010.  

In addition, the Company serves as an investment advisor to unconsolidated money market and other funds.  

Under the accounting guidance effective prior to January 1, 2010, the Company was required to reassess whether it was the primary beneficiary of a VIE only upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. Under accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2010, the Company is required to reassess whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis and not only upon the occurrence of certain events.  

If the Companys initial assessment resulted in a determination that it was not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, then under the accounting guidance effective prior to January 1, 2010, the Company reassessed this determination upon the occurrence of:  

       Changes to the VIEs governing documents or contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocated the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the VIE between the primary beneficiary at that time and the other variable interest holders, including the Company.  

       Acquisition by the Company of additional variable interests in the VIE.  

If the Companys initial assessment resulted in a determination that it was the primary beneficiary, then under the accounting guidance effective prior to January 1, 2010, the Company reassessed this determination upon the occurrence of:  

       Changes to the VIEs governing documents or contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocated the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the VIE between the primary beneficiary at that time and the other variable interest holders.  

      72    

Table of Contents 

       A sale or disposition by the Company of all or part of its variable interests in the VIE to parties unrelated to the Company.  

       The issuance of new variable interests by the VIE to parties unrelated to the Company.  

The determination of whether an SPE met the accounting requirements of a QSPE required significant judgment, particularly in evaluating whether the permitted activities of the SPE were significantly limited and in determining whether derivatives held by the SPE were passive and nonexcessive. In addition, the analysis involved in determining whether an entity is a VIE, and in determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires significant judgment (see Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements).  

See Accounting DevelopmentsTransfers of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities and Consolidations of Variable Interest Entities herein for information on accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2010 for transfers of financial assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

The Companys senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. The Companys Treasury Department, Firm Risk Committee (FRC), Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and other control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated statements of financial condition, liquidity and capital structure.  

The Balance Sheet.  

The Company actively monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in managing the size of its balance sheet. The Companys total assets increased to $771,462 million at December 31, 2009 from $676,764 million at December 31, 2008.  

Cash used for operating activities primarily related to financial instruments ownedU.S. government and agency securities, securities borrowed, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Cash provided by operating activities primarily related to securities loaned, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and financial instruments ownedderivative and other contracts.  

Within the sales and trading related assets and liabilities are transactions attributable to securities financing activities. As of December 31, 2009, securities financing assets and liabilities were $376 billion and $316 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, securities financing assets and liabilities were $269 billion and $236 billion, respectively. Securities financing transactions include repurchase and resale agreements, securities borrowed and loaned transactions, securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received, customer receivables/payables and related segregated customer cash.  

Securities financing assets and liabilities also include matched book transactions with minimal market, credit and/or liquidity risk. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer owned securities, and customer cash, which is segregated according to regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer payables to the Companys prime brokerage clients. The Companys risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit the Companys credit exposure to customers. Included within securities financing assets was $14 billion and $5 billion as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, recorded in accordance with accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets that represented equal and offsetting assets and liabilities for fully collateralized non-cash loan transactions.  

The Company uses the Tier 1 leverage ratio, risk based capital ratios (see Regulatory Requirements herein), Tier 1 common ratio and the balance sheet leverage ratio as indicators of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of the Companys overall liquidity and capital policies.  

      74    

Table of Contents 

The following table sets forth the Companys total assets and leverage ratios as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 and average balances during 2009:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

N/AThe Company began calculating its risk weighted assets under Basel I as of March 31, 2009.  

 (1) The Company calculates its average balances based upon weekly amounts, except where weekly balances are unavailable, the month-end balances are used.  

 (2) Goodwill and net intangible assets exclude mortgage servicing rights of $123 million (net of disallowable mortgage servicing rights in 2009) and $184 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. In 2009, amounts included only the Companys share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets.  

 (3) Tangible common equity equals common equity less goodwill and net intangible assets as defined above. The Company views tangible common equity as a useful measure to investors because it is a commonly utilized metric and reflects the common equity deployed in the Companys businesses.  

 (4) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible Morgan Stanley shareholders equity.  

 (5) The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 common equity divided by RWAs. The Company defines Tier 1 common equity as Tier 1 capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying restricted core capital elements, adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing assets associated with MSSBs non-controlling interests (i.e., Citis share of MSSBs goodwill and intangibles). The Company views its definition of the Tier 1 common equity as a useful measure for investors as it reflects the actual ownership structure and economics of the joint venture. This definition of Tier 1 common equity differs from the Tier 1 common capital measure that was used by the federal bank regulatory agencies in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) conducted during the period February through April 2009. In SCAP, Tier 1 common capital was defined as Tier 1 capital less non-common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries, and qualifying trust preferred securities. Accordingly, the SCAP measure would not be adjusted for the $4.5 billion portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with MSSBs non-controlling interests as though the Company had already acquired the remaining 49% interest in MSSB owned by Citi. For a discussion of RWAs and Tier 1 capital, see Regulatory Requirements herein.  

Balance Sheet and Funding Activity in 2009.  

During 2009, the Company issued notes with a principal amount of approximately $44 billion, including non-U.S. dollar currency notes aggregating approximately $8 billion. In connection with the note issuances, the Company generally enters into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short-term London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) trading levels. The weighted average maturity of the Companys long-term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5.6 years as of December 31, 2009. Subsequent to December 31, 2009 and through January 31, 2010, the Companys long-term borrowings (net of repayments) decreased by approximately $0.6 billion.  

    75      

Table of Contents 

As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys senior indebtedness (as defined in the Companys senior debt indentures) was approximately $179 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries) compared with $172 billion as of December 31, 2008. The increase in the amount of senior indebtedness was primarily due to new issuances, partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.  

Equity Capital-Related Transactions.  

In June 2009, the Company repurchased the 10,000,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP at the liquidation preference amount plus accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate repurchase price of $10,086 million.  

In August 2009, under the terms of the CPP securities purchase agreement, the Company repurchased the Warrant from the U.S. Treasury for $950 million. The Warrant was previously issued to the U.S. Treasury for the purchase of 65,245,759 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $22.99 per share. The repayment of the Series D Preferred Stock in the amount of $10.0 billion, completed in June 2009, and the Warrant repurchase in the amount of $950 million reduced the Companys total equity by $10,950 million in 2009.  

During 2009, the Company issued common stock for approximately $6.9 billion in two registered public offerings in May and June 2009. MUFG elected to participate in both offerings, and in one of the offerings, MUFG received $0.7 billion of common stock in exchange for 640,909 shares of the Companys Series C Preferred Stock.  

See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions.  

Equity Capital Management Policies.  

The Companys senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. The Company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total equity, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Companys equity capital (which includes shareholders equity and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts) was $57,282 million, a decrease of $1,783 million from December 31, 2008, primarily due to the repayment of the Series D Preferred Stock and the Warrant repurchase, partially offset by the Companys common stock offerings.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $1.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program out of the $6 billion authorized by the Board in December 2006. The share repurchase program is for capital management purposes and considers, among other things, business segment capital needs as well as equity-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases by the Company are subject to regulatory approval. During 2009, the Company did not repurchase common stock as part of its capital management share repurchase program (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5).  

The Board determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In January 2010, the Company announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.05 (see Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company also announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend of $255.56 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.25556); a quarterly dividend of $25.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock and a quarterly dividend of $25.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock.

Economic Capital.  

The Companys economic capital framework estimates the amount of equity capital required to support the businesses over a wide range of market environments while simultaneously satisfying regulatory, rating agency and investor requirements. The framework continued to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques.  

Economic capital is assigned to each business segment and sub-allocated to product lines. Each business segment is capitalized as if it were an independent operating entity. This process is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis (such as return on equity and shareholder value added).  

Economic capital is based on regulatory capital plus additional capital for stress losses. The Company assesses stress loss capital across various dimensions of market, credit, business and operational risks. Economic capital requirements are met by regulatory Tier 1 capital. For a further discussion of the Companys Tier 1 capital, see Regulatory Requirements herein. The difference between the Companys Tier 1 capital and aggregate economic capital requirements denotes the Companys unallocated capital position.  

The Company uses economic capital to allocate Tier 1 capital and common equity to its business segments. The following table presents the Companys allocated average Tier 1 capital and average common equity for 2009 and fiscal 2008:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average Tier 1 capital and common equity allocated to the Institutional Securities business segment decreased compared with fiscal 2008 driven by reductions in market and operational risk exposures. In addition, common equity allocated to the Institutional Securities business segment further decreased due to tightening of the Companys own credit spreads. Average Tier 1 capital and common equity allocated to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment increased from fiscal 2008 driven by higher operational risk associated with the addition of Smith Barneys business activities in connection with the MSSB transaction. Average common equity increases were also driven by the MSSB-related goodwill and intangibles. Average Tier 1 capital and common equity allocated to Asset Management decreased from fiscal 2008, primarily due to sales of the segments investments.  

The Company generally uses available unallocated capital for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs while maintaining adequate capital ratios. For a discussion of risk-based capital ratios, see Regulatory Requirements herein.  

Liquidity and Funding Management Policies.  

The primary goal of the Companys liquidity management and funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market environments. Given the mix of the Companys business activities, funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of secured and unsecured financing.  

    77      

Table of Contents 

The Companys liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the Company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations without material franchise or business impact. The key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the Companys business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of stressed market conditions.  

Liquidity Management Policies.  

The principal elements of the Companys liquidity management framework are the Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) and liquidity reserves. Comprehensive financing guidelines (secured funding, long-term funding strategy, surplus capacity, diversification and staggered maturities) support the Companys target liquidity profile.  

Contingency Funding Plan. The CFP is the Companys primary liquidity risk management tool. The CFP models a potential, prolonged liquidity contraction over a one-year time period and sets forth a course of action to effectively manage a liquidity event. The CFP and liquidity risk exposures are evaluated on an ongoing basis and reported to the FRC, ALCO and other appropriate risk committees.  

The Companys CFP model incorporates scenarios with a wide range of potential cash outflows during a range of liquidity stress events, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance; (ii) maturity roll-off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral; (iii) return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities; (iv) additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a multi-notch long-term credit ratings downgrade; (v) higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding; (vi) client cash withdrawals; (vii) drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; and (viii) discretionary unsecured debt buybacks.  

The CFP is produced on a parent and major subsidiary level to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability at various legal entities. The CFP assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be held at certain subsidiaries due to regulatory, legal or tax constraints.  

Liquidity Reserves. The Company seeks to maintain target liquidity reserves that are sized to cover daily funding needs and meet strategic liquidity targets as outlined in the CFP. These liquidity reserves are held in the form of cash deposits and pools of central bank eligible unencumbered securities. The parent company liquidity reserve is managed globally and consists of overnight cash deposits and unencumbered U.S. and European government bonds, agencies and agency pass-throughs. The Company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserves (cash and securities) are maintained enhances its ability to quickly and efficiently source funding in a stressed environment. The Companys funding requirements and target liquidity reserves may vary based on changes to the level and composition of its balance sheet, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors.  

On December 31, 2009, the parent liquidity reserve was $64 billion, and the total Company liquidity reserve was $163 billion. The average parent liquidity reserve was $61 billion, and the average total Company liquidity reserve was $154 billion for 2009.  

Capital Covenants.  

In October 2006 and April 2007, the Company executed replacement capital covenants in connection with offerings by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII (the Capital Securities). Under the terms of the replacement capital covenants, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of certain specified holders of debt, to limitations on its ability to redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities for specified periods of time. For a complete description of the Capital Securities and the terms of the replacement capital covenants, see the Companys Current Reports on Form 8-K dated October 12, 2006 and April 26, 2007.

Funding Management Policies.  

The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period.  

The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include the Companys equity capital, long-term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, commercial paper, letters of credit and lines of credit. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the U.S., European and Asian markets, targeting global investors and currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen.  

Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with collateralized borrowings.  

The Companys goal is to achieve an optimal mix of secured and unsecured funding through appropriate use of collateralized borrowings. The Institutional Securities business segment emphasizes the use of collateralized short-term borrowings to limit the growth of short-term unsecured funding, which is generally more subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. As part of this effort, the Institutional Securities business segment continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity.  

In addition, the Company, through several of its subsidiaries, maintains committed credit facilities to support various businesses, including the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan, derivative contracts, warehouse lending, emerging market loan, structured product, corporate loan, investment banking and prime brokerage businesses.  

The Company also had the ability to access liquidity from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) against collateral through a number of lending facilities. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and the Primary Credit Facility were available to provide daily access to funding for primary dealers and depository institutions, respectively. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Term Auction Facility were available to primary dealers and depository institutions, respectively, and allowed for the borrowing of longer term funding on a regular basis that was available at auction on pre-announced dates. The PDCF and TSLF expired on February 1, 2010.  

Unsecured Financing. The Company views long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding for core inventories and illiquid assets. Securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate and deposits. The Company uses derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management and to hedge interest rate risk (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). In October 2008, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury invoked the systemic risk exception of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, and the FDIC announced the TLGP.  

Based on the Final Rule adopted on November 21, 2008, the TLGP provides a guarantee, through the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, of certain senior unsecured debt issued by participating Eligible Entities (including the Company) between October 14, 2008 and June 30, 2009. Effective March 23, 2009, the FDIC adopted an Interim Rule that extends the expiration of the FDIC guarantee on debt issued by certain issuers (including the Company) on or after April 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012. The maximum amount of FDIC-guaranteed debt a participating  

    79      

Table of Contents 

 Eligible Entity (including the Company) may have outstanding is 125% of the entitys senior unsecured debt that was outstanding as of September 30, 2008 that was scheduled to mature on or before June 30, 2009. The ability of certain Eligible Entities (including the Company) to issue guaranteed debt under this program, under the Interim Rule described above, expired on October 31, 2009.  

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $23.8 billion of senior unsecured debt outstanding under the TLGP. At December 31, 2008, the Company had commercial paper and long-term debt outstanding of $6.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively, under the TLGP. The weighted average rate at which the Company issued commercial paper and long-term debt, including TLGP fees, under the TLGP as of December 31, 2008 was 2.28% and 3.70%, respectively. The weighted average rate at which the Company issued long-term debt under TLGP in the first quarter of 2009, including TLGP fees was 2.80%. The Company did not issue any commercial paper under the program in the first quarter of 2009. The Company is unable to determine the benefit to operating results, if any, of issuing debt under the TLGP as there are no appropriate benchmarks due to the disruption in the debt capital markets at that time. There have been no issuances under the TLGP since March 31, 2009. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on commercial paper and long-term borrowings.  

Short-Term Borrowings. The Companys unsecured short-term borrowings may consist of commercial paper, bank loans, bank notes and structured notes with maturities of 12 months or less at issuance.  

The table below summarizes the Companys short-term unsecured borrowings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Commercial Paper Funding Facility. During 2009, the Company had the ability to access the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) which provided a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle that purchased three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers. The CPFF program expired on February 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding under the CPFF program. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $4.3 billion outstanding under the CPFF program.  

Deposits. The Companys bank subsidiaries funding sources include bank deposit sweeps, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, certificates of deposit, money market deposit accounts, commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  

Deposits were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Total deposits insured by the FDIC at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were $46 billion and $47 billion, respectively.  

 (2) Certain time deposit accounts are carried at fair value under the fair value option (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

On November 12, 2009, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a final rule amending the assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly regular risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 (the prepayment period) on December 30, 2009, at the same time that institutions pay their regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments for the third quarter of 2009. The prepaid assessment is recorded as a prepaid expense (asset) as of December 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, and each quarter thereafter, the Company will record an expense (charge to earnings) for its regular quarterly assessment for the quarter and an offsetting credit to the prepaid assessment until the asset is exhausted.  

On October 3, 2008, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the FDIC temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. This increased coverage lasts through December 31, 2013 and is in effect for the Companys two U.S. depository institutions.  

Additionally, under the Final Rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, the FDIC provides unlimited deposit insurance through June 30, 2010 for certain transaction accounts at FDIC-insured participating institutions. The Company has elected for its FDIC-insured subsidiaries to participate in the extension of the Transaction Account Guarantee Program.  

Long-Term Borrowings. The Company uses a variety of long-term debt funding sources to generate liquidity, taking into consideration the results of the CFP requirements. In addition, the issuance of long-term debt allows the Company to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short-term borrowings). Financing transactions are generally structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients. Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.  

During 2009, the Companys long-term financing strategy was driven, in part, by its continued focus on improving its balance sheet strength (evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions). As a result, for 2009, a principal amount of approximately $44 billion of unsecured debt was issued, including $30 billion of publicly issued senior unsecured notes not guaranteed by the FDIC.  

The Company may from time to time engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt repurchases) that it believes are in the best interests of the Company and its investors. Maturities and debt repurchases during 2009 were approximately $33 billion in aggregate.  

Long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2009 consisted of the following (dollars in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long-term borrowings.  

Credit Ratings.  

The Company relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are dependent on the Companys short-term and long-term credit ratings. In  

    81      

Table of Contents 

 addition, the Companys debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Factors that are important to the determination of the Companys credit ratings include the level and quality of earnings, capital adequacy, liquidity, risk appetite and management, asset quality, business mix and perceived levels of government support.  

In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, the Company may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade. As of December 31, 2009, the amount of additional collateral or termination payments that could be called by counterparties under the terms of such agreements in the event of a one-notch downgrade of the Companys long-term credit rating was approximately $1,405 million. A total of approximately $2,523 million in collateral or termination payments could be called in the event of a two-notch downgrade. A total of approximately $3,417 million in collateral or termination payments could be called in the event of a three-notch downgrade.  

As of January 31, 2010, the Companys and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.s senior unsecured ratings were as set forth below:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements with Unconsolidated Entities.  

The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities business segment.  

Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets were approximately $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, substantially all of which were related to U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage loan and residential mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.  

The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Guarantees. Accounting guidance for guarantees requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. The FASB defines guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in  

      82    

Table of Contents 

 an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. The FASB also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.  

The table below summarizes certain information regarding the Companys obligations under guarantee arrangements as of December 31, 2009:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Carrying amounts of derivative contracts are shown on a gross basis prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting. For further information on derivative contracts, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (2) Amounts include a guarantee to investors in undivided participating interests in claims the Company made against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection. To the extent, in the future, any portion of the claims is disallowed or reduced by the bankruptcy court in excess of a certain amount, then the Company must refund a portion of the purchase price plus interest. For further information, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (3) Approximately $2.0 billion of standby letters of credit are also reflected in the Commitments table in primary and secondary lending commitments. Standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value within Financial instruments owned or Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated statements of financial condition.  

 (4) Amounts include guarantees issued by consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company of approximately $2.0 billion. These guarantees relate to obligations of the funds investee entities, including guarantees related to capital expenditures and principal and interest debt payments. Accrued losses under these guarantees of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of the related fund investments, which are reflected in Financial instruments ownedinvestments on the consolidated statement of financial condition.

Commitments and Contractual Obligations.  

The Companys commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees obtained to satisfy collateral requirements, investment activities, corporate lending and financing arrangements, mortgage lending and margin lending as of December 31, 2009 are summarized below by period of expiration. Since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) These commitments are recorded at fair value within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated statements of financial condition (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 (2) This amount includes commitments to asset-backed commercial paper conduits of $276 million as of December 31, 2009, of which $268 million have maturities of less than one year and $8 million of which have maturities of one to three years.  

 (3) The Company enters into forward starting securities purchased under agreements to resell (agreements that have a trade date as of or prior to December 31, 2009 and settle subsequent to period-end). These agreements primarily settle within three business days and as of December 31, 2009, $26.6 billion of the $30.2 billion settled within three business days.  

 (4) Amount includes a $200 million lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company. 

For further description of these commitments, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk in Part II, Item 7A.  

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations include long-term borrowings, contractual interest payments, operating leases and purchase obligations. The Companys future cash payments associated with its obligations as of December 31, 2009 are summarized below:

 (2) Amounts represent estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings and secured long-term financings based on applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2009. Includes stated coupon rates, if any, on structured or index-linked notes.  

 (3) See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (4) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, advertising, sponsorship, computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements, and certain license agreements related to MSSB. Purchase obligations as of December 31, 2009 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition.  

 (5) See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (6) Amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable at this time (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information).  

Regulatory Requirements.  

In September 2008, the Company became a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act subject to the regulation and oversight of the Fed. The Fed establishes capital requirements for the Company, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the Companys compliance with such capital requirements (see Supervision and RegulationFinancial Holding Company in Part I, Item 1). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision establish similar capital requirements and standards for the Companys national banks and federal savings bank, respectively.  

The Company calculates its capital ratios and RWAs in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Fed. These standards are based upon a framework described in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I. In December 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published a final Basel II Accord that requires internationally active banking organizations, as well as certain of its U.S. bank subsidiaries, to implement Basel II standards over the next several years. The Company will be required to implement these Basel II standards as a result of becoming a financial holding company.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with Basel I capital requirements with ratios of Tier 1 capital to RWAs of 15.3% and total capital to RWAs of 16.4% (6% and 10% being well-capitalized for regulatory purposes, respectively). In addition, financial holding companies are also subject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the Fed. The Company calculated its Tier 1 leverage ratio as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets (which reflects adjustments for disallowed goodwill, certain intangible assets and deferred tax assets). The adjusted average total assets are derived using weekly balances for the calendar quarter. This ratio as of December 31, 2009 was 5.8%.  

      86    

Table of Contents 

The following table reconciles the Companys total shareholders equity to Tier 1 and Total Capital as defined by the regulations issued by the Fed and presents the Companys consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total allowable capital is composed of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists predominately of common shareholders equity as well as qualifying preferred stock, trust preferred securities mandatorily convertible to common equity and qualifying restricted core capital elements (including other junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and non-controlling interests) less goodwill, non-servicing intangible assets (excluding allowable mortgage servicing rights), net deferred tax assets (recoverable in excess of one year) and DVA. DVA represents the cumulative change in fair value of certain of the Companys borrowings (for which the fair value option was elected) that was attributable to changes in the Companys own instrument-specific credit spreads and is included in retained earnings. For a further discussion of fair value, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Tier 2 capital consists principally of qualifying subordinated debt.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Company calculated its RWAs in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements of the Fed, which is consistent with guidelines described under Basel I. RWAs reflect both on and off-balance sheet risk of the Company. The risk capital calculations will evolve over time as the Company enhances its risk management methodology and incorporates improvements in modeling techniques while maintaining compliance with the regulatory requirements and interpretations.  

Market RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and other factors. For a further discussion of the Companys market risks and Value-at-Risk (VaR) model, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. Market RWAs incorporate three components: systematic risk, specific risk, and incremental default risk  

    87      

Table of Contents 

 (IDR). Systematic and specific risk charges are computed using either a Standardized Approach (applying a fixed percentage to the fair value of the assets) or the Companys VaR model. Capital charges related to IDR are calculated using an IDR model that estimates the loss due to sudden default events affecting traded financial instruments at a 99.9% confidence level. The Company received permission from the Fed for the use of its market risk models through calendar year 2009 while undergoing the Feds review. Based on the final outcome of that review, the capital ratios may be lower or higher in 2010.  

Credit RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its financial obligations. For a further discussion of the Companys credit risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk in Part II, Item 7A, herein. Credit RWAs are determined using Basel I regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations issued by the Fed.  

Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.  

The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability.  

A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows.
