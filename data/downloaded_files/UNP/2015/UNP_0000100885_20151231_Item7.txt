Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this Item 7.   

 The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.   

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

 2015 Results  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Network Operations – Significant improvements were made in our operating and service metrics, as our average train speed, as reported to the AAR, increased 6% in 2015 compared to 2014, and our average terminal dwell time decreased 3%, both reflecting the impact of lower volumes and improved network fluidity. 

   ·    Fuel Prices – Our average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2015 decreased 38% from the average price in 2014, as both crude oil and the conversion spreads between crude oil and diesel declined in 2015. The lower price decreased operating expenses by $1.2 billion (excluding any impact from year-over-year volume declines). Gross-ton miles decreased 9%, which also decreased fuel expense. These declines were partially offset by a 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands.

 Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition   

 23  

to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

 2016 Outlook  

   ·    Safety – Operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents: our employees, customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement, and targeted capital investments. We will continue using and expanding the deployment of Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care throughout our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. We will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs and local community activities across our network.

 Continuing lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products that we transport. Alternatively, lower fuel prices will likely have a negative impact on other commodities such as coal, frac sand and crude oil shipments.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Operating Revenues  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and average revenue per car (ARC). Changes in price, traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive ARC. We provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations, which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments. We recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination. We allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them.  

 Other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage, accessorial revenues, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage, and miscellaneous contract revenue. We recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations.  

 Freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a 6% decline in carloadings and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by core pricing gains. Volume declines in coal, international intermodal, frac sand, metals, crude oil, and grain shipments more than offset volume growth in domestic intermodal, finished vehicles, automotive parts, industrial chemicals and plastics shipments.  

 Freight revenues from all six commodity groups increased during 2014 compared to 2013 driven by 7% volume growth and core pricing gains of 2.5%. Volume growth from grain, frac sand, rock, and intermodal (domestic and international) shipments offset declines in crude oil.  

 Our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $1.3 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.6 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2015 decreased $1.5 billion as a result of a 38% decrease in fuel price and a 6% reduction in carloadings. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2014 increased 6% based on our 7% carloadings increase.   

 In 2015, other revenue decreased from 2014 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries, primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services, partially offset by higher accessorial revenue driven by increased revenue for container usage and demurrage fees.   

 In 2014, other revenue increased from 2013 due to higher revenues at our subsidiaries, primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services, accessorial revenue driven by increased volume and per diem revenue for container usage (previously included in automotive freight revenue).   

 25  

The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and ARC by commodity type:

 drought also negatively impacted the first three quarters of 2013, which created favorable comparisons for the first three quarters of 2014. Lower export wheat shipments due to a larger world crop partially offset gains in grain.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 quarters of 2014 with improved sales and production, which offset declines in the first quarter due to winter weather. Shifts in business mix and a change in how we are compensated for container usage, which is now included as a per diem charge in other revenue, negatively impacted ARC compared to 2013.  

 Chemicals – Freight revenue from chemical shipments declined in 2015 versus 2014 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume declines, which more than offset core price improvements. Crude oil shipments declined as a result of the drop in crude oil prices and production declines from various shale formations, which impacted the regional pricing differences for crude oil. Lower fertilizer shipments also decreased freight revenue in 2015. Strength in export plastics markets and industrial chemical shipments helped offset the decline in crude oil and fertilizer shipments.  

 Core price improvements, higher volumes and     2015 Chemicals Carloads   

 ARC driven by positive business mix increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2014 compared to 2013. Shipments of industrial chemicals grew as a result of continued strong demand in the drilling market. Fertilizer shipments increased due to strong exports of potash. Reduced shipments of crude oil from the Bakken and Permian shale formations to the Gulf area partially offset these gains as market factors, primarily regional pricing differences for various types of crude oil, displaced some of the former Gulf Coast shipments to the East and West Coasts.  

 27  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 coal. This lower demand was a result of several utilities switching to other fuel sources due to lower natural gas prices. In addition, coal exports declined due to a soft global market.   

 Freight revenue from coal shipments increased in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by higher volumes. Shifts in business mix negatively impacted ARC compared to 2013. SPRB shipments increased 3% from 2013. Strong demand continued throughout the year due to inventory replenishment but network performance and contract losses limited year-over-year volume growth. Shipments from Colorado and Utah mines increased 6% compared to 2013, driven by higher natural gas prices for most of the year and strong exports through the West Coast. However, in the fourth quarter volumes from Colorado and Utah mines declined as exports to the Gulf Coast decreased.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Volume growth, core pricing gains and positive business mix in 2014 increased freight revenue for industrial products shipments versus 2013. Shipments of non-metallic minerals (primarily frac sand, up 31%) grew as a result of drilling activity for energy products, as well as evolving drilling practices, which can increase the amount of frac sand used at certain wells. Additionally, rock and lumber shipments increased from 2013, driven by new housing and commercial construction.   

 28  

 Intermodal – Lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume declines, partially offset by core pricing gains, resulted in a decline in freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2015 compared to 2014. International shipments declined 8% resulting from the supply chain disruptions stemming from the West Coast port work disruptions and historically high retail inventories. Domestic volume increased 3% driven by continued conversions from trucks and new premium services, more than offsetting the impact of high retail inventory levels and modest retail sales activity. 

 Freight revenue from intermodal shipments increased in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by     2015 Intermodal Carloads   

 volume growth, core pricing improvements and positive business mix. Domestic traffic increased 11% due to continued conversions from truck transportation to rail and new premium services. International traffic grew 5% versus 2013, driven primarily by new business and improving economic conditions. International gains in the last three quarters of the year offset the declines in the first quarter due to severe weather that negatively impacted consumer demand.   

 Mexico Business – Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Freight revenue from Mexico business decreased 4% to $2.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue. Volume levels were flat compared to 2014 as lower shipments of Intermodal, Agricultural, and Industrial Products were offset by growth in Automotive, Coal, and Chemical shipments.   

 Revenue from Mexico business increased 8% to $2.3 billion in 2014 versus 2013. Volume levels increased 8% from 2013, as increases in Agricultural Products, Chemicals, Intermodal, Automotive and Industrial Products offset lower export Coal shipments.  

 29  

 Operating Expenses  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 materials contributed to the higher costs. Lower fuel price partially offset these increases. In addition, there were approximately $35 million of weather-related costs in the first quarter of 2014.  

 Compensation and Benefits – Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, other postretirement benefits, and incentive costs. In 2015, lower volume-related costs and second half productivity gains were more than offset by general wage inflation and increased hiring and training expenses related to a larger workforce in the first half of the year.   

 Volume-related expenses, including training, and a slower network increased our train and engine work force, which, along with general wage and benefit inflation, resulted in increased wages in 2014 compared to 2013. Weather-related costs in the first quarter of 2014 also increased costs.   

 Purchased Services and Materials – Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials decreased $137 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower volume-related costs, including a decrease in external transportation expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries. Expenses also decreased due to lower locomotive and freight car repair costs.   

 Expenses for purchased services in 2014 increased 8% compared to 2013 primarily due to volume-related expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries for external transportation and increased crew transportation and lodging due to volumes and a slower network. In addition, higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses (including equipment maintenance) increased costs compared to 2013. Locomotive and freight car material expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to additional volumes, including the impact of activating stored equipment to address operational issues caused by demand and a slower network.  

 Fuel – Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.84 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2015, compared to $2.97 per gallon in 2014, decreased expenses $1.2 billion. In   

 30  

addition, fuel costs were lower as gross-ton miles decreased 9%. The fuel consumption rate (c-rate), computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands, increased 1% compared to 2014. Decreases in heavier, more fuel-efficient shipments, decreased gross-ton miles and increased the c-rate.   

 Volume growth of 7%, as measured by gross ton-miles, drove the increase in fuel expense in 2014 compared to 2013. This was essentially offset by lower locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.97 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2014, compared to $3.15 in 2013, along with a slight improvement in c-rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.   

 Depreciation – The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years, increased depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes.   

 Depreciation was up 7% in 2014 compared to 2013. A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting higher ongoing capital spending drove the increase.  

 Equipment and Other Rents – Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses. Equipment and other rents expense decreased $4 million compared to 2014 primarily from a decrease in manifest and intermodal shipments, partially offset by growth in finished vehicle shipments.  

 Higher intermodal volumes and longer cycle times increased short-term freight car rental expense in 2014 compared to 2013. Lower equipment leases essentially offset the higher freight car rental expense, as we exercised purchase options on some of our leased equipment.  

 Other – Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal injury, environmental, employee travel, telephone and cellular, computer software, bad debt, and other general expenses. Other expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as higher property taxes were offset by lower costs in other areas.  

 Higher property taxes, personal injury expense and utilities costs partially offset by lower environmental expense and costs associated with damaged freight resulted in an increase in other costs in 2014 compared to 2013.  

 Non-Operating Items  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Other Income – Other income increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $113 million gain from a real estate sale in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by a gain from the sale of a permanent easement in 2014.   

 Other income increased in 2014 versus 2013 due to higher gains from real estate sales and a sale of a permanent easement. These gains were partially offset by higher environmental costs on non-operating property in 2014 and lower lease income due to the $17 million settlement of a land lease contract in 2013.  

 Interest Expense – Interest expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increased weighted-average debt level of $13.0 billion in 2015 from $10.7 billion in 2014, partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 4.8% in 2015 compared to 5.3% in 2014.   

 Interest expense increased in 2014 versus 2013 due to an increased weighted-average debt level of $10.7 billion in 2014 from $9.6 billion in 2013, which more than offset the impact of the lower effective interest rate of 5.3% in 2014 versus 5.7% in 2013.  

 31  

Income Taxes – Lower pre-tax income decreased income taxes in 2015 compared to 2014. Our effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.7% compared to 37.9% in 2014.  

 Higher pre-tax income increased income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was 37.9% compared to 37.7% in 2013.  

 OTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS  

 We report a number of key performance measures weekly to the Association of American Railroads. We provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investor/aar-stb_reports/index.htm.  

 Operating/Performance Statistics  

 Railroad performance measures are included in the table below:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Average Train Speed – Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals. Average train speed, as reported to the Association of American Railroads, improved 6% in 2015 compared to 2014. Velocity gains resulted from lower volumes, improved network fluidity and a strong resource position. More favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 also contributed to the improvement in our average train speed.  

 Average train speed decreased 8% in 2014 versus 2013. The decline was as result of a 7% volume increase, a major infrastructure project in Fort Worth, Texas and inclement weather, including flooding in the Midwest in the second quarter and severe weather conditions in the first quarter that impacted all major U.S. and Canadian railroads.   

 Average Terminal Dwell Time – Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service. Average terminal dwell time improved 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations.  

 Average terminal dwell time increased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013, caused by higher volumes and inclement weather.  

 Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles – Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. Gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles decreased 9% and 12%, respectively in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting from a 6% decrease in carloads. Changes in commodity mix drove the variances in year-over-year declines between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloads.  

 Gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloadings all increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013.  

 Operating Ratio – Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue. Our operating ratio improved 0.4 points to a new record low of 63.1% in 2015 compared to 2014. Core pricing gains, the impact of lower fuel prices, resource realignments, network efficiencies and productivity gains more than offset the impact of lower volume and inflation.   

 Our operating ratio improved 2.6 points to 63.5% in 2014 versus 2013. Core pricing, business demand and productivity more than offset the incremental operating costs associated with volume, a slower network, weather and inflation.  

 32  

Employees – Employee levels increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by more employees in training and an increase in capital project work. More employees were in training as a result of the number of transportation employees hired during the last half of 2014 and early 2015 to handle expected volume increases, and who continued receiving training in 2015, most of which occurred in the first nine months of the year.  

 Employee levels increased 2% in 2014 versus 2013. A decrease in our capital workforce due to improved productivity and project mix partially offset the larger train and engine workforce required for higher volume levels and a slower network. We successfully managed the growth of our full-time equivalent train and engine force levels at a rate less than our volume growth in 2014.  

 Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Return on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *Adjusted for the retrospective adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2015-03 related to the presentation of deferred debt issuance costs.  

 ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC. Our 2015 ROIC decreased 1.9 points compared to 2014, primarily as a result of lower earnings and a higher invested capital base.  

 Debt to Capital

Adjusted Debt to Capital  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *Adjusted for the retrospective adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2015-03 related to the presentation of deferred debt issuance costs.  

 Adjusted debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure, including off-balance sheet lease obligations, which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities. Operating leases were discounted using 4.8% and 5.3% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The discount rate reflects our effective interest rate. We monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost-effective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital. Adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. The tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital. Our December 31, 2015 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a $2.8 billion increase in debt from December 31, 2014.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 As of December 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, our receivables securitization facility, and our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $1.7 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility, with no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015. We did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2015. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the $650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was $400 million as of December 31, 2015, and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt due after one year. Our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company’s $1.7 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.  

 34  

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a modest working capital surplus. This reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment. In addition, we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Activities  

 Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital, partially offset by the timing of tax payments.  

 Federal tax law provided for 100% bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. As a result, the Company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. Congress extended 50% bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in December, and the related benefit was realized in 2015, rather than 2014. Similarly, in December of 2015, Congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019, which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016. Bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50% for 2015, 2016 and 2017, 40% for 2018 and 30% for 2019.  

 Higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation.  

 Investing Activities  

 Higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars, including $327 million in early lease buyouts, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.  

 Higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013. Significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. Capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions.   

 35  

The following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   [a]    Other includes bridges and tunnels, signals, other road assets, and road work equipment. 

   [b]    Locomotives and freight cars include early lease buyouts of $327 million in 2015, $75 million in 2014, and $16 million in 2013. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Capital Plan – In 2016, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.75 billion, which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. While asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy, we expect to use 55% to 60% of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets. We will continue to invest in our network and terminals where appropriate, balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity. Significant investments in technology improvements are planned, including approximately $375 million for PTC. We will also continue commercial investments in rail facilities and equipment, including 230 locomotives and 450 freight cars.  

 We expect to fund our 2016 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following: cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, and cash on hand. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan. We expect our plan will enhance the long-term value of the Company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to (i) replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations, (ii) increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track, and (iii) make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth.  

 Financing Activities  

 Cash used in financing activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014. An increase of $712 million in dividends paid and $240 million for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program more than offset an increase of $740 million in debt issued and a decrease of $154 million in debt repaid. The higher dividend payments primarily were a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment within the same quarter. Aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payments in the first quarter of 2015: the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of $438 million, which was paid on January 2, 2015, as well as the first quarter 2015 dividend of $484 million, which was paid on March 30, 2015. The second quarter 2015 dividend of $479 million was paid on June 30, 2015, the third quarter 2015 dividend of $476 million was paid on September 30, 2015, and the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of $467 million was paid on December 31, 2015. Higher dividends per share also contributed to the increase in dividends paid.   

 36  

Cash used in financing activities remained flat in 2014 versus 2013. Increases for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2014 of $1.6 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2013 were offset by higher debt issuances in 2014.  

 Credit Facilities – At December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility (the facility), which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during 2015. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The facility matures in May 2019 under a five-year term and requires UPC to maintain a debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014 (and at all times during the periods presented), we were in compliance with this covenant.   

 The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain credit arrangements, capital leases, guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA. At December 31, 2015, the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to $41.4 billion of debt (as defined in the facility), and we had $14.3 billion of debt (as defined in the facility) outstanding at that date. Under our current capital plans, we expect to continue to satisfy the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio; however, many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The facility also includes a $125 million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.   

 During 2015, we did not issue or repay any commercial paper, and at December 31, 2015, and 2014, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility.   

 (See further discussion in this Item 7 under Receivables Securitization Facility for information regarding the Company’s receivables securitization facility.)  

 Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges  

 For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 11.6, 13.5, and 11.8, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. (See Exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.)  

 Common Shareholders’ Equity  

 Dividend Restrictions – Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the Credit Facilities section above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends was $13.6 billion and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program  

 Effective January 1, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by December 31, 2017, replacing our previous repurchase program. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased a total of $16.0 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007. The table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand. Repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.  

 From January 1, 2016, through February 4, 2016, we repurchased 3.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $268 million.  

 Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings – We filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC that became effective on February 9, 2015. The Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $4.0 billion of debt securities, replacing the $4.0 billion authorized under our shelf registration filed in February 2013, which was fully utilized after our January 2015 debt offering noted below. Under our current shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time.  

 During 2015, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our shelf registrations:  

    Date    Description of Securities   

    January 29, 2015    $250 million of 1.80% Notes due February 1, 2020   

        $450 million of 3.375% Notes due February 1, 2035   

        $450 million of 3.875% Notes due February 1, 2055   

    June 19, 2015    $400 million of 2.250% Notes due June 19, 2020   

        $300 million of 3.250% Notes due August 15, 2025   

    October 29, 2015    $200 million of reopened 3.250% Notes due August 15, 2025   

        $500 million of 4.050% Notes due November 15, 2045   

        $400 million of 4.375% Notes due November 15, 2065    

 We used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. At December 31, 2015, we had remaining authority to issue up to $2.2 billion of debt securities under our current shelf registration.  

 Equipment Trust – On May 12, 2015, UPRR consummated a pass-through (P/T) financing, whereby a P/T trust was created, which issued $399 million of P/T trust certificates with a stated interest rate of 2.695%. The P/T trust certificates will mature on May 12, 2027. The proceeds from the issuance of the P/T trust certificates were used to purchase equipment trust certificates to be issued by UPRR to finance the acquisition of 182 locomotives. The equipment trust certificates are secured by a lien on the   

 38  

locomotives. The $399 million is classified as debt due after one year in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  

 Debt Exchange – On August 21, 2013, we exchanged $1,170 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2016 and 2040 (the Existing Notes) for $439 million of 3.646% notes (the New 2024 Notes) due February 15, 2024 and $700 million of 4.821% notes (the New 2044 Notes) due February 1, 2044, plus cash consideration of approximately $280 million in addition to $8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments-Derecognition, this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange, as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt, and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the New 2024 Notes and the New 2044 Notes. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. Costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately $9 million and were included in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2013.  

 The following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Receivables Securitization Facility – The Railroad maintains a $650 million, 3-year receivables securitization facility maturing in July 2017 under which it sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a consolidated, wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.  

 The amount outstanding under the facility was $400 million at both December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. The facility was supported by $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  

 The outstanding amount the Railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility, with a maximum of $650 million, may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase one percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change.  

 The costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates, program fees paid to participating banks, commercial paper issuance costs, and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability. The costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were $5 million, $4 million, and $5 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  

 39  

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

 As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.  

 The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   [b]    Includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate.  

   [c]    Represents total obligations, including interest component of $319 million. 

   [d]    Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for fuel purchases, locomotives, ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services. For amounts where we cannot reasonably estimate the year of settlement, they are reflected in the Other column. 

   [e]    Includes estimated other post retirement, medical, and life insurance payments, payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.  

   [f]    Future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2015. For amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain, they are reflected in the Other column. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   [a]    None of the credit facility was used as of December 31, 2015. 

   [b]    $400 million of the receivables securitization facility was utilized as of December 31, 2015, which is accounted for as debt. The full program matures in July 2017. 

   [c]    Includes guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations. 

   [d]    None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2015. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Guarantees – At December 31, 2015, and 2014, we were contingently liable for $53 million and $82 million in guarantees. We have recorded liabilities of $0 and $0.3 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of   

 40  

default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  

 OTHER MATTERS  

 Labor Agreements – Approximately 85% of our 47,457 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. On January 1, 2015, current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions. Existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential Emergency Boards and Congressional intervention) are exhausted. Contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending.  

 Inflation – Long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.   

 Derivative Financial Instruments – We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception, as well as our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.  

 Market and Credit Risk – We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. We manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.  

 Determination of Fair Value – We determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows.  

 Sensitivity Analyses – The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.  

 At December 31, 2015, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 4.2% of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2016 than our December 31, 2015 variable rate, which was approximately 1.1%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $6 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2015.  

 Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2015, and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.6 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2015. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.  

 Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges – We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in   

 41  

managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.  

 Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short-cut method as allowed by the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 815; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding.  

 Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges – We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.  

 Accounting Pronouncements – In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  

 In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 (ASU 2015-03), Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of debt issuance costs will be reported as interest expense. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 on December 31, 2015. As a result, the Company reclassified debt issuance costs from other assets to a direct deduction from debt due after one year on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, and had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows. All prior period financial information presented herein has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this ASU.  

 In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 (ASU 2015-17), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Subtopic 740-10). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the requirement for companies to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and non-current on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, companies will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on December 31, 2015. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, and had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows. All prior period financial information presented herein has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this ASU.  

 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10). ASU 2016-01 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  

 Asserted and Unasserted Claims – Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. To the extent possible, we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.  

 42  

Indemnities – Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.  

 Climate Change – Although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report), we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact. However, we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, using training programs to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.  

 Personal Injury – The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.  

 Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 94% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6% is related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2015. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $318 million to $345 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.  

 Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 43  

Our personal injury claims activity was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2015, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2015, and 2014.  

 Asbestos – We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos. We assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims. This liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:  

   ·    The ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation. 

   ·    The number of claims filed against us will decline each year. 

   ·    The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages. 

   ·    The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages. 

 Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 22% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 78% related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2015. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $120 million to $129 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.  

 Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Our asbestos-related claims activity was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2015, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2015, and 2014. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws   

 44  

governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.  

 Environmental Costs – We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified 290 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 31 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 19 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.  

 When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.  

 Our environmental liability activity was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Our environmental site activity was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  

 Property and Depreciation – Our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers. Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria. Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track. We use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items. We currently have more than 60 depreciable   

 45  

asset classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.  

 We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies. We perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property. Our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:  

   ·    Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes; 

   ·    Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets; 

   ·    Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and 

   ·    Expected salvage to be received upon retirement. 

 For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track. It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail). The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve). Our depreciation studies for rail in high-density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives. For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile. Rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material. Based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2015, the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 19 years to approximately 39 years. For all other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies. Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.  

 Estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets. We are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets. Actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.  

 Changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $66 million. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $70 million. Our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes. These lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base, resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately 1% to 2% in 2016 versus 2015.  

 Under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. Because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. During the last three fiscal years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties. A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations.  

 Income Taxes – We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated. Future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For example, a 1% increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $390 million.  

 When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. In 2015 and 2014, there were no valuation allowances.  

 We recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits – We use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For OPEB, the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate.  

 We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:  

   ·    Discount rate is based on a Mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds (rated AA by a recognized rating agency) for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plans’ expected benefit payments. 

   ·    Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. 

   ·    Health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions. 

 The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) for 2015 and the estimated impact on 2015 net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) relative to a change in those assumptions:

 The following table presents the net periodic pension and OPEB cost for the years ended December 31:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2016, we will measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach. Our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease to approximately $42 million in 2016 from $120 million in 2015. Our net periodic OPEB expense is expected to decrease to approximately $13 million in 2016 from $19 million in 2015.
