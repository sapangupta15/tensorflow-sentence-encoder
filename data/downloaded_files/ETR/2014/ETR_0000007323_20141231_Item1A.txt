RISK FACTORS 

Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See “FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION.”

Utility Regulatory Risks

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results.

The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment.

In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies’ base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies’ operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of the proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 

The base rates of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. Entergy Arkansas recovers fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved tariffs. Entergy Mississippi infrequently has traditional base rate cases, although one was filed and settled in 2014. More commonly, it obtains base rate adjustments through its formula rate plan, which operates annually. In the event that this formula rate plan were terminated, Entergy Mississippi would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 

In January 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s then-existing formula rate plans expired, and each company filed full rate cases in February 2013. As part of the rate cases that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed, each company requested that the LPSC approve new formula rate plans. In December 2013 the LPSC voted to approve a settlement that provides for the continued use, through the test year 2016 filing, of formula rate plans by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan changes are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has no cap but is not permitted to increase rates prior to the test year 2015 filing. As part of the settlement, both companies established mechanisms to recover non-fuel MISO-related costs calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment 

274
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

clauses. The formula rate plans continue to retain exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including the Ninemile 6 generating facility. In the event that these formula rate plans were terminated, or expire without renewal or extension, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. Additionally, in September 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC a joint application seeking to combine the two companies. In connection with this request, the companies are also seeking to combine the formula rate plans approved for each company into a single formula rate plan with a single combined-company filing for 2014. Most of the provisions under the existing separate formula rate plans would be retained under the combined formula rate plan. Further, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans have filed with the Council of the City of New Orleans a joint application seeking authorization to transfer certain assets of Entergy Louisiana used to serve the Fifteenth Ward of New Orleans (commonly referred to as Algiers) to Entergy New Orleans. Entergy New Orleans has operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year and has not yet been extended. If no formula rate plan is approved going forward, Entergy New Orleans will continue operating in the more traditional rate case environment.

The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings.

The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies.

The Utility operating companies’ cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period’s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources has been changed by the FERC, a development which has had and could continue to require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process.

The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005 the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule.

In 2007 through 2012, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 FERC decision on the cost allocation methodology, and in 2013 and 2014, payments were made by Entergy Texas to Entergy New Orleans. There have been challenges to the level and timing of payments 

275
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

made by Entergy Arkansas under the FERC’s decision and the prudence of the Utility operating companies’ production costs. The ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, could be uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.

The withdrawal and notices of withdrawal of certain Utility operating companies from the System Agreement create uncertainty regarding the System Agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the Utility operating companies.

Entergy Arkansas’s participation in the System Agreement terminated in December 2013, and Entergy Mississippi’s participation in the System Agreement is scheduled to terminate in November 2015.

In October 2013, the Utility operating companies filed at the FERC seeking to shorten to 60 months the provision in the System Agreement that requires a Utility operating company seeking to withdraw from the System Agreement to provide 96 months advance notice of termination of participation. In October 2013, Entergy Texas provided its notice to the other Utility operating companies to terminate its participation in the System Agreement after expiration of the proposed 60-month notice period or such other period as approved by the FERC. Subsequently, Entergy Texas filed its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement at FERC in October 2013. In January 2014, the LPSC directed Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to provide no later than February 15, 2014 notice of their intention to terminate their participation in the System Agreement, and to use their reasonable best efforts to achieve a consensual resolution permitting early termination of the System Agreement. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana provided notice of their termination on February 14, 2014. Accordingly, there is uncertainty regarding the continuation of the System Agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the Utility operating companies. 

For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation - Federal Regulation - System Agreement” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 

The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO’s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the MISO RTO, see the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation - Federal Regulation - Entergy’s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies’ ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways, including the implementation of competition among transmission providers, that cause additional risk. 

276
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies’ transmission assets that are under MISO’s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

Entergy’s and its Utility operating companies’ results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.

277
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be “turned off.” Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy’s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2015. Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy’s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

Entergy’s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant’s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect 

278
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan resulted in the NRC issuing three orders effective on March 12, 2012 requiring U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants, some of which could be material.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy’s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy’s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy.

The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies’ nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs – Spent Fuel Disposal” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy.

279
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner’s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.318 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13.241 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy’s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $127.318 million per reactor per incident (Entergy’s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.4 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $18.963 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.318 million cap.

NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. As of April 1, 2014, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $105.7 million for the Utility plants and $126.4 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL’s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment.

As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding.

Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the 

280
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner may contract with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation.

In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy’s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements.

Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts.

NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies’, System Energy’s and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements.

New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy’s nuclear power plants.

New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy’s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

(Entergy Corporation)

A failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations.

The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 2 was September 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 3 is December 2015. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC’s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC and, with respect to issues resolved by the ASLB, before the NRC on appeal. 

In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. In addition, before the NRC may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). Most commonly, those requirements are met by the applicant's demonstration that the activity authorized by the federal permit being sought is consistent with the host state's federally-approved coastal management policies. Entergy has undertaken three independent initiatives to resolve CZMA issues: "grandfathering," "previous review," and a "consistency certification." In December 2014 the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, issued a unanimous ruling stating that Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 “are exempt from New York’s Coastal Management Program.” That decision could be appealed. For further information regarding these environmental regulations see the “Regulation of Entergy's Business - Environmental Regulation - Clean Water Act” section in Part I, Item 1.

If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, see the “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis.

The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding.

Under NRC regulations, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant’s decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of individual plants’ decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its 

282
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC’s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.

If any Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct decommissioning without the benefit of a safe storage period, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources.

Vermont Yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in January 2015 after final shutdown in December 2014. The Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report for Vermont Yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the NRC in December 2014. Vermont Yankee’s future certifications to satisfy the NRC’s financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the NRC minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. Entergy expects that amounts available in Vermont Yankee’s decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in January 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from DOE litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. Filings with the NRC for planned shutdown activities will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required and will specifically address funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation.

Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy’s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.

Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 86%, 74%, 39%, 17%, and 19% of its generation portfolio’s planned energy output for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. 

Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices.

283
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.

The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the “Results of Operations - Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. With operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expiring in 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates), and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration.

Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy’s control to a significant degree, are:

•prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;

•seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts;

•availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;

•changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products;

•liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy’s full hedging term;

•the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;

•electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies;

•the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;

•weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;

•the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation;

•regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;

•increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear markets;

•union and labor relations;

284
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

•changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI);

•changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and

•natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a “public utility” under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC’s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’ generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the “Regulation of Entergy’s Business” section in Part I, Item 1.

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other 

285
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.

The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as expected long-term declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit’s operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets.

As discussed in the “Entergy Wholesale Commodities - Property” section in Part I, Item 1, the original expiration dates of the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 are 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates),and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the state in which the plants operate. On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. This decision was approved by the Board in August 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries.

General Business

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.

Entergy’s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-

286
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy’s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets.

The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy’s control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation’s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

A downgrade in Entergy Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant’s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation’s, any of the Utility operating companies’, or System Energy’s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.

Most of Entergy Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2014, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $159 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $5 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2014, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $51 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of December 31, 2014, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $52 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 

287
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.

From time to time, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. In particular, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, two of Entergy’s subsidiaries, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, are undertaking a transaction that would result in the combination of those entities into a single public utility. In addition, as discussed in the “Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital - Union Power Station Purchase Agreement” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, certain of Entergy’s subsidiaries have entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, consisting of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating), from Union Power Partners, L.P. Each of these transactions is subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these transactions or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations and the market’s perception of Entergy’s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:

•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;

•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;

•Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;

•Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and

•Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.

The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected.

Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies’ service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the “Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries.

288
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters.

The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the “Regulation of Entergy’s Business – Environmental Regulation” section of Part I, Item 1.

The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.

Entergy’s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies’ transmission system and generation assets. The changes to the 

289
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

The effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies’ results of operations.

Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies’ generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies’ financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Entergy’s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including the state of the national and regional economies, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, and the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting impact on Entergy’s operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances and building codes, are having a more permanent impact of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. Newer technologies such as distributed generation have not yet had a substantive impact on Entergy’s electricity sales, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. Since the national economy emerged from the last recession in 2009, Entergy’s industrial sales in particular have benefited from steady economic growth and relatively low natural gas prices from an historical perspective. Any substantial negative change in any of these factors has the potential to result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

In an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court’s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other “greenhouse gases” under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. In 2012 and 2013, EPA proposed a CO2 emission standard for new sources; this standard is expected to be finalized in 2015. Additionally, EPA proposed a CO2 existing source performance standard regulation in 2014 for finalization in 2015. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) establishes a cap on CO2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California.

290
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy’s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy’s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of Entergy’s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits currently are pending or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, drought, average temperatures, and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.

These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System’s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy’s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’, System Energy’s, and the Utility operating companies’ financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies’, System Energy's, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ business operations. Entergy’s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Two of Entergy’s Utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy’s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues.

Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial position.

Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.

Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ liquidity and financial position.

The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy’s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.

The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk.

The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity 

292
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the Act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. Non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as Entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. Position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. Position limit rules promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were vacated by the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. If the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of Entergy’s swaps activities.

The Act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the Act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. Both the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy’s benefit plan liabilities. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy’s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy’s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the “Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements.

The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.

Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and 

293
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.

Domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ technology systems may adversely affect Entergy’s results of operations.

As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy’s generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. An actual act could affect Entergy’s ability to operate the necessary information technology systems and network infrastructure. The Utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards. Despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by Entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of Entergy’s electric system. If Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company’s well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. In addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in Entergy’s care.

If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines.

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’, and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’, and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy’s income taxes, refer to Note 3 to the financial statements.

(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans)

The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy New Orleans’s results of operations and liquidity.

Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide 

294
Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer’s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s or Entergy New Orleans’s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations.

(System Energy)

System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.

System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy filed in October 2011 an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf’s operating license to 2044. System Energy’s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf.

For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies’ support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the “Grand Gulf-Related Agreements” section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the “Sale and Leaseback Transactions” section of Note 10 to the financial statements, and the “Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements” section of Part I, Item 1.

(Entergy Corporation)

As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.

Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation’s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries’ ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation’s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see the “Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions” section of Note 7 to the financial statements.

ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income decreased by $40.6 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher net revenue.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income increased $9.6 million primarily due to higher net revenue, higher other income, lower nuclear refueling outage expenses, and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher interest expense, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Net Revenue

2014 Compared to 2013

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the APSC, effective July 2013 and July 2014, and the effect of the APSC’s order in the 2013 rate case, including an annual base rate increase effective January 2014, offset by a MISO rider to provide customers credits in rates for transmission revenue received through MISO. Energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case.

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to the absence of reserve equalization expenses as compared to 2013 resulting from Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the System Agreement.

296
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to changes as a result of participation in the MISO RTO in 2014.

The asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because Entergy Arkansas records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation related costs collected in revenue. The variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings.

The MISO deferral variance is due to the deferral in April 2013, as approved by the APSC, of costs incurred

from March 2010 through December 2012 related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume during the unbilled sales period, partially offset by an increase of 190 GWh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage primarily in the residential sector.

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower margins on co-owner contracts due to contract changes.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to:

•an increase in the capacity acquisition rider, as approved by the APSC, effective with the first billing cycle of December 2012, relating to the Hot Spring plant acquisition. The net income effect of the Hot Spring plant cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity on the net plant investment with the remainder offset by the Hot Spring plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes; and

•increases in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the APSC, effective July 2014 and July 2013. Energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income.

The MISO deferral variance is due to the deferral in April 2013, as approved by the APSC, of costs incurred

from March 2010 through December 2012 related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO.

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to higher margins on co-owner contracts.

297
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The volume/weather variance is due to lower weather-adjusted usage across all sectors, partially offset by the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. The decrease in the industry usage was primarily driven by the pulp and paper industry, the chemicals industry, and the food products industry.

The asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because Entergy Arkansas records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation related costs collected in revenue. The variance is primarily caused by a decrease in regulatory credits because of an increase in decommissioning trust earnings.

Other Income Statement Variances

2014 Compared to 2013

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•a net increase of $26.4 million in energy efficiency costs, including a $4.3 million true-up to the 2013 energy efficiency filing for fixed costs collected from customers. These costs are recovered through the energy efficiency rider and have a minimal effect on net income;

•an increase of $21.2 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher material costs, higher nuclear labor costs, including contract labor, and higher NRC fees;

•an increase of $13.9 million due to an increase in storm damage accruals effective January 2014, as approved by the APSC;

•an increase of $7.5 million in administration fees in 2014 related to participation in the MISO RTO;

•an increase of $7.2 million due to the amortization in 2014 of human capital management costs that were deferred in 2013, as approved by the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the deferral of these costs;

•an increase of $5.2 million due to the amortization in 2014 of costs deferred in 2013 related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO, as discussed above; and

•the effects of recording the final court decision in 2013 in the Entergy Arkansas lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy related to spent nuclear fuel disposal. The damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $3.2 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.

The increase was partially offset by:

•a decrease of $20.8 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in September 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; 

•a decrease of $9 million resulting from costs incurred in 2013 related to the generator stator incident at ANO, including an offset for insurance proceeds. See “ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews” below for further discussion of the incident; and

•a decrease of $8.6 million resulting from costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the Utility’s transmission business.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, higher depreciation rates in 2014, as approved by the APSC, and the effects of recording the final court decision in 2013 in the Entergy Arkansas lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy related to spent nuclear fuel disposal. The damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $3.6 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as depreciation expense.

298
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Other income decreased primarily due to lower earnings in 2014 on decommissioning trust fund investments. There is no effect on net income as the trust fund earnings are offset by a corresponding amount of regulatory charges.

2013 Compared to 2012

Nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with the most recent outage as compared to the previous outages.

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•an increase of $24.3 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative, partially offset by the deferral, as approved by the APSC, of $21.8 million of these costs. See “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion;

•an increase of $16.2 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to the addition of the Hot Spring plant in November 2012;

•an increase of $16.1 million in energy efficiency costs. These costs are recovered through the energy efficiency rider and have minimal effect on net income;

•an increase of $10.8 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs and a settlement charge, recognized in September 2013, related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; and

•an increase of $9 million resulting from costs related to the generator stator incident at ANO, including an offset for expected insurance proceeds. See “ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews” below for further discussion of the incident.

The increase was partially offset by:

•a decrease of $4.6 million due to costs incurred in 2012 related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO. In April 2013, Entergy Arkansas began deferring these costs as approved by the APSC; and

•the effects of recording the final court decision in 2013 in the Entergy Arkansas lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy related to spent nuclear fuel disposal. The damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $3.2 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense. 

Also, other operation and maintenance expenses include $8.6 million in 2013 and $13.3 million in 2012 of costs incurred related to the now terminated plan to spin off and merge the transmission business. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of the Hot Spring plant in November 2012, partially offset by the effects of recording the final court decision in 2013 in the Entergy Arkansas lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy related to spent nuclear fuel disposal. The damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $3.6 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as depreciation expense. 

Other income increased primarily due to higher realized gains in 2013 on the ANO 1 and ANO 2 decommissioning trust fund investments. There is no effect on net income as these investment gains are offset by a corresponding amount of regulatory charges.

299
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Interest expense increased primarily due to:

•the issuance of $200 million of 4.90% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2012;

•the issuance of $250 million of 3.05% Series first mortgage bonds bonds in May 2013; and

•the issuance of $125 million of 4.75% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2013.

This increase was offset by the retirement, at maturity, of $300 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 40.8%, 36.2% and 38.4%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews

On March 31, 2013, during a scheduled refueling outage at ANO 1, a contractor-owned and operated heavy-lifting apparatus collapsed while moving the generator stator out of the turbine building. The collapse resulted in the death of an ironworker and injuries to several other contract workers, caused ANO 2 to shut down, and damaged the ANO turbine building. The turbine building serves both ANO 1 and 2 and is a non-radiological area of the plant. ANO 2 reconnected to the grid on April 28, 2013 and ANO 1 reconnected to the grid on August 7, 2013. The total cost of assessment, restoration of off-site power, site restoration, debris removal, and replacement of damaged property and equipment was approximately $95 million. In addition, Entergy Arkansas incurred replacement power costs for ANO 2 power during its outage and incurred incremental replacement power costs for ANO 1 power because the outage extended beyond the originally-planned duration of the refueling outage. In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request to exclude from the calculation of its revised energy cost rate $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident. The APSC authorized Entergy Arkansas to retain the $65.9 million in its deferred fuel balance with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident is available. 

Entergy Arkansas is pursuing its options for recovering damages that resulted from the stator drop, including its insurance coverage and legal action. Entergy is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage to the members’ nuclear generating plants, including ANO. NEIL has notified Entergy that it believes that a $50 million course of construction sublimit applies to any loss associated with the lifting apparatus failure and stator drop at ANO. Entergy has responded that it disagrees with NEIL’s position and is evaluating its options for enforcing its rights under the policy. During 2014, Entergy Arkansas collected $50 million from NEIL and is pursuing additional recoveries due under the policy. On July 12, 2013, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the Circuit Court in Pope County, Arkansas against the owner of the heavy-lifting apparatus that collapsed, an engineering firm, a contractor, and certain individuals asserting claims of breach of contract, negligence, and gross negligence in connection with their responsibility for the stator drop. 

Shortly after the stator incident, the NRC deployed an augmented inspection team to review the plant’s response. In July 2013 a second team of NRC inspectors visited ANO to evaluate certain items that were identified as requiring follow-up inspection to determine whether performance deficiencies existed. In March 2014 the NRC issued an inspection report on the follow-up inspection that discussed two preliminary findings, one that was preliminarily determined to be “red with high safety significance” for Unit 1 and one that was preliminarily determined to be “yellow with substantial safety significance” for Unit 2, with the NRC indicating further that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight. This report also noted that one additional item related to flood barrier effectiveness was still under review.

300
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In May 2014 the NRC met with Entergy during a regulatory conference to discuss the preliminary red and yellow findings and Entergy’s response to the findings. During the regulatory conference, Entergy presented information on the facts and assumptions the NRC used to assess the potential findings. The NRC used the information provided by Entergy at the regulatory conference to finalize its decision regarding the inspection team’s findings. In a letter dated June 23, 2014, the NRC classified both findings as “yellow with substantial safety significance.” In an assessment follow-up letter for ANO dated July 29, 2014, the NRC stated that given the two yellow findings, it determined that the performance at ANO is in the “degraded cornerstone column,” or column 3, of the NRC’s reactor oversight process action matrix beginning the first quarter 2014. Corrective actions in response to the NRC’s findings have been taken and remain ongoing at ANO. The NRC plans to conduct supplemental inspection activity to review the actions taken to address the yellow findings. Entergy will continue to interact with the NRC to address the NRC’s findings. 

In September 2014 the NRC issued an inspection report on the flood barrier effectiveness issue that was still under review at the time of the March 2014 inspection report. While Entergy believes that the flood barrier issues that led to the finding have been addressed at ANO, NRC processes still required that the NRC assess the safety significance of the deficiencies. In its September 2014 inspection report, the NRC discussed a preliminary finding of “yellow with substantial safety significance” for the Unit 1 and Unit 2 auxiliary and emergency diesel fuel storage buildings. The NRC indicated that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight. Entergy requested a public regulatory conference regarding the inspection, and the conference was held on October 28, 2014. During the regulatory conference, Entergy presented information related to the facts and assumptions used by the NRC in arriving at its preliminary finding of “yellow with substantial safety significance.” In January 2015 the NRC issued its final risk significance determination for the flood barrier violation originally cited in the September 2014 report. The NRC’s final risk significance determination was classified as “yellow with substantial safety significance.” 

The NRC’s January 2015 letter did not advise ANO of the additional level of oversight that will result from the yellow finding related to the flood barrier issue, and it stated that the NRC would inform ANO of this decision by separate correspondence. The yellow finding may result in ANO being placed into the “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column” of the NRC’s reactor oversight process action matrix. Placement into this column would require significant additional NRC inspection activities at the ANO site, including a review of the site’s root cause evaluation associated with the flood barrier and stator issues, an assessment of the effectiveness of the site’s corrective action program, an additional design basis inspection, a safety culture assessment, and possibly other inspection activities consistent with the NRC’s Inspection Procedure. The additional NRC inspection activities at the site are expected to increase ANO’s operating costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $2.6 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•income tax refunds of $48.9 million in 2014 compared to income tax payments of $184.6 million in 2013. Entergy Arkansas received income tax refunds in 2014 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The income tax refunds in 2014 resulted primarily from the utilization of Entergy Arkansas’s net operating losses by the consolidated group whereas the income tax payments in 2013 resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas had previously claimed a tax deduction;

•approximately $25 million in spending in 2013 related to the generator stator incident at ANO, as discussed

above; and

•$13.4 million in insurance proceeds received in 2014 for property damages related to the generator stator

incident at ANO, as discussed above.

The increase was partially offset by:

•a decrease in the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs including a $68 million System Agreement bandwidth remedy payment made in May 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the FERC’s February 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period and a $33.7 million System Agreement bandwidth remedy payment made in September 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the FERC’s orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the comprehensive recalculation for 2007, 2008, and 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the System Agreement bandwidth remedy payments;

•an increase of $60.1 million in pension contributions in 2014. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding;

•proceeds of $38 million received in 2013 from the U.S. Department of Energy resulting from litigation regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel;

•the timing of payments to vendors; and

•an increase of $24.6 million in storm spending in 2014.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $107.9 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•income tax payments of $184.6 million in 2013 compared to income tax refunds of $20.5 million in 2012. Entergy Arkansas had income tax payments in 2013 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The income tax payments in 2013 resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas had previously claimed a tax deduction;

•approximately $25 million in spending related to the generator stator incident at ANO, as discussed above; 

•$22.6 million in storm restoration spending in 2013 resulting from the December 2012 winter storm which caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas’s distribution lines, equipment, poles and other facilities; and

•a decrease in the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•proceeds of $38 million associated with the payments received in 2013 from the U.S. Department of Energy resulting from litigation regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel; and

•the $30.6 million June 2012 refund to AmerenUE, including interest, in rough production cost equalization payments previously collected from Ameren UE .

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased $76.2 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•an increase of $101.4 million storm spending in 2014; 

•fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and

•proceeds of $10.3 million received in 2013 from the U.S. Department of Energy resulting from litigation regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•approximately $69 million in spending in 2013 related to the generator stator incident at ANO, as discussed above;

•$36.6 million in insurance proceeds received in 2014 for property damages related to the generator stator incident at ANO, as discussed above; and

•money pool activity.

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $15.3 million in 2014 as compared to increasing by $9.5 million in 2013. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $198.8 million in 2013 primarily due to the purchase of the Hot Spring Energy Facility for approximately $253 million in November 2012 and fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle. See Note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of the purchase of the Hot Spring Energy Facility.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•approximately $69 million in spending related to the generator stator incident at ANO, as discussed above;

•$39.6 million in storm restoration spending in 2013 resulting from the December 2012 winter storm; 

•$7.6 million in storm restoration spending in 2013 resulting from the December 2013 winter storm; and

•money pool activity. 

Increases in Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool increased by $9.5 million in 2013 as compared to decreasing by $9.3 million in 2012. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities increased $72.6 million in 2014 primarily due to: 

•the issuance of $375 million of 3.70% Series first mortgage bonds in March 2014;

•the retirement, at maturity, of $300 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013;

•the issuance of $90 million of 9% Series L notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in July 2014;

•the issuance of $250 million of 4.95% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2014;

•net borrowings of $48 million on the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility in 2014 compared to net repayments of $36.7 million in 2013;

•the retirement, at maturity, of $30 million of 9% Series H notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in June 2013; and

•a decrease of $5 million in common stock dividends paid in 2014.

The increase was partially offset by:

•borrowings on a $250 million term loan credit facility entered into in July 2013 and its repayment, prior to maturity, in March 2014;

•the issuance of $250 million of 3.05% Series first mortgage bonds in May 2013;

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Capital Structure

Entergy Arkansas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The

increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Arkansas is primarily due to an increase in long-term debt as a result of the issuance of $375 million of 3.70% Series first mortgage bonds in March 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the debt to capital ratios

excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy Arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Arkansas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for:

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•dividend and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s planned construction and other capital investments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $92.5 million to its pension plans and approximately $16.9 million to other postretirement plans in 2015, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. See “Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $1.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas includes specific investments, such as the Union Power Station acquisition discussed below; NRC post-Fukushima requirements; environmental compliance spending, including potential scrubbers at White Bluff to meet pending Arkansas state requirements under the Clean Air Visibility Rule; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; resource planning; generation projects; system improvements; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, requirements, and oversight, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Arkansas’s long-term debt indenture restricts the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Arkansas had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $394.9 million.

Union Power Station Purchase Agreement

In December 2014, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Texas entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, a 1,980 MW (summer rating) power generation facility located near El Dorado, Arkansas, from Union Power Partners, L.P. The Union Power Station consists of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating). Pursuant to the agreement, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will acquire two of the power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility, and Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas will each acquire one power block and a 25% undivided ownership interest in such related assets. (If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Texas do not obtain approval for the purchase of their power blocks, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will seek to purchase the power blocks not approved.) The base purchase price is expected to be approximately $948 million (approximately $237 million for each power block) subject to adjustments. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates selling 20% of the capacity and energy associated with its two power blocks to Entergy New Orleans through a cost-based, life-of-unit power purchase agreement. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC, LPSC, PUCT, and FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In December 2014, Entergy Texas filed its application with the PUCT for approval of the acquisition. The PUCT has indicated that it will convene the hearing on the merits of this case in June 2015. Entergy Texas intends to file a rate application to seek cost recovery later in 2015. In January 2015, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed its application with the LPSC and Entergy Arkansas filed its application with the APSC, each for approval of the acquisition and cost recovery. Closing is targeted to occur in late-2015.

Sources of Capital

Entergy Arkansas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt or preferred stock issuances; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

306
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Arkansas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas’s corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Arkansas’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Arkansas has credit facilities in the amount of $20 million and $150 million scheduled to expire in April 2015 and March 2019, respectively. The $150 million credit facility allows Entergy Arkansas to issue letters of credit against 50% of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2014, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facilities. In addition, Entergy Arkansas entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility in 2014 as a means to post collateral to support its obligations under MISO. As of December 31, 2014, a $2 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Arkansas’s letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

The Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $85 million scheduled to expire in June 2016. As of December 31, 2014, $48 million was outstanding on the credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility.

Entergy Arkansas obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2015 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $250 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy Arkansas are limited to amounts authorized by the APSC and the Tennessee Regulatory Authority; the current authorizations extend through December 2015.

In March 2014, Entergy Arkansas issued $375 million of 3.70% Series first mortgage bonds due June 2024. Entergy Arkansas used the proceeds to pay, prior to maturity, its $250 million term loan, to pay, prior to maturity, its $115 million of 5.0% Series first mortgage bonds due July 2018, and for general corporate purposes.

In July 2014 the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel trust variable interest entity issued $90 million of 3.65% Series L notes due July 2021. The Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel trust variable interest entity used the proceeds to pay, at maturity, its $70 million of 5.69% Series I notes due July 2014 and to purchase additional nuclear fuel. 

In December 2014, Entergy Arkansas issued $250 million of 4.95% Series first mortgage bonds due December 2044. Entergy Arkansas used the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

Retail Rates

2013 Base Rate Filing

In March 2013, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. The filing assumed Entergy Arkansas’s transition to MISO in December 2013, and requested a rate increase of $174 million, including $49 million of revenue being transferred from collection in riders to base rates. The filing also proposed a new transmission rider and a capacity cost recovery rider. The filing requested a 10.4% return on common equity. In September 2013, Entergy Arkansas filed testimony reflecting an updated rate increase request of $145 million, with no change to its requested return on common equity of 10.4%. Hearings in the proceeding began in October 2013, and in December 2013 the APSC issued an order. The order authorized a base rate increase of $81 million and included an authorized return on common equity of 9.3%. The order allows Entergy Arkansas to amortize its human capital management costs over a three-and-a-half year period, but also orders Entergy Arkansas to file a detailed report of the Arkansas-specific costs, savings and final payroll changes upon conclusion of the human capital management strategic imperative. The detailed report was subsequently filed in February 2015. The substance of the report will be addressed in Entergy Arkansas’s next base rate filing. New rates were implemented in the first billing cycle of March 2014, effective as of January 2014. Additionally, in January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition for rehearing or clarification of several aspects of the APSC’s order, including the 9.3% authorized return on common equity. In February 2014 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s petition for the purpose of considering the additional evidence identified by Entergy Arkansas. In August 2014 the APSC issued an order amending certain aspects of the original order, including providing for a 9.5% authorized return on common equity. Pursuant to the August 2014 order, revised rates are effective for all bills rendered after December 31, 2013 and were implemented in the first billing cycle of October 2014.

On January 30, 2015, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a notice of intent to file a rate case within 60 to 90 days.

Production Cost Allocation Rider

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings. These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas’s deferred fuel cost balance because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. See Note 2 to the financial statements and Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - System Agreement” for discussions of the System Agreement proceedings.

In May 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider to recover the $3 million unrecovered retail balance as of December 31, 2013 and the $67.8 million System Agreement bandwidth remedy payment made in May 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the FERC’s February 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period. In June 2014 the APSC suspended the annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider and scheduled a hearing in September 2014. Upon a joint motion of the parties, the APSC canceled the September 2014 hearing and in January 2015 the APSC issued an order approving Entergy Arkansas’s request for recovery of the $3 million under-recovered amount based on the true-up of the production cost allocation rider and the $67.8 million May 2014 System Agreement bandwidth remedy payment subject to refund with interest, with recovery of these payments concluding with the last billing cycle in December 2015. The APSC also found that Entergy Arkansas is entitled to carrying charges pursuant to the current terms of the production cost allocation rider. Entergy Arkansas made its compliance filing pursuant to the order in January 2015 and the APSC issued its approval order, also in January 2015. The redetermined rate went into effect the first billing cycle of February 2015.

308
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Energy Cost Recovery Rider

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. The rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. 

In October 2005 the APSC initiated an investigation into Entergy Arkansas’s interim energy cost recovery rate. The investigation focused on Entergy Arkansas’s 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. In March 2006 the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in Entergy Arkansas’s March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the APSC investigation in October 2006.

In January 2007 the APSC issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. The APSC found that Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs that resulted from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. The coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and Entergy Arkansas has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. The APSC staff was directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas’s assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within sixty days of the order. After a final determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas will be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the order. 

In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for rehearing, and held a hearing in September 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy Arkansas. A decision is pending. Entergy Arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

The APSC also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through September 2010. The testimony has been filed, and the APSC will decide the case based on the record in the proceeding.

In January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its redetermination of its energy cost rate to be filed in March 2014. In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to exclude $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate. The $65.9 million is an estimate of the incremental fuel and replacement energy costs that Entergy Arkansas incurred as a result of the ANO stator incident. Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information is available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident. The APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request in February 2014. See the “ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews” section above for further discussion of the ANO stator incident.

Storm Cost Recovery

Entergy Arkansas December 2012 Winter Storm

In December 2012 a severe winter storm consisting of ice, snow, and high winds caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas’s distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Arkansas’s electrical facilities in areas damaged from the winter storm were $63 million, 

309
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

including costs recorded as regulatory assets of approximately $22 million. In the Entergy Arkansas 2013 rate case, the APSC approved inclusion of the construction spending in rate base and approved an increase in the normal storm cost accrual, which will effectively amortize the regulatory asset over a five-year period.

Opportunity Sales Proceeding

In June 2009, the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocate the energy generated by Entergy System resources, (b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity, and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement that prohibits sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies. The LPSC’s complaint challenges sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds. In July 2009, the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting that the FERC dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the LPSC has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the System Agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the Entergy System. In their response, the Utility operating companies explained that the System Agreement clearly contemplates that the Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company. The response further explained that the FERC already had determined that Entergy Arkansas’s short-term wholesale sales did not trigger the “right-of-first-refusal” provision of the System Agreement. While the D.C. Circuit recently determined that the “right-of-first-refusal” issue was not properly before the FERC at the time of its earlier decision on the issue, the LPSC raised no additional claims or facts that would warrant the FERC reaching a different conclusion.

The LPSC filed direct testimony in the proceeding alleging, among other things, (1) that Entergy violated the System Agreement by permitting Entergy Arkansas to make non-requirements sales to non-affiliated third parties rather than making such energy available to the other Utility operating companies’ customers; and (2) that over the period 2000 - 2009, these non-requirements sales caused harm to the Utility operating companies’ customers and these customers should be compensated for this harm by Entergy. In subsequent testimony, the LPSC modified its original damages claim in favor of quantifying damages by re-running intra-system bills. The Utility operating companies believe the LPSC’s allegations are without merit. A hearing in the matter was held in August 2010.

In December 2010, the ALJ issued an initial decision. The ALJ found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. The ALJ concluded that “shareholders” should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along with interest. Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision.

The FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. The FERC found, however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load, but provides a different allocation authority. The FERC further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the System Agreement. Quantifying the effect of the FERC’s decision will require re-running intra-system bills for a ten-year period, and the FERC in its decision established further hearing procedures to determine the calculation of the effects. In July 2012, Entergy and the LPSC filed requests for rehearing of the FERC’s June 2012 decision, which are pending with the FERC.

As required by the procedural schedule established in the calculation proceeding, Entergy filed its direct testimony that included a proposed illustrative re-run, consistent with the directives in FERC’s order, of intra-system bills for 2003, 2004, and 2006, the three years with the highest volume of opportunity sales. Entergy’s proposed illustrative re-run of intra-system bills shows that the potential cost for Entergy Arkansas would be up to $12 million

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, excluding interest, and the potential benefit would be significantly less than that for each of the other Utility operating companies. Entergy’s proposed illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills also shows an offsetting potential benefit to Entergy Arkansas for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006 resulting from the effects of the FERC’s order on System Agreement Service Schedules MSS-1, MSS-2, and MSS-3, and the potential offsetting cost would be significantly less than that for each of the other Utility operating companies. Entergy provided to the LPSC an illustrative intra-system bill recalculation as specified by the LPSC for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, and the LPSC then filed answering testimony in December 2012. In its testimony the LPSC claims that the damages, excluding interest, that should be paid by Entergy Arkansas to the other Utility operating company’s customers for 2003, 2004, and 2006 are $42 million to Entergy Gulf States, Inc., $7 million to Entergy Louisiana, $23 million to Entergy Mississippi, and $4 million to Entergy New Orleans. The FERC staff and certain intervenors filed direct and answering testimony in February 2013. In April 2013, Entergy filed its rebuttal testimony in that proceeding, including a revised illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006. The revised calculation determines the re-pricing of the opportunity sales based on consideration of moveable resources only and the removal of exchange energy received by Entergy Arkansas, which increases the potential cost for Entergy Arkansas over the three years 2003, 2004, and 2006 by $2.3 million from the potential costs identified in the Utility operating companies’ prior filings in September and October 2012. A hearing was held in May 2013 to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the FERC’s decision. 

In August 2013 the presiding judge issued an initial decision in the calculation proceeding. The initial decision concludes that the methodology proposed by the LPSC, rather than the methodologies proposed by Entergy or the FERC Staff, should be used to calculate the payments that Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility operating companies. The initial decision also concludes that the other System Agreement service schedules should not be adjusted and that payments by Entergy Arkansas should not be reflected in the rough production cost equalization bandwidth calculations for the applicable years. The initial decision does recognize that the LPSC’s methodology would result in an inequitable windfall to the other Utility operating companies and, therefore, concludes that any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by 20%. The Utility operating companies are currently analyzing the effects of the initial decision. The LPSC, APSC, City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. Entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff. The FERC’s review of the initial decision is pending. No payments will be made or received by the Utility operating companies until the FERC issues an order reviewing the initial decision and Entergy submits a subsequent filing to comply with that order.

Federal Regulation

See “Entergy’s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization,” “System Agreement,” and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics.

Nuclear Matters

Entergy Arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

311
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to ANO and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in July 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. The task force then issued a second report in September 2011. Based upon the task force’s recommendations, the NRC issued three orders effective on March 12, 2012. The three orders require U.S. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. The NRC, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. Entergy Arkansas’s estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the NRC orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uses of Capital” above.

Environmental Risks

Entergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

In 2014, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and ANO 2 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimates resulted in a $47.6 million increase in the decommissioning cost liabilities, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.

Unbilled Revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the 

312
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Arkansas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2014 was $42.4 million. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $62.7 million. Entergy Arkansas contributed $95.5 million to its pension plan in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $92.5 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Arkansas in 2014 was $2.1 million. Entergy Arkansas expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs of approximately 

313
Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

$3.2 million. Entergy Arkansas contributed $15.3 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute approximately $16.9 million in 2015.

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $106.9 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $16 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $15.4 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.2 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

ENTERGY GULF STATES LOUISIANA, L.L.C.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination

In June 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a business combination study report with the LPSC. The report contained a preliminary analysis of the potential combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana into a single public utility, including an overview of the combination that identified its potential customer benefits. Although not part of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana provided notice to the City Council in June 2014 that it would seek authorization to transfer to Entergy New Orleans the assets that currently support the provision of service to Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers. Entergy Louisiana subsequently filed the referenced application with the City Council in October 2014. In the summer of 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana held technical conferences and face-to-face meetings with LPSC staff and other stakeholders to discuss potential effects of the combination, solicit suggestions and concerns, and identify areas in which additional information might be needed. 

On September 30, 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking authorization to undertake the transactions that would result in the combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana into a single public utility. 

The combination is subject to regulatory review and approval of the LPSC, the FERC, and the NRC. In June 2014, Entergy submitted an application to the NRC for approval of River Bend and Waterford 3 license transfers as part of the steps to complete the business combination. The combination also could be subject to regulatory review of the City Council if Entergy Louisiana continues to own the assets that currently support Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers at the time the combination is effectuated. In November 2014, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake the combination. The application provides that if the City Council approves the Algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the City Council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the combination. In December 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed applications with the FERC requesting authorization for the business combination and the Algiers asset transfer. In January 2015, Entergy Services filed an application with the FERC for financing authority for the combined company. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC, the FERC, the NRC, and, if required, the City Council, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expect the combination will be effected in the second half of 2015.

The procedural schedule in the LPSC business combination proceeding calls for LPSC Staff and intervenor testimony to be filed in March 2015, with a hearing scheduled for June 2015. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana have requested that the LPSC issue its decision regarding the business combination in August 2015. In the City Council business combination proceeding, the City Council announced through a resolution that it would not initiate an active review of the business combination filing, but instead would establish a business combination docket for the limited purpose of receiving information filings relative to the business combination proceedings at the LPSC.

It is currently contemplated that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will undertake multiple steps to effectuate the combination, which steps would include the following:

•Each of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will redeem or repurchase all of their respective outstanding preferred membership interests (which interests have a $100 million liquidation value in the case of Entergy Louisiana and $10 million liquidation value in the case of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana).

•Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will convert from a Louisiana limited liability company to a Texas limited liability company.

322
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Louisiana will allocate substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Louisiana) and New Entergy Louisiana will assume all of the liabilities of Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Louisiana will remain in existence and hold the membership interests in New Entergy Louisiana.

•Under the TXBOC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will allocate substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will assume all of the liabilities of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will remain in existence and hold the membership interests in New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

•Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will contribute the membership interests in New Entergy Louisiana and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to an affiliate the common membership interests of which will be owned by Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Corporation.

•New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will merge into New Entergy Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger.

Upon the completion of the steps, New Entergy Louisiana will hold substantially all of the assets, and will have assumed all of the liabilities, of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may modify or supplement the steps to be taken to effect the combination.

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income increased slightly, by $0.8 million, primarily due to higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, substantially offset by a higher effective income tax rate, lower other income, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher interest expense, and higher taxes other than income taxes. 

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income increased $2.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, substantially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, and a higher effective income tax rate partially due to the settlement of the tax treatment related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita Louisiana Act 55 financing in June 2012. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.

323
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net Revenue

2014 Compared to 2013

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,160 GWh, or 6%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales and higher industrial usage primarily in the chemicals industry.

The asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because Entergy Gulf States Louisiana records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. The variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings and an increase in regulatory credits to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.

The MISO deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of the non-fuel MISO-related charges, as approved by the LPSC. The deferral of non-fuel MISO-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the recovery of non-fuel MISO-related charges.

The transmission equalization variance is primarily due to changes in transmission investment equalization billings under the Entergy System Agreement compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the System Agreement in December 2013.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in purchased power capacity costs that are recovered through base rates set in the annual formula rate plan mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Louisiana Act 55 financing savings obligation variance results from a regulatory charge recorded in the second quarter 2012 because Entergy Gulf States Louisiana was required to share with customers the savings from the tax treatment related to the Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita Louisiana Act 55 financing. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to higher prices. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 82 GWh, or 0.4%, in billed electricity usage as a result of the effect of more favorable weather, as compared to the prior period, primarily on residential sales. The increase was also driven by higher industrial usage primarily in the chemicals industry.

Other Income Statement Variances

2014 Compared to 2013

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

•a decrease of $20.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in September 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;

•a decrease of $7.2 million due to costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the Utility’s transmission business; and

•a decrease of $2.3 million in loss reserves.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•an increase of $6.9 million due to administration fees in 2014 related to participation in the MISO RTO. The LPSC approved deferral of these expenses resulting in no net income effect;

•an increase of $3.6 million in outside regulatory, consulting, and legal fees;

•an increase of $1.7 million in customer service costs primarily due to write-offs in 2014 of uncollectible customer accounts; and 

•several individually insignificant items.

325
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher residential and commercial revenues as compared to prior year and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.

Other income decreased primarily due to higher realized gains in 2013 on the River Bend decommissioning trust fund investments. There is no effect on net income as these investment gains are offset by a corresponding amount of regulatory charges.

Interest expense increased primarily due to $3.6 million of carrying charges recorded in 2014 on storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Isaac, as approved by the LPSC, and the issuance of $110 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2014.

2013 Compared to 2012

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•an increase of $15 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs and a settlement charge, recognized in September 2013, related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;

•the deferral recorded in the second quarter 2012, as approved by the LPSC and the FERC, of costs related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO, which reduced expenses by $4.2 million in 2012;

•an increase of $13.5 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative, partially offset by the deferral, as approved by the LPSC, of $9.8 million of these costs. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion;

•an increase of $3.5 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall higher scope of work done during plant outages as compared to the prior year; 

•an increase of $2.9 million in loss reserves; and

•several individually insignificant items.

Also, other operation and maintenance expenses include $7.2 million in 2013 and $4.7 million in 2012 of costs incurred related to the now terminated plan to spin off and merge the transmission business. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher residential and commercial revenues as compared to prior year and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. Franchise taxes have no effect on net income as these taxes are recovered through the franchise tax rider.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to increased plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to higher realized gains in 2013 on the River Bend decommissioning trust fund investments. There is no effect on net income as these investment gains are offset by a corresponding amount of regulatory charges.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 35.3%, 26%, and 24.9% for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $157.8 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•proceeds of $69 million received from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation as a result of the Louisiana Act 55 storm cost financing. See Note 2 to the financial statements and “Hurricane Isaac” below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;

•lower nuclear refueling outage spending at River Bend. River Bend had a refueling outage in 2013 and did not have one in 2014; and

•the timing of collections from customers.

The increase was partially offset by an increase of $18.6 million in pension contributions in 2014. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $88.5 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•a decrease of $84.1 million in income tax payments in 2013 compared to 2012. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana had income tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. In 2013, the payments resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana had previously claimed a tax deduction. In 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana no longer had a net operating loss carryover from prior years to reduce current taxable income; and

•decreased Hurricane Isaac storm spending in 2013.

The increase was partially offset by higher nuclear refueling outage spending at River Bend. River Bend had a refueling outage in 2013 and did not have one in 2012.

327
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $54.6 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•the deposit in 2014 of $68.5 million into the storm escrow account;

•the investment in 2014 of $66.2 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See Note 2 to the financial statements and “Hurricane Isaac” below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;

•the withdrawal of $65.5 million from the storm reserve escrow account in 2013; and

•an increase in fossil-fueled generation expenditures as a result of an increased scope of work in 2014.

The increase was partially offset by:

•fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle;

•a decrease in nuclear construction expenditures as a result of spending on nuclear projects during the River Bend refueling outage in 2013. River Bend had a refueling outage in 2013 and did not have one in 2014; and

•a decrease in transmission construction expenditures due to a decreased scope of work performed in 2014.

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $135.2 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle;

•$51 million in proceeds in 2012 from the sale of a portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s investment in Entergy Holdings Company’s Class A preferred membership interests to a third party. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s investment in Entergy Holdings Company’s Class A preferred membership interests;

•money pool activity;

•an increase in nuclear construction expenditures as a result of spending on nuclear projects during the River Bend refueling outage in 2013; and

•an increase in transmission construction expenditures due to additional reliability work performed in 2013. 

The increase was partially offset by:

•the withdrawal of $65.5 million from the storm reserve escrow account in 2013;

•a decrease in distribution construction expenditures due to prior year Hurricane Isaac spending; and

•a decrease in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures as a result of decreased scope of work in 2013.

Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool increased by $1.9 million in 2013 compared to decreasing by $23.6 million in 2012. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility operating companies’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana includes specific investments, such as the Union Power Station acquisition discussed below; NRC post-Fukushima requirements; environmental compliance spending; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; resource planning; generation projects; system improvements; and other investments. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 

Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements.

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s long-term debt indenture contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests.

Union Power Station Purchase Agreement

In December 2014, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Texas entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, a 1,980 MW (summer rating) power generation facility located near El Dorado, Arkansas, from Union Power Partners, L.P. The Union Power Station consists of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating). Pursuant to the agreement, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will acquire two of the power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility, and Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas will each acquire one power block and a 25% undivided ownership interest in such related assets. (If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Texas do not obtain approval for the purchase of their power blocks, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will seek to purchase the power blocks not approved.) The base purchase price is expected to be approximately $948 million (approximately $237 million for each power block) subject to adjustments. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates selling 20% of the capacity and energy associated with its two power blocks to Entergy New Orleans through a cost-based, life-of-unit power purchase agreement. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC, LPSC, PUCT, and FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In December 2014, Entergy Texas filed its application with the PUCT for approval of the acquisition. The PUCT has indicated that it will convene the hearing on the merits of this case in June 2015. Entergy Texas intends to file a rate application to seek cost recovery later in 2015. In January 2015, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed its application with the LPSC and Entergy Arkansas filed its application with the APSC, each for approval of the acquisition and cost recovery. Closing is targeted to occur in late-2015.

New Nuclear Development

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana have been developing and are preserving a project option for new nuclear generation at River Bend. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project.

In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the limited development activities necessary to preserve an option to construct a new unit at River Bend. 

331
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

At its June 2012 meeting the LPSC voted to uphold an ALJ recommendation that the request of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana be declined on the basis that the LPSC’s rule on new nuclear development does not apply to activities to preserve an option to develop and on the further grounds that the companies improperly engaged in advanced preparation activities prior to certification. The LPSC directed that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana be permitted to seek recovery of these costs in their upcoming rate case filings that were subsequently filed in February 2013. In the resolution of the rate case proceeding, the LPSC provided for an eight-year amortization of costs incurred in connection with the potential development of a new nuclear generation at River Bend, without carrying costs, beginning in December 2014, provided, however, that amortization of these costs shall not result in a future rate increase. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each have a regulatory asset of $29.2 million on its balance sheet related to these new nuclear generation development costs.

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred equity/membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred equity/membership interest issuances by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred equity/membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

In July 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $110 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds due April 2025. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana used the proceeds to re-establish and replenish its storm damage escrow reserves and for general corporate purposes.

Hurricane Isaac

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused extensive damage to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In January 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana drew $65 million from its funded storm reserve escrow accounts. In April 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed a joint application with the LPSC relating to Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs. In May 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Louisiana Act 55). The LPSC Staff filed direct testimony in September 2013 concluding that Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana were reasonable and prudent, subject to proposed minor adjustments which totaled approximately 1% of each company’s costs. Following an evidentiary hearing and recommendations by the ALJ, the LPSC voted in June 2014 to approve a series of orders which (i) quantify the amount of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs prudently incurred ($66.5 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $224.3 million for Entergy Louisiana); (ii) determine the level of storm reserves to be re-established ($90 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $200 million for Entergy Louisiana); (iii) authorize Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana to utilize Louisiana Act 55 financing for Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs; and (iv) grant other requested relief associated with storm reserves and Act 55 financing of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of $6.9 million of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately $1.4 million for five years. Approvals for the Act 55 financings were obtained from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC) and the Louisiana State Bond Commission.

In July 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $110 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds due April 2025 and used the proceeds to re-establish and replenish its storm damage escrow reserves and for general corporate purposes. In August 2014 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $71 million in bonds under Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature. From the $69 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $3 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $66 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana used the $66 million received from the LURC to acquire 662,426.80 Class C preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 7.5% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2014, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1.75 billion.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service

the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state.

Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 is a nominally-sized 560 MW unit that is expected to cost approximately $655 million to construct when spending is complete, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 25% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. In March 2012 the LPSC unanimously voted to grant the certifications requested by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. Following approval by the LPSC, Entergy Louisiana issued full notice to proceed to the project’s engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. 

Under the terms approved by the LPSC, non-fuel costs may be recovered through Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan beginning in the month after the unit is placed in service. In July 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an unopposed stipulation with the LPSC that estimates a first year revenue requirement associated with Ninemile 6 and provides a mechanism to update the revenue requirement as the in-service date approaches, which was subsequently approved by the LPSC. In late December 2014, roughly contemporaneous with the unit’s placement in service, a final updated estimated revenue requirement of $26.8 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana was filed. The December 2014 estimate forms the basis of rates implemented effective with the first billing cycle of January 2015. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Retail Rates - Electric

In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan. In May 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2011 test year. The filing reflected an 11.94% earned return on common equity, which was above the earnings bandwidth and indicated a $6.5 million cost of service rate decrease was necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflected a $22.9 million rate decrease for the incremental capacity rider. Subsequently, in August 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted a revised filing that reflected an earned return on common equity of 11.86%, which indicated a $5.7 million cost of service rate decrease was necessary under the formula rate plan. The revised filing also indicated that a reduction of $20.3 million should be reflected in the incremental capacity rider. The rate reductions were implemented, subject to refund, effective for bills rendered in the first billing cycle of September 2012. Subsequently, in December 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted a revised evaluation report that reflected expected retail jurisdictional cost of $17 million for the first-year capacity charges for the purchase from Entergy Louisiana of one-third of Acadia Unit 2 capacity and energy. This rate change was implemented effective with the first billing cycle of January 2013. The 2011 test year filings, as revised, were approved by the LPSC in February 2013. In April 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted a revised evaluation report increasing the incremental capacity rider by approximately $7.3 million to reflect the cost of an additional capacity contract. 

334
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In connection with its decision to extend the formula rate plan to the 2011 test year, the LPSC required that a base rate case be filed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and the required filing was made in February 2013. The filing anticipated Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s integration into MISO. In the filing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana requested, among other relief:

•authorization to increase the revenue it collects from customers by approximately $24 million;

•an authorized return on common equity of 10.4%;

•authorization to increase depreciation rates embedded in the proposed revenue requirement; and,[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Following a hearing before an ALJ and the ALJ’s issuance of a Report of Proceedings, in December 2013 the LPSC approved an unopposed settlement of the proceeding. Major terms of the settlement include approval of a three-year formula rate plan (effective for test years 2014-2016) modeled after the formula rate plan in effect for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana for 2011, including the following: (1) a midpoint return on equity of 9.95% plus or minus 80 basis points, with 60/40 sharing of earnings outside of the bandwidth; (2) recovery outside of the sharing mechanism for the non-fuel MISO-related costs, additional capacity revenue requirement, extraordinary items, such as the Ninemile 6 project, and certain special recovery items; (3) three-year amortization of costs to achieve savings associated with the human capital management strategic imperative, with savings to be reflected as they are realized in subsequent years; (4) eight-year amortization of costs incurred in connection with potential development of a new nuclear unit at River Bend, without carrying costs, beginning December 2014, provided, however, that amortization of these costs shall not result in a future rate increase; (5) no change in rates related to test year 2013, except with respect to recovery of the non-fuel MISO-related costs and any changes to the additional capacity revenue requirement; and (6) no increase in rates related to test year 2014, except for those items eligible for recovery outside of the earnings sharing mechanism. Existing depreciation rates will not change. Implementation of rate changes for items recoverable outside of the earnings sharing mechanism occurred in December 2014. 

Pursuant to the rate case settlement approved by the LPSC in December 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted a compliance filing in May 2014 reflecting the effects of the estimated MISO cost recovery mechanism revenue requirement and adjustment of the additional capacity mechanism. In November 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted an additional compliance filing updating the estimated MISO cost recovery mechanism for the most recent actual data. Based on this updated filing, a net increase of $5.8 million in formula rate plan revenue to be collected over nine months was implemented in December 2014. The compliance filings are subject to the review in accordance with the review process set forth in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan. 

Retail Rates - Gas

In January 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2011. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.48%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5%, plus or minus fifty basis points. In April 2012 the LPSC Staff filed its findings, suggesting adjustments that produced an 11.54% earned return on common equity for the test year and a $0.1 million rate reduction. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana accepted the LPSC Staff’s recommendations, and the rate reduction was effective with the first billing cycle of May 2012.

In January 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 11.18%, which results in 

335
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

a $43 thousand rate reduction. In March 2013 the LPSC Staff issued its proposed findings and recommended two adjustments. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff reached agreement regarding the LPSC Staff’s proposed adjustments. As reflected in an unopposed joint report of proceedings filed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff in May 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana accepted, with modification, the LPSC Staff’s proposed adjustment to property insurance expense and agreed to: (1) a three-year extension of the gas rate stabilization plan with a midpoint return on equity of 9.95%, with a first year midpoint reset; (2) dismissal of a docket initiated by the LPSC to evaluate the allowed return on equity for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s gas rate stabilization plan; and (3) presentation to the LPSC by November 2014 by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff of their recommendation for implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated with strategic plant investment. The LPSC approved the agreement in May 2013.

In January 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2013. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 5.47% which results in a $1.5 million rate increase. In April 2014 the LPSC Staff issued a report indicating “that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has properly determined its earnings for the test year ended September 30, 2013.” The $1.5 million rate increase was implemented effective with the first billing cycle of April 2014.

In accordance with the settlement of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012, in August 2014 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal for implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated with strategic plant investment and relocation projects mandated by local governments. After review by the LPSC staff and inclusion of certain customer safeguards required by the LPSC staff, in December 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint settlement for implementation of an accelerated gas pipe replacement program providing for the replacement of approximately 100 miles of pipe over the next ten years, as well as relocation of certain existing pipe resulting from local government-related infrastructure projects, and for a rider to recover the investment associated with these projects. The rider allows for recovery of approximately $65 million over ten years. The rider recovery will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to include actual investment incurred for the prior quarter and is subject to the following conditions, among others: a ten-year term; application of any earnings in excess of 10.45% as an offset to the revenue requirement of the infrastructure rider; adherence to a specified spending plan, within plus or minus 20 percent annually; annual filings comparing actual versus planned rider spending with actual spending and explanation of variances exceeding ten percent; and an annual true-up. The joint settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2015. Implementation of the infrastructure rider will commence with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April 2015.

In January 2015, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2014. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 7.20%, which results in a $706 thousand rate increase. The rate increase, if approved, will be implemented effective with the first billing cycle of April 2015.

Fuel and purchased power cost recovery

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to the billing month. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

In December 2011 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 2005 through 2009. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established.

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013. Discovery has yet to commence.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.

Federal Regulation

See “Entergy’s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization,” “System Agreement,” and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics.

Nuclear Matters

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend nuclear power plant. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to River Bend and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in July 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. The task force then issued a second report in September 2011. Based upon the task force’s recommendations, the NRC issued three orders effective on March 12, 2012. The three orders require U.S. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. The NRC, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the NRC orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uses of Capital” above.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Environmental Risks

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

In the fourth quarter 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for River Bend as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $20 million increase in the decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the unit. 

Unbilled Revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2014 was $18.6 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $27.5 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana contributed $30.2 million to its pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $32.5 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2014 were $12.2 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs of approximately $13.1 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana contributed $8.3 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million in 2015.

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $51.3 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $11.8 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $7.6 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $1.6 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination

In June 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a business combination study report with the LPSC. The report contained a preliminary analysis of the potential combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana into a single public utility, including an overview of the combination that identified its potential customer benefits. Although not part of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana provided notice to the City Council in June 2014 that it would seek authorization to transfer to Entergy New Orleans the assets that currently support the provision of service to Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers. Entergy Louisiana subsequently filed the referenced application with the City Council in October 2014. In the summer of 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana held technical conferences and face-to-face meetings with LPSC staff and other stakeholders to discuss potential effects of the combination, solicit suggestions and concerns, and identify areas in which additional information might be needed. 

On September 30, 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking authorization to undertake the transactions that would result in the combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana into a single public utility. 

The combination is subject to regulatory review and approval of the LPSC, the FERC, and the NRC. In June 2014, Entergy submitted an application to the NRC for approval of River Bend and Waterford 3 license transfers as part of the steps to complete the business combination. The combination also could be subject to regulatory review of the City Council if Entergy Louisiana continues to own the assets that currently support Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers at the time the combination is effectuated. In November 2014, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake the combination. The application provides that if the City Council approves the Algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the City Council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the combination. In December 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed applications with the FERC requesting authorization for the business combination and the Algiers asset transfer. In January 2015, Entergy Services filed an application with the FERC for financing authority for the combined company. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC, the FERC, the NRC, and, if required, the City Council, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expect the combination will be effected in the second half of 2015.

The procedural schedule in the LPSC business combination proceeding calls for LPSC Staff and intervenor testimony to be filed in March 2015, with a hearing scheduled for June 2015. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana have requested that the LPSC issue its decision regarding the business combination in August 2015. In the City Council business combination proceeding, the City Council announced through a resolution that it would not initiate an active review of the business combination filing, but instead would establish a business combination docket for the limited purpose of receiving information filings relative to the business combination proceedings at the LPSC.

It is currently contemplated that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will undertake multiple steps to effectuate the combination, which steps would include the following:

•Each of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will redeem or repurchase all of their respective outstanding preferred membership interests (which interests have a $100 million liquidation value in the case of Entergy Louisiana and $10 million liquidation value in the case of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana).

•Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will convert from a Louisiana limited liability company to a Texas limited liability company.

•Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Louisiana will allocate substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Louisiana) and New Entergy Louisiana will assume all 

350
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

of the liabilities of Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Louisiana will remain in existence and hold the membership interests in New Entergy Louisiana.

•Under the TXBOC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will allocate substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will assume all of the liabilities of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will remain in existence and hold the membership interests in New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

•Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will contribute the membership interests in New Entergy Louisiana and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to an affiliate the common membership interests of which will be owned by Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Corporation.

•New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will merge into New Entergy Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger.

Upon the completion of the steps, New Entergy Louisiana will hold substantially all of the assets, and will have assumed all of the liabilities, of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may modify or supplement the steps to be taken to effect the combination.

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income increased $31.1 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher interest expense.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income decreased $28.6 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher interest expense, and higher nuclear refueling outage expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue. Also contributing to the decrease in net income was the settlement of the tax treatment related to the Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita Louisiana Act 55 financing in June 2012, which resulted in a $142.7 million reduction of income tax expense partially offset by a $137.1 million ($84.3 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge, which reduced net revenue in 2012. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net Revenue

2014 Compared to 2013

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The MISO deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of non-fuel MISO-related charges, as approved by the LPSC. The deferral of non-fuel MISO-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the recovery of non-fuel MISO-related charges.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in affiliated purchased power capacity costs that are recovered through base rates set in the annual formula rate plan mechanism and a formula rate plan increase effective December 2014. Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

The asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because Entergy Louisiana records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. The variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings, increases in depreciation and accretion expenses, and an increase in regulatory credits to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 682 GWh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales as compared to the prior year and an increase in industrial usage primarily due to increased consumption by a large industrial customer in the chemicals industry as a result of a prior year plant outage and the addition of new mid-small industrial customers.

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Louisiana Act 55 financing savings obligation variance results from a regulatory charge recorded in the second quarter 2012 because Entergy Louisiana was required to share with customers the savings from the tax treatment related to the Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita Louisiana Act 55 financing. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective January 2013. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan increase.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 512 GWh in billed electricity usage in all sectors due to the effect of more favorable weather as compared to the previous year on residential sales and the effect of Hurricane Isaac, which decreased sales volume in 2012. The increase in industrial usage was also driven by a higher capacity factor in the petroleum industry. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to the sale to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana of one-third of Acadia Unit 2 capacity and energy.

The fuel recovery variance is primarily due to the expiration of the Evangeline gas contract on January 1, 2013.

Other Income Statement Variances

2014 Compared to 2013 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•a $16 million write-off recorded in 2014 because of the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project prudence review. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the prudence review;

•an increase of $10.5 million due to administration fees related to the participation in the MISO RTO effective December 2013. The LPSC approved deferral of these expenses resulting in no net income effect;

•an increase of $9.7 million in regulatory, consulting, and legal fees;

•an increase of $7.9 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher labor costs, including contract labor, higher materials costs, and higher NRC fees;

353
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•an increase of $7.3 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to an overall higher scope of work done during plant outages as compared to prior year; 

•an increase of $4.4 million in transmission expenses primarily due to increased transmission equalization expenses and higher vegetation maintenance;

•an increase of $2.1 million as a result of higher write-offs of uncollectible accounts in 2014; 

•an increase of $1.7 million in distribution vegetation maintenance expenses; and

•several individually insignificant items.

The increase was partially offset by:

•a decrease of $24 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in September 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;

•a decrease of $6.1 million relating to the sale of surplus oil inventory in 2014; and

•a decrease of $5.9 million due to costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the Utility’s transmission business.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to:

•an increase of $9.5 million due to distributions earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received in August 2014 from the Act 55 storm cost financing. See Note 2 to the financial statements and “Hurricane Isaac” below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;

•$7.6 million of carrying charges recorded in 2014 on storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Isaac as approved by the LPSC; and

•the increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction due to a higher construction work in progress balance in 2014, including the Ninemile Unit 6 Self-Build Project. 

The increase was partially offset by higher realized gains in 2013 on Waterford 3 decommissioning trust fund investments.

Interest expense increased primarily due to:

•the issuance of $325 million of 4.05% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013;

•the issuance of $170 million of 5.0% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2014; and

•the issuance of $190 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2014.

The increase was partially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to a higher construction work in progress balance in 2014, including the Ninemile Unit 6 Self-Build Project.

2013 Compared to 2012

Nuclear refueling outage expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with the refueling outage at Waterford 3.

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•an increase of $20.9 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in the discount

rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs and a settlement charge, recognized in September 2013, related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;

•an increase of $16.5 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative, substantially offset by the deferral, as approved by the LPSC, of $13 million of these costs. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion;

•an increase of $5.4 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher labor and materials costs; and

•the prior year deferral, as approved by the LPSC and the FERC, of costs related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO, which reduced 2012 expenses by $5.2 million.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $9.2 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall lower scope of work done during plant outages as compared to the prior year. 

Also, other operation and maintenance expenses include $5.9 million in 2013 and $6.7 million in 2012 of costs incurred related to the now terminated plan to spin off and merge the transmission business.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including placing in service the Waterford 3 steam generator project in December 2012.

Interest expense increased primarily due to:

•the issuance of $200 million of 5.25% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2012;

•the issuance of $200 million of 3.30% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2012;

•the issuance of $100 million of 4.70% Series first mortgage bonds in May 2013; and

•the issuance of $325 million of 4.05% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012, were 25.3%, 24.5%, and (84.7%), respectively. The effective income tax rate of (84.7%) for 2012 was primarily due to the settlement of the tax treatment of the Louisiana Act 55 financing of the Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs and the reversal of the provision for the uncertain tax positions related to that item. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates and for a discussion of the IRS settlement and audits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $463.3 million in 2014 primarily due to proceeds of $240 million received from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation as a result of the Louisiana Act 55 storm cost financing, an increase in income tax refunds of $207.8 million, and the timing of collections from customers. The increase was partially offset by an increase of $33.4 million in pension contributions in 2014 and an increase of $15.6 million in interest paid resulting from an increase in interest expense, as discussed above. Entergy Louisiana had income tax refunds in 2014 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds are primarily due to favorable adjustments allowed in the IRS Audit of the 2006-2007 tax years and a carryback of a 2008 net operating loss. See Note 2 to the financial statements and “Hurricane Isaac” below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $215.1 million in 2013 primarily due to decreased Hurricane Isaac storm spending in 2013 and a decrease of $7.7 million in pension contributions. The increase was partially offset by an increase of $12.4 million in interest paid resulting from the increase in interest expense, as discussed above, and a decrease of $7.8 million in income tax refunds. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $398 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•the investment in 2014 of $227 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See Note 2 to the financial statements and “Hurricane Isaac” below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; 

•the deposit of $200 million into the storm reserve escrow account in 2014;

•receipts of $187 million from the storm reserve escrow account in 2013; 

•an increase in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and

356
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•an increase in transmission construction expenditures as a result of additional reliability work performed in 2014.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures due to lower spending on the Ninemile Unit 6 self-rebuild project and money pool activity.

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $16 million in 2014 compared to increasing by $8.2 million in 2013. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $310.1 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•receipts of $187 million from the storm reserve escrow account in 2013 compared to receipts of $14.5 million in 2012;

•a decrease in nuclear construction expenditures due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project in 2012;

•a decrease in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and

•a decrease in distribution construction expenditures due to higher Hurricane Isaac spending in prior year.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures due to spending on the Ninemile Unit 6 self-build project and an increase in transmission construction expenditures as a result of additional reliability work performed in 2013. 

Financing Activities

Net cash used by financing activities increased $125.7 million in 2014 primarily due to the net issuance of $130.7 million of long-term debt in 2014 compared to the net issuance of $386.9 million of long-term debt in 2013, partially offset by borrowings of $43.1 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility in 2014 compared to the repayment of borrowings of $51.7 million in 2013 and a decrease of $35.7 million in common equity distributions in 2014. 

Entergy Louisiana’s financing activities used $28 million of cash in 2013 compared to providing $432.4 million of cash in 2012 primarily due to:

•an increase of $340.7 million in common equity distributions in 2013;

•the net issuance of $386.9 million of long-term debt in 2013 compared to the net issuance of $613.1 million of long-term debt in 2012; and 

•money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool decreased by $118.4 million in 2012.

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Capital Structure

Entergy Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Louisiana is primarily due to an increase in long-term debt as a result of the issuance of $190 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Louisiana.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition. Entergy Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluation Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Louisiana’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for:

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt and preferred equity maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•distribution and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $57 million to its pension plans and approximately $9.9 million to other postretirement plans in 2015, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $38.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana includes specific investments such as NRC post-Fukushima requirements; environmental compliance spending; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; resource planning; generation projects; system improvements; and other investments. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 

Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements.

As an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Louisiana’s long-term debt indenture contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. 

Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project 

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 is a nominally-sized 560 MW unit that is expected to cost approximately $655 million to construct when spending is complete, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 25% of the capacity and energy

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. In March 2012 the LPSC unanimously voted to grant the certifications requested by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. Following approval by the LPSC, Entergy Louisiana issued full notice to proceed to the project’s engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. 

Under terms approved by the LPSC, non-fuel costs may be recovered through Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan beginning in the month after the unit is placed in service. In July 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an unopposed stipulation with the LPSC that estimates a first year revenue requirement associated with Ninemile 6 and provides a mechanism to update the revenue requirement as the in-service date approaches, which was subsequently approved by the LPSC. In late December 2014, roughly contemporaneous with the unit’s placement in service, a final updated estimated revenue requirement of $51.1 million for Entergy Louisiana was filed. The December 2014 estimate forms the basis of rates implemented effective with the first billing cycle of January 2015. Entergy Louisiana will submit project and cost information to the LPSC in mid-2015 to enable the LPSC to review the prudence of Entergy Louisiana’s management of the project.

New Nuclear Development

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana have been developing and are preserving a project option for new nuclear generation at River Bend. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project.

In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the limited development activities necessary to preserve an option to construct a new unit at River Bend. At its June 2012 meeting the LPSC voted to uphold an ALJ recommendation that the request of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana be declined on the basis that the LPSC’s rule on new nuclear development does not apply to activities to preserve an option to develop and on the further grounds that the companies improperly engaged in advanced preparation activities prior to certification. The LPSC directed that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana be permitted to seek recovery of these costs in their upcoming rate case filings that were subsequently filed in February 2013. In the resolution of the rate case proceeding, the LPSC provided for an eight-year amortization of costs incurred in connection with the potential development of a new nuclear generation at River Bend, without carrying costs, beginning in December 2014, provided, however, that amortization of these costs shall not result in a future rate increase. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each have a regulatory asset of $29.2 million on its balance sheet related to these new nuclear generation development costs.

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and distribution rates are favorable.

360
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Louisiana’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $200 million scheduled to expire in March 2019. The credit facility allows Entergy Louisiana to issue letters of credit against 50% of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2014, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facility. In addition, Entergy Louisiana entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility in 2014 as a means to post collateral to support its obligations under MISO. As of December 31, 2014, a $4.7 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Louisiana’s letter of credit facility. 

The Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $90 million scheduled to expire in June 2016. As of December 31, 2014, $46.1 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility to support a like amount of commercial paper issued by the Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility. 

Entergy Louisiana obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2015 for the following:

•short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $250 million at any time outstanding;

•long-term borrowings and security issuances; and

•long-term borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. 

See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits.

In February 2014 the Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entity issued $40 million of 3.92% Series H Notes due February 2021. The Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entity used the proceeds to purchase additional nuclear fuel.

In June 2014, Entergy Louisiana issued $170 million of 5% Series first mortgage bonds due July 2044. Entergy Louisiana used the proceeds to pay, prior to maturity, its $70 million 6.4% Series first mortgage bonds due October 2034 and to pay, prior to maturity, its $100 million 6.3% Series first mortgage bonds due September 2035.

In July 2014, Entergy Louisiana issued $190 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds due April 2025. Entergy Louisiana used the proceeds to re-establish and replenish its storm damage escrow reserves and for general corporate purposes.

In July 2014 the Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entity redeemed, at maturity, its $50 million of 5.69% Series E Notes.

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In November 2014, Entergy Louisiana issued $250 million of 4.95% Series first mortgage bonds due January 2045. Entergy Louisiana used the proceeds to repay, at maturity, its $250 million of 1.875% Series first mortgage bonds due December 2014.

Hurricane Isaac 

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused extensive damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In January 2013, Entergy Louisiana drew $187 million from its funded storm reserve escrow account. In April 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed a joint application with the LPSC relating to Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs. In May 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Louisiana Act 55). The LPSC Staff filed direct testimony in September 2013 concluding that Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana were reasonable and prudent, subject to proposed minor adjustments which totaled approximately 1% of each company’s costs. Following an evidentiary hearing and recommendations by the ALJ, the LPSC voted in June 2014 to approve a series of orders which (i) quantify the amount of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs prudently incurred ($66.5 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $224.3 million for Entergy Louisiana); (ii) determine the level of storm reserves to be re-established ($90 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $200 million for Entergy Louisiana); (iii) authorize Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana to utilize Louisiana Act 55 financing for Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs; and (iv) grant other requested relief associated with storm reserves and Act 55 financing of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs. Entergy Louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of $23.9 million of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately $4.8 million for five years. Approvals for the Act 55 financings were obtained from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC) and the Louisiana State Bond Commission.

In July 2014, Entergy Louisiana issued $190 million of 3.78% Series first mortgage bonds due April 2025 and used the proceeds to re-establish and replenish its storm damage escrow reserves and for general corporate purposes.

In August 2014 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $243.85 million in bonds under Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature. From the $240 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $13 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $227 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana used the $227 million received from the LURC to acquire 2,272,725.89 Class C preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 7.5% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2014, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1.75 billion.

Entergy Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and there is no recourse against Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state.

Little Gypsy Repowering Project

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant. In March 2009 the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to 

362
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project’s economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. This action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. In April 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC’s directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. In May 2009 the LPSC issued an order declaring that Entergy Louisiana’s decision to place the Little Gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent.

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the Little Gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period. In June 2010 and August 2010, the LPSC Staff and Intervenors filed testimony. The LPSC Staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the LPSC may want to consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the LPSC may consider ordering no return; and (5) indicated that Entergy Louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. In the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, Entergy Louisiana determined that it was probable that the Little Gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset. A hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the ALJ in November 2010. In January 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation. The settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover $200 million as of March 31, 2011, and carrying costs on that amount on specified terms thereafter. The settlement also provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization. In April 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to authorize the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the project and to issue a financing order by which Entergy Louisiana could accomplish such securitization. In August 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the September 2011 issuance of the securitization bonds.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 

The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Retail Rates

Filings with the LPSC

In May 2005 the LPSC approved a rate filing settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana. The initial formula rate plan filing was made in May 2006. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 test years.

In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan. In May 2012, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2011 test year. The filing reflected a 9.63% earned return on common equity, which is within the earnings bandwidth and resulted in no cost of service rate 

363
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

change under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflected an $18.1 million rate increase for the incremental capacity rider. In August 2012, Entergy Louisiana submitted a revised filing that reflected an earned return on common equity of 10.38%, which is still within the earnings bandwidth, resulting in no cost of service rate change. The revised filing also indicated that an increase of $15.9 million should be reflected in the incremental capacity rider. The rate change was implemented, subject to refund, effective for bills rendered the first billing cycle of September 2012. Subsequently, in December 2012, Entergy Louisiana submitted a revised evaluation report that reflected two items: 1) a $17 million reduction for the first-year capacity charges for the purchase by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from Entergy Louisiana of one-third of Acadia Unit 2 capacity and energy, and 2) an $88 million increase for the first-year retail revenue requirement associated with the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, which was in-service in December 2012. These rate changes were implemented, subject to refund, effective with the first billing cycle of January 2013. In April 2013, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed a joint report resolving the 2011 test year formula rate plan and recovery related to the Grand Gulf uprate. This report was approved by the LPSC in April 2013. 

With completion of the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the LPSC is conducting a prudence review in connection with a filing made by Entergy Louisiana in April 2013 with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. In July 2014 the LPSC Staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to $71 million, citing a need for further explanation or documentation from Entergy Louisiana. An intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of $141 million of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent. Entergy Louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the LPSC staff. An evidentiary hearing was held in December 2014. At the hearing the parties maintained the positions reflected in pre-filed testimony. A post-hearing briefing schedule has not been established. Entergy Louisiana believes that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles support their recovery in rates. Nevertheless, Entergy Louisiana recorded a write-off of $16 million of Waterford 3’s plant balance in December 2014 because of the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the prudence review.

In connection with its decision to extend the formula rate plan to the 2011 test year, the LPSC required that a base rate case be filed by Entergy Louisiana, and the required filing was made on February 15, 2013. The filing anticipated Entergy Louisiana’s integration into MISO. In the filing Entergy Louisiana requested, among other relief:

•authorization to increase the revenue it collects from customers by approximately $145 million (which does not take into account a revenue offset of approximately $2 million resulting from a proposed increase for those customers taking service under the Qualifying Facility Standby Service);

•an authorized return on common equity of 10.4%;

•authorization to increase depreciation rates embedded in the proposed revenue requirement; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Following a hearing before an ALJ and the ALJ’s issuance of a Report of Proceedings, in December 2013 the LPSC approved an unopposed settlement of the proceeding. The settlement provides for a $10 million rate increase effective with the first billing cycle of December 2014. Major terms of the settlement include approval of a three-year formula rate plan (effective for test years 2014-2016) modeled after the formula rate plan in effect for Entergy Louisiana for 2011, including the following: (1) a midpoint return on equity of 9.95% plus or minus 80 basis points, with 60/40 sharing of earnings outside of the bandwidth; (2) recovery outside of the sharing mechanism for the non-fuel MISO-related costs, additional capacity revenue requirement, extraordinary items, such as the Ninemile 6 project, and certain 

364
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

special recovery items; (3) three-year amortization of costs to achieve savings associated with the human capital management strategic imperative, with savings reflected as they are realized in subsequent years; (4) eight-year amortization of costs incurred in connection with potential development of a new nuclear unit at River Bend, without carrying costs, beginning December 2014, provided, however, that amortization of these costs shall not result in a future rate increase; (5) recovery of non-fuel MISO-related costs and any changes to the additional capacity revenue requirement related to test year 2013 effective with the first billing cycle of December 2014; and (6) a cumulative $30 million cap on cost of service increases over the three-year formula rate plan cycle, except for those items outside of the sharing mechanism. Existing depreciation rates will not change. 

Pursuant to the rate case settlement approved by the LPSC in December 2013, Entergy Louisiana submitted a compliance filing in May 2014 reflecting the effects of the $10 million agreed-upon increase in formula rate plan revenue, the estimated MISO cost recovery mechanism revenue requirement, and the adjustment of the additional capacity mechanism. In November 2014, Entergy Louisiana submitted an additional compliance filing updating the estimated MISO cost recovery mechanism for the most recent actual data, as well as providing for a refund and prospective reduction in rates for the true-up of the estimated revenue requirement for the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project. Based on this updated filing, a net increase of $41.7 million in formula rate plan revenue to be collected over nine months was implemented in December 2014. The compliance filings are subject to the review in accordance with the review process set forth in Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan. Additionally, the adjustments of rates made related to the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project included in the December 2014 compliance filing are subject to final true-up following completion of the LPSC’s determination regarding the prudence of the project. 

Filings with the City Council

In March 2013, Entergy Louisiana filed a rate case for the Algiers area, which is in New Orleans and is regulated by the City Council. Entergy Louisiana requested a rate increase of $13 million over three years, including a 10.4% return on common equity and a formula rate plan mechanism identical to its LPSC request made in February 2013. In January 2014, the City Council Advisors filed direct testimony recommending a rate increase of $5.56 million over three years, including an 8.13% return on common equity. In June 2014 the City Council unanimously approved a settlement that includes the following:

•a $9.3 million base rate revenue increase to be phased in on a levelized basis over four years;

•recovery of an additional $853 thousand annually through a MISO recovery rider; and

•adoption of a four-year formula rate plan requiring the filing of annual evaluation reports in May of each year, commencing May 2015, with resulting rates being implemented in October of each year. The formula rate plan includes a midpoint target authorized return on common equity of 9.95% with a +/- 40 basis point bandwidth.

The rate increase was effective with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of July 2014. Additional compliance filings were made with the Council in October 2014 for approval of the form of certain rate riders, including among others, a Ninemile 6 non-fuel cost recovery interim rider, allowing for contemporaneous recovery of capacity costs related to the commencement of commercial operation of the Ninemile 6 generating unit and a purchased power capacity cost recovery rider. The Ninemile 6 cost recovery interim rider was implemented in December 2014 to collect $915 thousand from Entergy Louisiana customers in the Algiers area.

Fuel and purchased power recovery

Entergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to the billing month. 

In April 2010 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through the fuel adjustment clause by 

365
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Louisiana for the period from 2005 through 2009. The LPSC Staff issued its audit report in January 2013. The LPSC staff recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately $1.9 million, plus interest, to customers and realign the recovery of approximately $1 million from Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause to base rates. The recommended refund was made by Entergy Louisiana in May 2013 in the form of a credit to customers through its fuel adjustment clause filing. Two parties intervened in the proceeding. A procedural schedule was established for the identification of issues by the intervenors and for Entergy Louisiana to submit comments regarding the LPSC Staff report and any issues raised by intervenors. One intervenor is seeking further proceedings regarding certain issues it raised in its comments on the LPSC Staff report. Entergy Louisiana has filed responses to both the LPSC Staff report and the issues raised by the intervenor. As required by the procedural schedule, a joint status report was submitted in October 2013 by the parties. A status conference was held in December 2013. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established.

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013. Discovery has yet to commence.

Algiers Asset Transfer

In October 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake a transaction that would result in the transfer from Entergy Louisiana to Entergy New Orleans of certain assets that currently support the provision of service to Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers. The transaction is expected to result in the transfer of net assets of approximately $60 million. The Algiers asset transfer is also subject to regulatory review and approval of the FERC. As discussed previously, Entergy Louisiana also filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake the Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana business combination. The application provides that if the City Council approves the Algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the City Council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the business combination. If the necessary approvals are obtained from the City Council and the FERC, Entergy Louisiana expects to transfer the Algiers assets to Entergy New Orleans in the second half of 2015. In November 2014 the City Council approved a resolution establishing a procedural schedule that provides for a hearing on the joint application in late-May 2015, with a decision to be rendered no later than June 2015.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

Entergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.

Federal Regulation

Nuclear Matters

Entergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in July 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. The task force then issued a second report in September 2011. Based upon the task force’s recommendations, the NRC issued three orders effective on March 12, 2012. The three orders require U.S. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. The NRC, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. Entergy Louisiana’s estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the NRC orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uses of Capital” above.

Environmental Risks

Entergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

367
Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In the fourth quarter 2013, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Waterford 3 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $39.4 million increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement costs asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.

Unbilled Revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Louisiana’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2014 was $30.8 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $45.4 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $54.5 million to its pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $57 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2014 were $10.9 million. Entergy Louisiana expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs of approximately $12.8 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $11.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute approximately $9.9 million in 2015.

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $70.3 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $9.7 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $10.5 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $1.2 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income decreased $7.3 million primarily due to the write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, subsequently approved by the MPSC, in which Entergy Mississippi agreed not to pursue recovery of the costs deferred by an MPSC order in the new nuclear generation docket. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation. Also contributing to the decrease were higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher taxes other than income taxes. These decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income increased $35.4 million primarily due to higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses.

Net Revenue

2014 Compared to 2013

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase, as approved by the MPSC, effective September 2013 and an increase in the storm damage rider, as approved by the MPSC, effective October 2013. The increase in the storm damage rider is offset by other operation and maintenance expenses and has no effect on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan and storm damage rider.

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to an increase in reserve equalization revenue primarily due to the changes in the Entergy System generation mix as a result of Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the System Agreement in December 2013.

378
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis

The transmission equalization variance is primarily due to changes in transmission investment equalization billings under the Entergy System Agreement compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the System Agreement in December 2013.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 86 GWh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales as compared to the prior year and an increase in industrial. The increase in industrial usage is primarily in the primary metals and pipelines industries.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to the recovery of Hinds plant costs through the power management rider, as approved by the MPSC, effective with the first billing cycle of 2013 and a formula rate plan increase effective September 2013. The net income effect of the Hinds plant cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity on the net plant investment with the remainder offset by the Hinds plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes. The increase is partially offset by a temporary increase in 2012 in the storm cost recovery rider, as approved by the MPSC for a five-month period effective August 2012. This temporary increase in revenues in 2012 was offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and had no effect on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan increase.

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to increased reserve equalization revenue resulting from the acquisition of the Hinds plant in November 2012.

Other Income Statement Variances

2014 Compared to 2013

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

•a decrease of $11.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in September 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;

•a decrease of $7.6 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work done during plant outages in 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013;

•a decrease of $5.9 million resulting from costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the Utility’s transmission business;

379
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•a decrease of $5.1 million in implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits related to the human capital management strategic imperative in 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion; and

•a net decrease of $3.8 million related to Baxter Wilson (Unit 1) repairs. The increase in repair costs incurred in 2014 compared to the prior year were offset by expected insurance proceeds and the deferral of repair costs, as approved by the MPSC. See “Baxter Wilson Plant Event” below for further discussion.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•an increase of $10 million in storm damage accruals, as approved by the MPSC, effective October 2013;

•an increase of $5.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 in administration fees related to participation in the MISO RTO;

•an increase of $4 million in regulatory, consulting, and legal fees;

•an increase of $2.3 million in distribution and transmission vegetation maintenance;

•an increase of $1.3 million due to higher write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts in 2014 as compared to 2013; and

•several individually insignificant items.

The asset write-off resulted from the $56.2 million ($36.7 million after-tax) write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, subsequently approved by the MPSC, in which Entergy Mississippi agreed not to pursue recovery of the costs deferred by an MPSC order in the new nuclear generation docket. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation.

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes in 2014 as compared to prior year and an increase in local franchise taxes due to higher revenues.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.

2013 Compared to 2012

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•an increase of $30.6 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses resulting from a higher scope of work done during plant outages in 2013 as compared to 2012, the acquisition of the Hinds plant in November 2012, and the Baxter Wilson (Unit 1) unplanned outage in September 2013;

•an increase of $7.1 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion; and

•an increase of $5.9 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs and a settlement charge, recognized in September 2013, related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs.

The increase was partially offset by a temporary increase in 2012 of $17.8 million in storm damage accruals, as approved by the MPSC for a five-month period effective August 2012, and several individually insignificant items.

Also, other operation and maintenance expenses include $5.9 million in 2013 and $7.6 million in 2012 of costs incurred related to the now terminated plan to spin off and merge the transmission business.

380
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of a higher assessment in 2013 primarily due to the acquisition of the Hinds plant in November 2012.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service, including the acquisition of the Hinds plant in November 2012.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 42.7%, 37.7%, and 55.6%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

Baxter Wilson Plant Event 

On September 11, 2013, Entergy Mississippi’s Baxter Wilson (Unit 1) power plant experienced a significant unplanned outage event. Entergy Mississippi completed the repairs to the unit in December 2014. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Mississippi incurred $22.3 million of capital spending and $26.6 million of operation and maintenance expenses to return the unit to service. The damage was covered by Entergy Mississippi’s property insurance policy, subject to a $20 million deductible. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Mississippi recorded an insurance receivable of $28.2 million for the amount expected to be received from its insurance policy, allocating $12.9 million of the expected insurance proceeds to capital spending and $15.3 million to operation and maintenance expenses. In June 2014, Entergy Mississippi filed a rate case with the MPSC, which includes recovery of the costs associated with Baxter Wilson (Unit 1) repair activities, net of applicable insurance proceeds. In December 2014 the MPSC issued an order that provided for a deferral of $6 million in other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the Baxter Wilson outage and that the regulatory asset should accrue carrying costs, with amortization of the regulatory asset to occur over two years beginning in February 2015, and provided that the capital costs will be reflected in rate base. The final accounting of costs to return the unit to service and insurance proceeds will be addressed in Entergy Mississippi’s next formula rate plan filing.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

381
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $83.8 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•increased recovery of fuel costs;

•the timing of collections of receivables from customers; and

•System Agreement bandwidth remedy payments of $11.3 million received in the second quarter 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the FERC’s February 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period.

The increase was partially offset by:

•System Agreement bandwidth remedy payments made in September 2014 of $16.4 million as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the FERC’s orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the 2007 - 2009 period;

•an increase of $15 million in income tax payments in 2014. Entergy Mississippi had income tax payments in 2014 and 2013 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The 2013 and 2014 payments resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Mississippi had previously claimed a tax deduction; and

•an increase of $13.7 million in pension contributions in 2014 as compared to 2013. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the System Agreement proceedings.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $17.3 million in 2013 primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables from customers and a $1.5 million decrease in pension contributions in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase was partially offset by income tax payments of $4.7 million in 2013, as discussed above, as compared to income tax refunds of $0.7 million in 2012. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $28.4 million in 2014 primarily due to money pool activity and an increase in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work done during plant outages in 2014 and an increase in spending on Baxter Wilson (Unit 1) repairs in 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in transmission construction expenditures as a result of a decrease in reliability work performed in 2014.

Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool increased by $0.6 million in 2014 compared to decreasing by $16.9 million in 2013. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $241.7 million in 2013 primarily due to the payment for the purchase of Hinds Energy Facility in November 2012 of approximately $203 million, including adjustments to the purchase price, and money pool activity. See Note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of the purchase of Hinds Energy Facility.

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $16.9 million in 2013 compared to increasing by $16.9 million in 2012.

382
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis

Financing Activities

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $59.1 million in 2014 primarily due to the issuance of $100 million of 3.75% Series first mortgage bonds in March 2014 and the payment, at maturity, of $100 million of 5.15% Series first mortgage bonds in February 2013.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•the payment, prior to maturity, of $95 million of 4.95% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2014;

•an increase of $54 million in common stock dividends paid in 2014 as compared to 2013; and

•money pool activity.

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool decreased by $3.5 million in 2014 compared to increasing by $3.5 million in 2013.

Entergy Mississippi’s financing activities used $123.2 million of cash in 2013 as compared to providing $241.7 million of cash in 2012 primarily due to the payment, at maturity, of $100 million of 5.15% Series first mortgage bonds in February 2013 and the issuance of $250 million of 3.1% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2012.

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.

Capital Structure

Entergy Mississippi’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Mississippi’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for:

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•dividend and interest payments.

Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and other capital investments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s existing debt obligations and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements. 

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $22.5 million to its pension plans and approximately $535 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2015, although the 2015 required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. See “Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi has $13.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi includes amounts associated with specific investments such as environmental compliance spending; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; resource planning; generation projects; system improvements; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Mississippi’s long-term debt indenture restricts the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of 

384
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis

December 31, 2014, Entergy Mississippi had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $68.5 million.

New Nuclear Generation Development Costs

Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi had been developing and preserving a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. In October 2010, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC requesting that the MPSC determine that it was in the public interest to preserve the option to construct new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and that the MPSC approve the deferral of Entergy Mississippi’s costs incurred to date and in the future related to this project, including the accrual of AFUDC or similar carrying charges. In October 2011, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed with the MPSC a joint stipulation that the MPSC approved in November 2011. The stipulation stated that there should be a deferral of the $57 million of costs incurred through September 2011 in connection with planning, evaluating, monitoring, and other related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf. 

In October 2014, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into and filed joint stipulations in Entergy Mississippi’s general rate case proceeding, which are discussed below. In consideration of the comprehensive terms for settlement in that rate case proceeding, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi agreed that Entergy Mississippi would request consolidation of the new nuclear generation development costs proceeding with the rate case proceeding for hearing purposes and will not further pursue, except as noted below, recovery of the costs deferred by MPSC order in the new nuclear generation development docket. The stipulations state, however, that, if Entergy Mississippi decides to move forward with nuclear development in Mississippi, it can at that time re-present for consideration by the MPSC only those costs directly associated with the existing early site permit (ESP), to the extent that the costs are verifiable and prudent and the ESP is still valid and relevant to any such option pursued. After considering the progress of the new nuclear generation costs proceeding in light of the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi recorded in 2014 a $56.2 million pre-tax charge to recognize that the regulatory asset associated with new nuclear generation development is no longer probable of recovery. In December 2014 the MPSC issued an order accepting in their entirety the October 2014 stipulations, including the findings and terms of the stipulations regarding new nuclear generation development costs. 

Sources of Capital

Entergy Mississippi’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt or preferred stock issuances; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Mississippi may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indenture, and other agreements. Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Mississippi’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Mississippi has four separate credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $102.5 million scheduled to expire May 2015. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2014. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities. In addition, Entergy Mississippi entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility in 2013 and an uncommitted letter of credit facility in 2014 as a means to post collateral to support its obligations under MISO. As of December 31, 2014, a $14.4 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Mississippi’s letter of credit facility which was issued in 2014.

Entergy Mississippi obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2015 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $175 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and security issuances. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Mississippi has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through October 2015.

In March 2014, Entergy Mississippi issued $100 million of 3.75% Series first mortgage bonds due July 2024. Entergy Mississippi used the proceeds to pay, prior to maturity, its $95 million of 4.95% Series first mortgage bonds due June 2018 and for general corporate purposes.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Mississippi is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Formula Rate Plan

In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider. In March 2010 the MPSC issued an order: (1) providing the opportunity for a reset of Entergy Mississippi’s return on common equity to a point within the formula rate plan bandwidth and eliminating the 50/50 sharing that had been in the plan, (2) modifying the performance measurement process, and (3) replacing the revenue change limit of two percent of revenues, which was subject to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap, with a limit of four percent of revenues, although any adjustment above two percent requires a hearing before the MPSC. The MPSC did not approve Entergy Mississippi’s request to use a projected test year for its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing and, therefore, Entergy Mississippi continued to use a historical test year for its annual evaluation reports under the plan. 

In March 2012, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan filing for the 2011 test year. The filing shows an earned return on common equity of 10.92% for the test year, which is within the earnings bandwidth and results in no change in rates. In February 2013 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provided for no change in rates.

In March 2013, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan filing for the 2012 test year. The filing requested a $36.3 million revenue increase to reset Entergy Mississippi’s return on common equity to 10.55%, which is a point within the formula rate plan bandwidth. In June 2013, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation, in which both parties agreed that the MPSC should approve a $22.3 million rate

increase for Entergy Mississippi which, with other adjustments reflected in the stipulation, would have the effect of resetting Entergy Mississippi’s return on common equity to 10.59% when adjusted for performance under the formula rate plan. In August 2013 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff authorizing the rate increase effective with September 2013 bills. Additionally, the MPSC authorized Entergy Mississippi to defer approximately $1.2 million in MISO-related implementation costs incurred in 2012 along with other MISO-related implementation costs incurred in 2013.

In June 2014, Entergy Mississippi filed its first general rate case before the MPSC in almost 12 years. The rate filing laid out Entergy Mississippi’s plans for improving reliability, modernizing the grid, maintaining its workforce, stabilizing rates, utilizing new technologies, and attracting new industry to its service territory. Entergy Mississippi requested a net increase in revenue of $49 million for bills rendered during calendar year 2015, including $30 million resulting from new depreciation rates to update the estimated service life of assets. In addition, the filing proposed, among other things: 1) realigning cost recovery of the Attala and Hinds power plant acquisitions from the power management rider to base rates; 2) including certain MISO-related revenues and expenses in the power management rider; 3) power management rider changes that reflect the changes in costs and revenues that will accompany Entergy Mississippi’s withdrawal from participation in the System Agreement; and 4) a formula rate plan forward test year to allow for known changes in expenses and revenues for the rate effective period. Entergy Mississippi proposed maintaining the current authorized return on common equity of 10.59%. 

In October 2014, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into and filed joint stipulations that addressed the majority of issues in the proceeding. The stipulations provided for:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•revision of Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan by providing Entergy Mississippi with the ability to reflect known and measurable changes to historical rate base and certain expense amounts; resolving uncertainty around and obviating the need for an additional rate filing in connection with Entergy Mississippi’s withdrawal from participation in the System Agreement; updating depreciation rates; and moving costs associated with the Attala and Hinds generating plants from the power management rider to base rates;

•recovery of non-fuel MISO-related costs through a separate rider for that purpose;

•a deferral of $6 million in other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the Baxter Wilson outage and a determination that the regulatory asset should accrue carrying costs, with amortization of the regulatory asset over two years beginning in February 2015, and a provision that the capital costs will be reflected in rate base. See "Baxter Wilson Plant Event" above for further discussion of the Baxter Wilson outage; and

•consolidation of the new nuclear generation development costs proceeding with the general rate case proceeding for hearing purposes and a determination that Entergy Mississippi would not further pursue, except as noted below, recovery of the costs that were approved for deferral by the MPSC in November 2011. The stipulations state, however, that, if Entergy Mississippi decides to move forward with nuclear development in Mississippi, it can at that time re-present for consideration by the MPSC only those costs directly associated with the existing early site permit (ESP), to the extent that the costs are verifiable and prudent and the ESP is still valid and relevant to any such option pursued. See "New Nuclear Generation Development Costs" above for further discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs proceeding and subsequent write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset related to those costs. 

In December 2014 the MPSC issued an order accepting the stipulations in their entirety and approving the revenue adjustments and rate changes effective with February 2015 bills. 

In August 2012 the MPSC opened inquiries to review whether the current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan and Mississippi Power Company’s annual formula rate plan is still appropriate or can be improved to better serve the public interest. The intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan docket. In March

Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

2013 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed its consultant’s report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. The report suggested ways in which the methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time. In June 2014 the MPSC expanded the scope of the August 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans. The MPSC directed the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to investigate and review Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan rider schedule and Mississippi Power Company’s Performance Evaluation Plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies. No procedural schedule has been set. In October 2014 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities’ formula rate plans.

In Entergy Mississippi’s 2014 general rate case, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a review of Entergy Mississippi’s proposed changes to its formula rate plan and recommended changes in that proceeding that may be duplicative of the review being conducted simultaneously in the above-described formula rate plan docket. Consequently, the MPSC found in the general rate case order that the changes to Entergy Mississippi's formula rate plan schedule approved in that order are just and reasonable and should remain unchanged by any MPSC action in the above-described formula rate plan docket, but that any provisions of Entergy Mississippi's formula rate plan schedule not specifically addressed in the general rate case order may be reviewed and changed.

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that, effective January 1, 2013, is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

Entergy Mississippi had a deferred fuel balance of $60.4 million as of March 31, 2014. In May 2014, Entergy Mississippi filed for an interim adjustment under its energy cost recovery rider. The interim adjustment proposed a net energy cost factor designed to collect over a six-month period the under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of March 31, 2014 and also reflected a natural gas price of $4.50 per MMBtu. In May 2014, Entergy Mississippi and the Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation in which Entergy Mississippi agreed to a revised net energy cost factor that reflected the proposed interim adjustment with a reduction in costs recovered through the energy cost recovery rider associated with the suspension of the DOE nuclear waste storage fee. In June 2014 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation and allowed Entergy Mississippi’s interim adjustment. In November 2014, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. Due to lower gas prices and a lower deferred fuel balance, the redetermined annual factor was a decrease from the revised interim net energy cost factor. In January 2015 the MPSC approved the redetermined annual factor effective January 30, 2015.

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint

The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The complaint is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. In December 2008 the defendant Entergy companies removed the attorney general’s lawsuit to U.S. District Court in Jackson, Mississippi. The Mississippi attorney general moved to remand the matter to state court. In August 2012 the District Court issued an opinion denying the Attorney General’s motion for remand, finding that the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act.

388
Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis

The defendant Entergy companies answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. In May 2009 the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint. In September 2012 the District Court heard oral argument on Entergy’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The District Court’s ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings is pending.

In January 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in which it held that cases brought by attorneys general as the sole plaintiff to enforce state laws were not subject to the federal law that allowed federal courts to hear those cases as “mass action” lawsuits. One day later the Attorney General renewed its motion to remand the Entergy case back to state court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision. The defendant Entergy companies have responded to that motion and the District Court held oral argument on the motion to remand in February 2014. Entergy also has asserted federal question jurisdiction as a basis for the district court having jurisdiction and also has pending the motion for judgment on the pleadings.

Storm Damage Accrual and Storm Cost Recovery

In two orders issued in July 2012 the MPSC temporarily increased Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision monthly accrual from $0.75 million to $2 million for bills rendered during the billing months of August 2012 through December 2012, and approved recovery of $14.9 million in prudently incurred storm costs to be amortized over five months, beginning with August 2012 bills.

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused damage to Entergy Mississippi’s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Mississippi’s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Isaac were $22 million. 

On July 1, 2013, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation, wherein both parties agreed that approximately $32 million in storm restoration costs incurred in 2011 and 2012 were prudently incurred and chargeable to the storm damage provision, while approximately $700,000 in prudently incurred costs were more properly recoverable through the formula rate plan. Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff also agreed that the storm damage accrual should be increased from $750,000 per month to $1.75 million per month. In September 2013 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with the increase in the storm damage accrual effective with October 2013 bills. In February 2015, Entergy Mississippi provided notice to the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that the storm damage accrual would be set to zero effective with the March 2015 billing cycle as a result of Entergy Mississippi's storm damage accrual balance exceeding $15 million as of January 31, 2015, but will return to its current level when the storm damage accrual balance becomes less than $10 million.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Environmental Risks

Entergy Mississippi’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Mississippi is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial position or results of operations.

Unbilled Revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Mississippi’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2014 was $10 million. Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $16.4 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $21.8 million to its qualified pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $22.5 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Mississippi in 2014 was $982 thousand. Entergy Mississippi expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $758 thousand. Entergy Mississippi contributed $8.5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute $535 thousand in 2015.

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $33.5 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $4.6 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $4.8 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.6 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

Algiers Asset Transfer

In October 2014, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake a transaction that would result in the transfer from Entergy Louisiana to Entergy New Orleans of certain assets that currently support the provision of service to Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers. The transaction is expected to result in the transfer of net assets of approximately $60 million. The Algiers asset transfer is also subject to regulatory review and approval of the FERC. Entergy Louisiana also filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake the Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana business combination. The application provides that if the City Council approves the Algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the City Council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the business combination. If the necessary approvals are obtained from the City Council and the FERC, Entergy Louisiana expects to transfer the Algiers assets to Entergy New Orleans in the second half of 2015. In November 2014 the City Council approved a resolution establishing a procedural schedule that provides for a hearing on the joint application in late-May 2015, with a decision to be rendered no later than June 2015.

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income increased $17 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income decreased $5.4 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate.

Net Revenue

2014 Compared to 2013 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

400
Entergy New Orleans, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 125 GWh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, including the effect of favorable weather on residential sales in 2014 as compared to the prior year and a 2% increase in the average number of electric customers.

The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to the effect of favorable weather, primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, in 2014 as compared to the prior year.

The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to changes as a result of participation in the MISO RTO in 2014.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 125 GWh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors primarily due to the effects of Hurricane Isaac, which decreased sales volume in 2012, and in part to a 2% increase in the average number of both residential and commercial customers.

The rider revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in franchise tax rider revenue as a result of higher retail revenues. There is a corresponding increase in taxes other than income taxes, resulting in no effect on net income.

The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather, primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, in 2013 as compared to prior year.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan decrease effective September 2013. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan filing.

Other Income Statement Variances

2014 Compared to 2013

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

•a decrease of $7.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in September 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; 

401
Entergy New Orleans, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•a decrease of $6.7 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall lower scope of work done during plant outages as compared to prior year; and

•a decrease of $2.4 million in outside regulatory consultant fees.

2013 Compared to 2012

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•an increase of $9 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall higher scope of work done during plant outages as compared to prior year; 

•an increase of $4.4 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion; and

•an increase of $3.1 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs and a settlement charge recognized in September 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3 million in loss reserves and a decrease of $1.5 million due to expenses recorded in 2012 related to the Energy Smart Program.

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher electric and gas retail revenues as compared to prior year and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. Franchise taxes have no effect on net income as these taxes are recovered through the franchise tax rider.

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $100 million of 3.90% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2013 and the issuance of $30 million of 5.00% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2012, partially offset by the retirement, at maturity, of $70 million of 5.25% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 30%, 12.2%, and 29.8%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $5.3 million in 2014 primarily due to the payment of calendar year 2012 System Agreement bandwidth remedy payments of $15 million to the City of New Orleans in June 2014 for use in the streetlight conversion program, as directed by the City Council, an increase of $6.3 million in pension contributions, and income tax payments of $4.9 million in 2014 compared to income tax refunds of $1.4 million in 2013. The decrease in cash flow was offset by the timing of collections from customers. See “Critical Accountings Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $34.2 million in 2013 primarily due to the increased recovery of fuel costs and decreased Hurricane Isaac storm spending in 2013, partially offset by a decrease of $11.5 million in income tax refunds. The income tax refunds of $13 million in 2012 resulted primarily from a decrease of previously estimated 2011 taxable income due to the recognition of additional bonus depreciation. 

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $25.2 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•a decrease in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to spending on the Michoud turbine blade replacement projects in 2013;

•a decrease in transmission construction expenditures as a result of decreased scope of work in 2014; and

•money pool activity.

The decrease was partially offset by receipts from the storm reserve escrow account of $7.8 million in 2013.

Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased $4.3 million in 2014 compared to increasing $1.8 million in 2013. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

403
Entergy New Orleans, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $11.6 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•money pool activity;

•an increase in transmission construction expenditures as a result of additional reliability work performed in 2013; and

•an increase in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures as a result of increased scope of work in 2013.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in distribution construction expenditures due to higher spending related to Hurricane Isaac in 2012.

Increases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool increased $1.8 million in 2013 compared to decreasing $6.2 million in 2012. 

Financing Activities

Entergy New Orleans’s financing activities used $7.7 million of cash in 2014 compared to providing $27.4 million of cash in 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $100 million of 3.9% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2013 and $6 million in common stock dividends paid in 2014, partially offset by the retirement of $70 million of 5.25% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013. 

Net cash provided by financing activities increased $1.9 million in 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $100 million of 3.90% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2013 compared to the issuance of $30 million of 5.0% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2012. The increase was substantially offset by the retirement of $70 million of 5.25% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2013. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for more details on long-term debt.

Capital Structure

Entergy New Orleans’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt as shown in the following table. The decrease in debt to capital ratio is due to an increase in retained earnings.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy New Orleans uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition. Entergy New Orleans uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluation Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy New Orleans’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents.

(b)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy New Orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy New Orleans currently expects to contribute approximately $10.9 million to its pension plan in 2015, and approximately $3.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2015, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans has $33 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans includes specific investments such as environmental compliance spending; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; resource planning; generation projects; system improvements; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance,

Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 is a nominally-sized 560 MW unit that is expected to cost approximately $655 million to construct when spending is complete, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 25% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. In March 2012 the LPSC 

406
Entergy New Orleans, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

unanimously voted to grant the certifications requested by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. Following approval by the LPSC, Entergy Louisiana issued full notice to proceed to the project’s engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. Under terms approved by the City Council, non-fuel costs associated with Ninemile 6 may be recovered through a special rider for that purpose. The unit was placed in service in December 2014.

State and Local Rate Regulation

The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Rate Cases and Formula Rate Plans 

In April 2009 the City Council approved a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy New Orleans, with terms including an 11.1% benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/-40 basis point bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/-50 basis point bandwidth. Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy New Orleans was over- or under-earning. The formula rate plan also included a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions, plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure events.

In May 2012, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports for the 2011 test year. Subsequent adjustments agreed upon with the City Council Advisors indicate a $4.9 million electric base revenue increase and a $0.05 million gas base revenue increase as necessary under the formula rate plan. As part of the original filing, Entergy New Orleans also requested to increase annual funding for its storm reserve by approximately $5.7 million for five years. On September 26, 2012, Entergy New Orleans made a filing with the City Council that implemented the $4.9 million electric formula rate plan rate increase and the $0.05 million gas formula rate plan rate increase. The new rates were effective with the first billing cycle in October 2012. In August 2013 the City Council unanimously approved a settlement of all issues in the formula rate plan proceeding. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, Entergy New Orleans implemented an approximately $1.625 million net decrease to the electric rates that were in effect prior to the electric rate increase implemented in October 2012, with no change in gas rates. Entergy New Orleans refunded to customers approximately $6 million over the four-month period from September 2013 through December 2013 to make the electric rate decrease effective as of the first billing cycle of October 2012. Entergy New Orleans had previously recorded provisions for the majority of the refund to customers, but recorded an additional $1.1 million provision in second quarter 2013 as a result of the settlement. Entergy New Orleans’s formula rate plan ended with the 2011 test year and has not been extended. Entergy New Orleans is recovering the costs of its power purchase agreement with Entergy Louisiana for 20% of the capacity and energy of the Ninemile Unit 6 generating station, which commenced operation in December 2014, through a special Ninemile Unit 6 rider.

A 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. In September 2009 the City Council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans. The rate settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. In October 2013 the City Council approved the extension of the current Energy Smart program through December 2014. The City Council approved the use of $3.5 million of rough production cost equalization funds for program costs. In addition, Entergy New Orleans will be allowed to recover its lost contribution to fixed costs and to earn an incentive for meeting program goals. In January 2015 the City Council approved extending the Energy Smart program through March 2015 and using $1.2 million of rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs for the extended period. Additionally, the City Council approved funding for the Energy Smart 2 programs from April 2015 through March 2017 using the

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

remainder of the approximately $12.4 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, and with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause.

Storm Cost Recovery 

In October 2006, the City Council approved a rate filing settlement agreement that, among other things, authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider that began in March 2007. These storm reserve funds are held in a restricted escrow account until needed in response to a storm. 

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused extensive damage to Entergy New Orleans’s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Isaac were $47.3 million. Entergy New Orleans withdrew $17.4 million from the storm reserve escrow account to partially offset these costs. In February 2014, Entergy New Orleans made a filing with the City Council seeking certification of the Hurricane Isaac costs. In January 2015 the City Council issued a resolution approving the terms of a joint agreement in principle filed by Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Louisiana, and the City Council Advisors determining, among other things, that Entergy New Orleans’s prudently-incurred storm recovery costs were $49.3 million, of which $31.7 million, net of reimbursements from the storm reserve escrow account, remains recoverable from Entergy New Orleans’s electric customers. The resolution also directs Entergy New Orleans to file an application to securitize the unrecovered Council-approved storm recovery costs of $31.7 million pursuant to the Louisiana Electric Utility Storm Recovery Securitization Act (Louisiana Act 64). In addition, the resolution found that it is reasonable for Entergy New Orleans to include in the principal amount of its potential securitization the costs to fund and replenish Entergy New Orleans’s storm reserve in an amount that achieves the Council-approved funding level of $75 million. In January 2015, in compliance with that directive, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council an application requesting that the City Council grant a financing order authorizing the financing of Entergy New Orleans’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 64.

Environmental Risks

Entergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial position or results of operations.

Unbilled Revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy New Orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy New Orleans’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Cost Sensitivity

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2014 was $6.6 million. Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $9 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $10.5 million to its pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $10.9 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy New Orleans in 2014 was $1.5 million. Entergy New Orleans expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $1.6 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $4.3 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute $3.7 million in 2015.

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $15 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.6 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.2 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income increased $16.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income increased $15.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

Net Revenue

2014 Compared to 2013

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to a decrease in expenses due to contract changes.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an annual base rate increase of $18.5 million, effective April 2014, as a result of the PUCT’s order in the September 2013 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 884 GWh, or 5%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales and increased industrial usage primarily in the petroleum industry as a result of expansions.

418
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to changes as a result of the participation in the MISO RTO in 2014.

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to an increase in reserve equalization expense as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to the changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of the Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the System Agreement in December 2013.

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to a wholesale customer contract termination in December 2013.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 470 GWh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather compared to last year on residential sales and increased usage in the industrial sector compared to prior year as a result of an unplanned outage in the refining industry in 2012.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an annual base rate increase of $28 million, effective July 2012, as a result of the PUCT’s order in the November 2011 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order.

The fuel recovery variance is primarily the result of a $6 million adjustment to deferred fuel costs recorded in third quarter 2012 in accordance with a rate order from the PUCT issued in September 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT order issued in Entergy Texas’s 2011 rate case.

The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset adjustment of $6.4 million was recorded in third quarter 2012 in accordance with the rate order from the PUCT issued in September 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order.

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to contract changes for municipals and co-op customers.

The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to additional capacity purchases as well as price increases for ongoing purchased power capacity.

419
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Other Income Statement Variances

2014 Compared to 2013

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•a decrease of $7.4 million resulting from costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the Utility’s transmission business; and

•a decrease of $7.1 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $5.9 million primarily due to administration fees in 2014 related to participation in the MISO RTO.

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to a reduction in the provision recorded for sales and use taxes in 2013, an increase in local franchise taxes, and an increase in ad valorem taxes. Franchise taxes have no effect on net income as these taxes are recovered through the franchise tax rider. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.

2013 Compared to 2012

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•an increase of $8.8 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative. See the “Human Capital Management Strategic Imperative” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion;

•an increase of $2.3 million primarily due to storm damage accruals in accordance with a rate order from PUCT issued in September 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order;

•an increase of $1.7 million in distribution contract work relating primarily to vegetation maintenance; and

•an increase of $1.4 million in insurance expenses primarily due to increases in premiums.

The increase was partially offset by:

•the amortization of $4.3 million of Hurricane Rita storm costs in prior year in accordance with a rate order from the PUCT issued in September 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order; and

•a decrease of $2.7 million in fossil-fueled expenses due to a reduced scope of work and fewer outages compared to 2012.

420
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Also, other operation and maintenance expenses include $7.4 million in 2013 and $4.8 million in 2012 of costs incurred related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the transmission business. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to a reduction in the provision recorded for sales and use taxes in 2012. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates as a result of the 2011 rate case order issued by the PUCT in September 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order.

Other income increased primarily due to the reversal in 2012 of $6.7 million of disallowed carrying charges on Hurricane Rita storm restoration costs in accordance with a rate order from the PUCT issued in September 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the PUCT rate order.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 39.9%, 34.2%, and 44.1% for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $78.1 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•$86.1 million of fuel cost refunds in 2013;

•System Agreement bandwidth remedy payments of $48.6 million received in the second quarter 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the FERC’s February 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period. Entergy Texas received approval to apply a portion of the payments to the under-collected fuel balance. The remaining balance of $24.6 million was refunded to Entergy Texas customers as of December 31, 2014; and

•the timing of collections from customers.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel cost refunds and the System Agreement proceedings.

421
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The increase was partially offset by:

•a decrease of $54.8 million in income tax refunds in 2014 compared to 2013. Entergy Texas had income tax refunds in 2013 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds in 2013 resulted from the utilization of Entergy Texas’s taxable losses against taxable income of other members of the Entergy consolidated group; and

•an increase of $10.2 million in pension contributions in 2014. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $34 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•the receipt, in January 2012, of $43 million in System Agreement bandwidth remedy payments required to implement the FERC’s remedy in an October 2011 order for the period June-December 2005. As of March 31, 2013, all of the $43 million, plus interest, had been credited to Entergy Texas customers, with the final $9.5 million being credited in the first quarter 2013. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the System Agreement proceedings;

•$86.1 million of fuel cost refunds in 2013, compared to $67.2 million of fuel cost refunds in 2012. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the fuel cost refunds; and

•the timing of collections of receivables from customers.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $55.3 million in income tax refunds. Entergy Texas had income tax refunds in 2013 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds resulted from the utilization of Entergy Texas’s taxable losses against taxable income of other members of the Entergy consolidated group.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased $22.2 million in 2014 primarily due to an increase in transmission construction expenditures and an increase in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures due to a greater scope of projects in 2014 and money pool activity.

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $6 million in 2014 compared to decreasing by $12.9 million in 2013. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $35.4 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•money pool activity;

•an increase in transmission construction expenditures due to reliability work performed in 2013; and 

•an increase in distribution construction expenditures due to an increased scope of work in 2013.

The increase was partially offset by lower fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures due to a greater scope of projects in 2012.

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $12.9 million in 2013 compared to decreasing by $44 million in 2012. 

Financing Activities

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $58.2 million in 2014 primarily due to the retirement of $150 million of 7.875% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2014 and an increase of $45 million in common stock 

422
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

dividends paid, partially offset by the issuance of $135 million of 5.625% Series first mortgage bonds in May 2014. See Note 5 to the financial statements for more details on long-term debt.

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $60.7 million in 2013 primarily due to a decrease of $62.2 million in common stock dividends paid.

Capital Structure

Entergy Texas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy Texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Texas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Texas requires capital resources for:

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•dividend and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s planned construction and other capital investments.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)Does not include power purchase agreements that are accounted for as leases that are included in purchase obligations.

(c)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $17.2 million to its pension plans and approximately $3.2 million to other postretirement plans in 2015, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Texas has $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Texas amounts associated with specific investments, such as the Union Power Station acquisition discussed below; NRC post-Fukushima requirements; environmental compliance spending; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; resource planning; generation projects; system improvements; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt in Note 5 to the financial statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Texas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.

Union Power Station Purchase Agreement

In December 2014, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Texas entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, a 1,980 MW (summer rating) power generation facility located near El Dorado, Arkansas, from Union Power Partners, L.P. The Union Power Station consists of four natural gas fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating). Pursuant to the agreement, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will acquire two of the power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility, and Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas will each acquire one power block and a 25% undivided ownership interest in such related assets. (If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Texas do not obtain approval for the purchase of their power blocks, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will seek to purchase the power blocks not approved.) The base purchase price is expected to be approximately $948 million (approximately $237 million for each power block) subject to adjustments. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates selling 20% of the capacity and energy associated with its two power blocks to Entergy New Orleans through a cost-based, life-of-unit power purchase

agreement. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC, LPSC, PUCT, and FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In December 2014, Entergy Texas filed its application with the PUCT for approval of the acquisition. The PUCT has indicated that it will convene the hearing on the merits of this case in June 2015. Entergy Texas intends to file a rate application to seek cost recovery later in 2015. In January 2015, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed its application with the LPSC and Entergy Arkansas filed its application with the APSC, each for approval of the acquisition and cost recovery. Closing is targeted to occur in late-2015.

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt or preferred stock issuances; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Texas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements. Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Texas’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $150 million scheduled to expire in March 2019. The credit facility allows Entergy Texas to issue letters of credit against 50% of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings and $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility. In addition, Entergy Texas entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility in 2014 as a means to post collateral to support its obligations under MISO. As of December 31, 2014, a $24.5 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Texas’s letter of credit facility.

Entergy Texas obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2015 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and security issuances. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s short-term borrowing limits.

In May 2014, Entergy Texas issued $135 million of 5.625% Series first mortgage bonds due June 2064. Entergy Texas used the proceeds to pay, prior to maturity, a portion of its $150 million of 7.875% Series first mortgage bonds due June 2039.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Filings with the PUCT

2011 Rate Case

In November 2011, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $112 million base rate increase reflecting a 10.6% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2011 test year. The rate case also proposed a purchased power recovery rider. On January 12, 2012, the PUCT voted not to address the purchased power recovery rider in the current rate case, but the PUCT voted to set a baseline in the rate case proceeding that would be applicable if a purchased power capacity rider is approved in a separate proceeding. In April 2012 the PUCT Staff filed direct testimony recommending a base rate increase of $66 million and a 9.6% return on common equity. The PUCT Staff, however, subsequently filed a statement of position in the proceeding indicating that it was still evaluating the position it would ultimately take in the case regarding Entergy Texas’s recovery of purchased power capacity costs and Entergy Texas’s proposal to defer its MISO transition expenses. In April 2012, Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony indicating a revised request for a $105 million base rate increase. A hearing was held in late-April through early-May 2012. 

In September 2012 the PUCT issued an order approving a $28 million rate increase, effective July 2012. The order includes a finding that “a return on common equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent will allow [Entergy Texas] a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on invested capital.” The order also provides for increases in depreciation rates and the annual storm reserve accrual. The order also reduced Entergy Texas’s proposed purchased power capacity costs, stating that they are not known and measureable; reduced Entergy Texas’s regulatory assets associated with Hurricane Rita; excluded from rate recovery capitalized financially-based incentive compensation; included $1.6 million of MISO transition expense in base rates, and reduced Entergy’s Texas’s fuel reconciliation recovery by $4 million because it disagreed with the line-loss factor used in the calculation. After considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the PUCT order, Entergy Texas recorded in the third quarter 2012 an approximate $24 million charge to recognize that assets associated with Hurricane Rita, financially-based incentive compensation, and fuel recovery are no longer probable of recovery. Entergy Texas continues to believe that it is entitled to recover these prudently incurred costs, however, and it filed a motion for rehearing regarding these and several other issues in the PUCT’s order on October 4, 2012. Several other parties have also filed motions for rehearing of the PUCT’s order. The PUCT subsequently denied rehearing of substantive issues. Several parties, including Entergy Texas, have appealed the PUCT’s order to the Travis County District Court. A hearing was held in July 2014. In October 2014 the Travis County District Court issued an order upholding the PUCT’s decision except as to the line-loss factor issue referenced above, which was found in favor of Entergy Texas. In November 2014, Entergy Texas appealed the Travis County District Court decision and the PUCT appealed the decision on the line-loss factor issue. Entergy Texas expects to file briefs during the first half of 2015. 

2013 Rate Case

In September 2013, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $38.6 million base rate increase reflecting a 10.4% return on common equity based on an adjusted test year ending March 31, 2013. The rate case also proposed (1) a rough production cost equalization adjustment rider recovering Entergy Texas’s payment to Entergy New Orleans to achieve rough production cost equalization based on calendar year 2012 production costs and (2) a rate case expense rider recovering the cost of the 2013 rate case and certain costs associated with previous rate cases. The rate case filing also included a request to reconcile $0.9 billion of fuel and purchased power costs and fuel revenues covering the period July 2011 through March 2013. The fuel reconciliation also reflects special circumstances fuel cost recovery of approximately $22 million of purchased power capacity costs. In January 2014 the PUCT staff filed direct testimony recommending a retail rate reduction of $0.3 million and a 9.2% return on common equity. In March 2014, Entergy Texas filed an Agreed Motion for Interim Rates. The motion explained that the parties to this proceeding have agreed 

426
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

that Entergy Texas should be allowed to implement new rates reflecting an $18.5 million base rate increase, effective for usage on and after April 1, 2014, as well as recovery of charges for rough production cost equalization and rate case expenses. In March 2014 the State Office of Administrative Hearings, the body assigned to hear the case, approved the motion. In April 2014, Entergy Texas filed a unanimous stipulation in this case. Among other things, the stipulation provides for an $18.5 million base rate increase, recovery over three years of the calendar year 2012 rough production cost equalization charges and rate case expenses, and states a 9.8% return on common equity. In addition, the stipulation finalizes the fuel and purchased power reconciliation covering the period July 2011 through March 2013, with the parties stipulating an immaterial fuel disallowance. No special circumstances recovery of purchased power capacity costs was allowed. In April 2014 the State Office of Administrative Hearings remanded the case back to the PUCT for final processing. In May 2014 the PUCT approved the stipulation. No motions for rehearing were filed during the statutory rehearing period. 

In September 2014, Entergy Texas filed for a distribution cost recovery factor rider based on a law that was passed in 2011 allowing for the recovery of increases in capital costs associated with distribution plant. Entergy Texas requested collection of approximately $7 million annually from retail customers. The parties reached a unanimous settlement authorizing recovery of $3.6 million annually commencing with usage on and after January 1, 2015. A State Office of Administrative Hearings ALJ issued an order in December 2014 authorizing this recovery on an interim basis and remanded the case to the PUCT. In February 2015 the PUCT entered a final order, making the settlement final and the interim rates permanent.

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. 

In December 2011, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $43 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties to the proceeding reached an agreement that Entergy Texas would refund $67 million, including interest and additional over-recoveries through December 2011, over a three-month period. Entergy Texas and the parties requested that interim rates consistent with the settlement be approved effective with the March 2012 billing month, and the PUCT approved the application in March 2012. Entergy Texas completed this refund to customers in May 2012.

In October 2012, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $78 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2012. Entergy Texas requested that the refund be implemented over a six-month period effective with the January 2013 billing month. Entergy Texas and the parties to the proceeding reached an agreement that Entergy Texas would refund $84 million, including interest and additional over-recoveries through October 2012, to most customers over a three-month period beginning January 2013. The PUCT approved the stipulation in January 2013. Entergy Texas completed this refund to customers in March 2013.

In July 2012, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT an application to credit its customers approximately $37.5 million, including interest, resulting from the FERC’s October 2011 order in the System Agreement rough production cost equalization proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the FERC’s October 2011 order. In September 2012 the parties submitted a stipulation resolving the proceeding. The stipulation provided that most Entergy Texas customers would be credited over a four-month period beginning October 2012. The credits were initiated with the October 2012 billing month on an interim basis, and the PUCT subsequently approved the stipulation, also in October 2012.

In August 2014, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to implement an interim fuel refund of approximately $24.6 million for over-collected fuel costs incurred during the months of November 2012 through April 2014. This refund resulted from (i) applying $48.6 million in bandwidth remedy payments that Entergy Texas 

427
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

received in May 2014 related to the June - December 2005 period to Entergy Texas’s $8.7 million under-recovered fuel balance as of April 30, 2014 and (ii) netting that fuel balance against the $15.3 million bandwidth remedy payment that Entergy Texas made related to calendar year 2013 production costs. Also in August 2014, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed motion for interim rates to implement these refunds for most customers over a two-month period commencing with September 2014. The PUCT issued its order approving the interim relief in August 2014 and Entergy Texas completed the refunds in October 2014. Parties intervened in this matter. All parties agreed that this case should be bifurcated such that the interim refunds would become final in a separate docket. The current docket would remain in place to potentially address additional rough production cost equalization-related matters that are not part of the interim refunds discussed above. In January 2015, Entergy Texas filed a request for this severance and final approval of the interim refund. Both applications are pending.

At the PUCT’s April 2013 open meeting, the PUCT Commissioners discussed their view that a purchased power capacity rider was good public policy. The PUCT issued an order in May 2013 adopting the rule allowing for a purchased power capacity rider, subject to an offsetting adjustment for load growth. The rule, as adopted, also includes a process for obtaining pre-approval by the PUCT of purchased power agreements. Entergy Texas has not exercised the option to recover its capacity costs under the new rider mechanism, but will continue to evaluate the benefits of utilizing the new rider to recover future capacity costs. 

Federal Regulation

See “Entergy’s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization,” “System Agreement,” and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics.

Nuclear Matters

See the “Nuclear Matters” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters.

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base. Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Texas does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Texas’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.

Environmental Risks

Entergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that 

428
Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas’s financial position or results of operations.

Unbilled Revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Texas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Texas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2014 was $8.5 million. Entergy Texas anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $12.1 million. Entergy Texas contributed $17.1 million to its qualified pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $17.2 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Texas in 2014 was $2.8 million. Entergy Texas expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $3.0 million. Entergy Texas contributed $3.4 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute approximately $3.2 million in 2015. 

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $30.8 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $8.2 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $4.3 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $1 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

System Energy’s principal asset currently consists of an ownership interest and a leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenues.

Results of Operations

Net Income

2014 Compared to 2013

Net income decreased $17.3 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate and lower operating revenues resulting from lower rate base as compared with the same period in the prior year, partially offset by higher other regulatory credits. System Energy records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. The increase in regulatory credits for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily caused by increases in depreciation and accretion expenses and regulatory credits recorded in 2014 to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net income increased $1.8 million primarily due to higher operating income and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower other income. Operating income was higher because of higher rate base compared to 2012 resulting from capital spending at Grand Gulf, including the uprate project. The lower effective income tax rate was primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the provision for uncertain tax positions. Other income was lower due to AFUDC accrued on the Grand Gulf uprate project in 2012. Grand Gulf’s Spring 2012 refueling outage was completed in June 2012, and the majority of uprate-related capital improvements were completed during this outage.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 46.4%, 37.7%, and 40.8%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $148.6 million in 2014 primarily due to income tax refunds of $10.1 million in 2014 compared to income tax payments of $211.2 million in 2013. The increase was partially offset by spending on the Grand Gulf refueling outage in 2014 and an increase of $12.9 million in pension contributions in 2014. System Energy made income tax payments in 2013 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The income tax payments in 2013 resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which System Energy had previously claimed a tax deduction. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $132.4 million in 2013 primarily due to income tax payments of $211.2 million in 2013, as discussed above, compared to income tax refunds of $56.8 million in 2012, partially offset by spending on the Grand Gulf refueling outage in 2012. System Energy received income tax refunds in 2012 in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The income tax refunds of $56.8 million in 2012 resulted primarily from a decrease of previously estimated 2011 taxable income due to the recognition of additional bonus depreciation. 

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $107.1 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; 

•an increase in nuclear construction expenditures primarily as a result of spending on nuclear projects during the Grand Gulf refueling outage in 2014; and 

•money pool activity. 

Decreases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow and System Energy’s

receivable from the money pool decreased by $6.9 million in 2014 compared to decreasing by $17.7 million in 2013. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

439
System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $405.8 million in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in construction expenditures resulting from spending on the uprate project at Grand Gulf completed during the refueling outage in 2012 and a decrease in nuclear fuel activity primarily due to the Grand Gulf refueling outage in 2012. The decrease was partially offset by money pool activity.

Decreases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool decreased $17.7 million in 2013 compared to decreasing by $93.5 million in 2012. 

 Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $11 million in 2014 primarily due to:

•the redemption of $70 million of 6.29% Series F notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in September 2013; and

•net borrowings of $20.4 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility in 2014 compared to net repayments of $40 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility in 2013.

The decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $85 million of 3.78% Series I notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in October 2013 and an increase of $31.6 million in common stock dividends paid in 2014. 

Net cash used in financing activities increased $128.4 million in 2013 primarily due to:

•the issuance of $250 million of 4.10% Series first mortgage bonds in September 2012;

•the issuance of $50 million of 4.02% Series H notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in February 2012; and

•the redemption of $70 million of 6.29% Series F notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in September 2013.

The increase was partially offset by:

•the redemption of $152.975 million of pollution control revenue bonds in 2012;

•the redemption of $70 million of 6.2% Series first mortgage bonds in October 2012;

•an increase in borrowings of $40 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility in 2013 compared to the repayment of borrowings of $40 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility in 2012; and

•a decrease of $9.4 million in common stock dividends paid in 2013.

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Capital Structure

System Energy’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of

capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition because net debt indicates System Energy’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Uses of Capital

System Energy requires capital resources for:

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and

•dividend and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other capital investments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to contribute approximately $20.8 million to its pension plans and approximately $475 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2015, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. See “Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $95.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes specific investments and initiatives such as NRC post-Fukushima requirements and plant improvements.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Currently, all of System Energy’s retained earnings are available for distribution.

Sources of Capital

System Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt issuances; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

System Energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common stock issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

System Energy’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

The System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $125 million scheduled to expire in June 2016. As of December 31, 2014, $20.4 million was outstanding on the variable interest entity credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the variable interest entity credit facilities.

System Energy obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2015 for the following:

•short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding;

•long-term borrowings and security issuances; and

•long-term borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. 

See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy’s short-term borrowing limits.

Nuclear Matters

System Energy owns and operates Grand Gulf. System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. Grand Gulf’s operating license is currently due to expire in November

System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

2024. In October 2011, System Energy filed an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf’s operating license to 2044, which application is pending.

In June 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the NRC’s 2010 update to its Waste Confidence Decision, which had found generically that a permanent geologic repository to store spent nuclear fuel would be available when necessary and that spent nuclear fuel could be stored at nuclear reactor sites in the interim without significant environmental effects, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court concluded that the NRC had not satisfied the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when it considered environmental effects in reaching these conclusions. The Waste Confidence Decision has been relied upon by NRC license renewal applicants to address some of the issues that the NEPA requires the NRC to address before it issues a renewed license. Certain nuclear opponents filed requests with the NRC asking it to address the issues raised by the court’s decision in the license renewal proceedings for a number of nuclear plants including Grand Gulf. In August 2012 the NRC issued an order stating that it will not issue final licenses dependent upon the Waste Confidence Decision until the D.C. Circuit’s remand is addressed, but also stating that licensing reviews and proceedings should continue to move forward. In September 2014 the NRC published a new final Waste Confidence rule, named Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, that for licensing purposes adopts non-site specific findings concerning the environmental impacts of the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites - for 60 years, 100 years and indefinitely - after the reactor’s licensed period of operations. The NRC also issued an order lifting its suspension of licensing proceedings after the final rule’s effective date in October 2014. After the final rule became effective, New York, Connecticut, and Vermont filed a challenge to the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The final rule remains in effect while that challenge is pending unless the court orders otherwise.

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Grand Gulf and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in July 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. The task force then issued a second report in September 2011. Based upon the task force’s recommendations, the NRC issued three orders effective on March 12, 2012. The three orders require U.S. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. The NRC, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. System Energy’s estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the NRC orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uses of Capital” above.

Environmental Risks

System Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that 

443
System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of System Energy’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

In the fourth quarter 2014, System Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $99.9 million increase in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.

In the fourth quarter 2013, System Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $102.3 million increase in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

System Energy’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Funding

Total qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2014 was $12.2 million. System Energy anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $16.6 million. System Energy contributed $21.2 million to its pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $20.8 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2015 valuations are completed by April 1, 2015. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for System Energy in 2014 were $561 thousand. System Energy expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $481 thousand. System Energy contributed $334 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute $475 thousand in 2015.

The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2014 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. As a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in October 2014 by the Society of Actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2014 financial disclosures. Adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at December 31, 2014 of $17.7 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.1 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. The new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.7 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. Pension funding guidelines, as established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the October 2014 Society of Actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.
