PART I  

ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

Overview  

FedEx Corporation (FedEx) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four reportable business segments:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

For financial information concerning our reportable business segments, refer to the accompanying financial section, which includes managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and our consolidated financial statements.  

Our Web site is located at fedex.com. Detailed information about our services and our e-commerce tools and solutions can be found on our Web site. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our Web site, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These and other SEC filings are available through the Investor Relations page of our Web site, the address of which is http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. The information on our Web site, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced.  

3   
Strategy  

FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies. Through our holding company, we provide strategic direction to, and coordination of, the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services.  

We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our Web site, fedex.com, provides a single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment tracking, customer service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup and delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped.  

We manage our business as a portfolio  in the long-term best interest of FedEx as a whole, not a particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively, our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of FedEx as a whole.  

While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise. Each companys operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment.  

Our compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate. For example, although the current global recession has negatively impacted all of our companies, our FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Services segments have been disproportionately affected. Meanwhile, our FedEx Ground segment continues to grow. Accordingly, although we have implemented cost-reduction initiatives across the enterprise during 2009, these initiatives have been focused particularly on our FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Services segments. For instance, we have reduced hours, personnel and network capacity at those segments, but we continue to increase network capacity at the FedEx Ground segment, albeit at a slower rate.  

4   
The following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace in the recent past, and despite the current global recession, we believe they will continue to do so over the long term:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access  to goods, services and information. Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability. To this end, we are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the FedEx customer experience. For instance, notwithstanding the current global recession, we continue to invest in long-term strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience. In addition, we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers. For example, in 2009, we:  

    Launched FedEx Express Nacional, a domestic next-business-day service in Mexico, in light of projections of significant growth in Mexicos express shipping market in the next ten years. The new service provides highly reliable and convenient express shipping solutions across Mexico with the support of two new centers of operations that we opened in Toluca and San Luis Potosi.  

    Upgraded FedEx Express international next-business-day delivery service, FedEx International Priority, from Europe to major U.S. East Coast cities. The service enhancements provide our European customers with overnight access to more ZIP codes in key markets along the U.S. East Coast, as well as later pick-up times.  

    Introduced LTL freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. backed by a money-back guarantee. The new service, FedEx Freight A.M., provides our customers with greater flexibility and control over their LTL freight shipments.    

In June 2009, we announced a multi-year agreement with OfficeMax to offer U.S. domestic FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services at all U.S. OfficeMax retail locations (over 900 locations), beginning later in calendar 2009. These additional staffed drop-off locations are expected to complement our existing retail network, including our FedEx Office and Print Centers, and further expand customer access to our services.  

5   
In sum, our overall long-term goal is to:  

    deliver superior financial returns for our stockholders;    

    expand our portfolio of services to meet our customers needs; and    

    execute our compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively strategy with both discipline and imagination.    

Reputation and Responsibility  

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the worlds most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2009, FedEx ranked seventh in FORTUNE magazines Worlds Most Admired Companies list  the eighth consecutive year we have been ranked in the top ten on the list. In addition, FedEx continued to rank highest in customer satisfaction in the University of Michigan Business School National Quality Research Centers American Customer Satisfaction Index in the express delivery category.  

FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation, but also in global citizenship. FedEx understands that a sustainable global business is tied to our global citizenship. We are committed to sustainably connecting the world and enhancing the long-term value of the company for our shareowners and for the communities and businesses that rely on our services. In 2009, we published our first global citizenship report (available at http://about.fedex.designcdt.com/ citizenship_report), which frames how we think about our responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and includes important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities.  

Our People  

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. In 2009, we were listed among FORTUNEs 100 Best Companies to Work for in America  a list that we have made in 11 of the past 12 years. In June 2009, we were listed among Black Enterprise magazines 40 Best Companies for Diversity  a list that we have made for five straight years, since its inception. It is our people  our greatest asset  that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 280,000 team members who are absolutely, positively focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare.  

Our Community  

FedEx is committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work worldwide. We leverage our infrastructure, our people and our philanthropic resources to help these communities achieve their goals. In addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism, we maintain relationships with charitable organizations that enable us to have a strategic impact in key areas, including disaster relief, pedestrian safety, education and diversity.  

6   
Disaster Relief. We provide relief and lifesaving aid to victims of disaster. We work with the following global organizations to assist in relief, recovery and disaster-preparedness planning efforts:  

    American Red Cross: We have provided in-kind shipping, financial support and volunteers to the American Red Cross for more than a decade. We are the organizations largest transportation donor and are recognized as the backbone of its U.S. disaster logistics system.    

    Salvation Army: We provide support for Salvation Army Disaster Response Services. We have provided the Salvation Army with the funding to purchase 13 Emergency Services Response Units  canteen trucks that are deployed during emergencies and disasters and are capable of feeding thousands of people per day.    

    Heart to Heart International: Through our relationship with Heart to Heart International, we have moved disaster relief supplies to many countries throughout the world.    

Safety and Health. We use our global reach and expertise to further the capabilities of the following safety and health organizations, helping to prevent illness and injury:  

    Safe Kids Worldwide: Through programs such as Safe Kids Walk This Way, FedEx and Safe Kids Worldwide have teamed up with local governments to create and improve critical infrastructure and boost support for child-pedestrian safety.    

    ORBIS International: Our pilots volunteer their time to fly ORBIS Internationals Flying Eye Hospital  a converted DC-10 aircraft equipped with surgical and training facilities  to remote locations around the world.    

Education. We support the following organizations that provide students with high-quality educational experiences, allowing them to succeed in the global economy, and we provide minority students access to scholarship funds they need to obtain a higher education.  

    Teach for America: We support Teach for Americas efforts to provide students in urban and rural public schools with a high-quality education and to increase the number and diversity of the organizations teachers.    

    Junior Achievement: Our support of Junior Achievement has helped millions of children a year learn the value of free enterprise and gain skills for success in the global market economy.    

Diversity. We support a number of organizations and programs that promote human rights, equality and the value of cultural differences, including:  

    Minority Scholarship Support: We support minority access to higher education by funding scholarships, such as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the United Negro College Fund and the Asian and Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund.    

    National Civil Rights Museum: FedEx is a major sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum, which educates the public on lessons of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States and its impact and influence on the human rights movement worldwide.    

7   
United Way of America. We believe the United Way is one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting community needs and have supported the annual United Way fundraising campaign since 1975.  

The Environment  

We are committed to protecting the environment. FedEx evaluates the environmental impacts of our packaging and copy and print services, and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention and the use of copy paper with a high recycled content.  

FedEx is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean, alternative and renewable energy sources. First in our industry to introduce hybrid vans in our fleet, we now operate more than 170 hybrid vehicles around the globe, with more than three million miles in revenue service. Our hybrid electric vehicles decrease greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 25 percent and increase fuel economy by over 40 percent compared with conventional vehicles.  

Our solar power generation systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability. In calendar 2005, we installed a solar-electric system atop the FedEx Express regional hub in Oakland. To date, this solar-electric system has provided more than 3 million kilowatt-hours (KWh) of clean energy. Since then, we have installed solar-electric systems at two of FedEx Freights facilities in California, and we are constructing a state-of-the-art, solar-electric sorting-and-handling facility in Cologne, Germany, which is scheduled to be completed in 2010.  

We are also modernizing our aircraft fleet. For example, we are retiring and replacing older Boeing 727s with more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increase our jet fuel efficiency. Also, as noted below, we have selected the fuel-efficient Boeing 777 Freighter (B777F) aircraft to meet future international operational needs.  

Governance  

FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. Reflecting this commitment, we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance listing standards. We have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements. For example, within the past few years, we have:  

    Added a number of highly qualified, independent directors to the Board, including: Steven R. Loranger, the CEO of ITT Corporation; Gary W. Loveman, the CEO of Harrahs Entertainment; and Ambassador Susan C. Schwab, former U.S. Trade Representative.    

    Adopted a majority-voting standard in uncontested director elections and a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote. The Board is prohibited from changing back to a plurality-voting standard without the approval of our stockholders.    

    Amended our bylaws to require stockholder approval for any future poison pill prior to or within 12 months after adoption of the poison pill.    

8   
Our Board of Directors reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, at least annually in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site at http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. We will post in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required. The information on our Web site, however, does not form part of this Report.  

Business Segments  

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments:  

FedEx Express Segment  

FedEx Express  

Overview  

FedEx Express invented express distribution in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through one integrated global network. FedEx Express offers time-certain delivery within one to three business days, serving markets that generate more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, with a money-back guarantee. FedEx Expresss unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the worlds largest express transportation company. FedEx Express employs approximately 140,000 employees and has approximately 57,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office and Print Centers), 654 aircraft and approximately 51,000 vehicles and trailers in its integrated global network.  

Services  

FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Overnight package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to virtually the entire United States population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx Same Day service is available for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express also offers express freight services backed by money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the time-definite global freight market.  

International express delivery with a money-back guarantee is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx Express also offers a comprehensive international freight service, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance.  

For information regarding FedEx Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology.  

International Expansion  

Notwithstanding the current global recession, we remain focused on the long-term expansion of our international presence, especially in key markets such as China, India and Europe.  

9   
We began serving China in 1984, and since that time, we have expanded our service to cover more than 200 cities and counties across the country. We have recently taken several important actions that increase our presence in China and bolster our leadership in the global air cargo industry:  

    In 2009, we began operations at our new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China. The new hub assumed and expanded the activities of our previous hub in Subic Bay, Philippines. We believe the new hub will better serve our global customers doing business in and with the China and Asia-Pacific markets.    

    In 2007, we initiated time-certain domestic delivery service in China. Our China domestic service is supported by a money-back guarantee and real-time package status tracking. Our China domestic network relies on a hub-and-spoke system centered at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, located in East Chinas Zhejiang Province.    

    In 2007, we acquired Tianjin Datian W. Group Co., Ltd.s (DTW Group) fifty percent share of the FedEx-DTW International Priority joint venture and assets relating to DTW Groups domestic network in China. The acquisition converted our joint venture with DTW Group, formed in 1999, into a wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition increased our presence in China in the international market and established our presence in the domestic market.    

In support of our international operations, we are expanding our European hub at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. The expansion project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2010, will substantially increase capacity at the hub. Also, we have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase 30 B777F aircraft, a new high-capacity, long-range airplane, with deliveries beginning in 2010. We also hold an option to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.  

U.S. Postal Service Agreement  

Under an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service that runs through September 2013, FedEx Express provides domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal Service, including for its First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately 5,000 drop boxes at U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery for the U.S. Postal Services international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed (GXG).  

Pricing  

FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. International rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size, weight, destination and, whenever applicable, whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced.  

10   
FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on the average spot price for jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2009 was based on the average spot price for jet fuel published for April 2009. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the average spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2009  17%; 2008  17%; and 2007  13%. These percentages reflect certain fuel surcharge reductions that are associated with our annual base rate increases.  

Operations  

FedEx Expresss primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the companys multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility, which we have significantly expanded recently, is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, and Fort Worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. In June 2009, FedEx Express began operations at a new regional hub in Greensboro, North Carolina.  

Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Guangzhou serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Guangzhou and Paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami  the Miami Gateway Hub  serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets.  

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the stations service area. In some international areas, independent agents (Global Service Participants) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption FedEx Express Segment.  

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, corporate or industrial parks and outside some U.S. Post Offices.  

11   
Fuel Supplies and Costs  

During 2009, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See FedEx Express  Pricing. 

The following table sets forth FedEx Expresss costs for jet fuel and its percentage of consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Approximately 11% of FedEx Expresss requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The remainder of FedEx Expresss requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.  

Competition  

As described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors), the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency and capacity of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings.  

Competitors within the United States include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery concerns, airfreight forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service. DHL exited the U.S. domestic package market during 2009. FedEx Expresss principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, TNT, other foreign postal authorities, freight forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Expresss international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or - -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express.  

Employees  

David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2009, FedEx Express employed approximately 93,000 permanent full-time and 47,000 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 16% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Expresss international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 26% of all employees. FedEx Express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent.  

The pilots of FedEx Express, who constitute a small percentage of our total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and are employed under a four-year collective bargaining agreement that took effect in October 2006. Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees.  

Integration of CTS  

Effective June 1, 2009, Caribbean Transportation Services, Inc. (CTS), a provider of airfreight forwarding services between the United States and Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and the Caribbean Islands, was merged with and into FedEx Express. The purpose of the merger was to leverage synergies between CTS, previously a subsidiary of FedEx Freight Corporation, and FedEx Express and to gain cost efficiencies by maximizing the use of FedEx Express assets for this service offering.  

12   
FedEx Trade Networks  

FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air cargo distribution. FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express at its major hub facilities. Value-added services include Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks publishes customs duty and tax information for over 100 customs areas worldwide. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 3,000 employees and 90 offices in 75 service locations throughout North America and in Asia. Offices are maintained in major European markets and additional Asian locations through dedicated agents.  

FedEx Ground Segment  

FedEx Ground  

Overview  

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back-guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental United States population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental United States population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers.  

FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. In addition, FedEx Ground is in the midst of a major network capacity expansion program, which is expected to increase its daily pick-up capacity to approximately five million packages by calendar 2012. The multi-phase plan includes the addition of hubs, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities. Each of the new hubs will feature the latest automated sorting technology.  

In addition to FedEx Grounds business-to-business service, the company offers FedEx Home Delivery, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated exclusively to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.  

13   
Pricing  

FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Ground contractor or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter.  

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2009 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April 2009. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.  

Operations  

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 520 facilities, including 32 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 22,500 owner-operated vehicles and 31,500 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Deliverys operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.  

Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of over 3.4 million packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx Web site, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology.  

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.  

As of May 31, 2009, FedEx Ground had approximately 45,000 employees and 12,800 independent contractors. David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. DHL exited the U.S. domestic package market during 2009.  

14   
Evolution of Independent Contractor Model  

FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its line-haul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers. Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with its employees and independent contractors is excellent, the company is involved in numerous purported or certified class-action lawsuits and other proceedings that claim or are examining whether the companys owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors) and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a result of this increased regulatory and legal uncertainty, FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with contractors that, among other things, provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by our contractors. As an example, FedEx Ground has an ongoing nationwide program to provide greater incentives to contractors who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. In addition, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues:  

    In 2008, FedEx Ground offered special incentives to encourage California-based single-route contractors to transform their operations into multiple-route businesses or sell their routes to others; and    

    During 2009, FedEx Ground offered special incentives to encourage each New Hampshire-based and Maryland-based single-route pickup-and-delivery contractor to assume responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire geographic service area that includes multiple routes.    

As of May 31, 2009, approximately 60% of all FedEx Ground service areas nationwide are supported by multiple-route contractors, which comprise approximately 35% of all FedEx Ground contractors.  

FedEx SmartPost  

FedEx SmartPost (a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery to residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a U.S. Postal Service facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its network of 22 distribution hubs and approximately 3,200 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery Monday through Saturday to all residential addresses in the U.S., including PO Boxes and military destinations. In 2009, FedEx SmartPost expanded its service into Canada for U.S. shippers by using the residential delivery capabilities of the Canada Post Corporation. The new service, FedEx SmartPost International, is available to all residential addresses, including PO Boxes, in Canada and includes around-the-clock shipment tracking status updates via fedex.com.  

FedEx Freight Segment  

FedEx Freight Corporation  

FedEx Freight Corporation provides a full range of LTL freight services through its FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight services), FedEx National LTL (long-haul LTL freight services) and FedEx Freight Canada businesses, and is known for its exceptional service, reliability and on-time performance.  

Through a comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually all U.S. ZIP Codes (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. In 2009, FedEx Freight reduced its transit times by at least one day in approximately 2,600 service lanes throughout the United States. FedEx Freights services are supported by a no-fee money-back guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers freight delivery service throughout Canada, and FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia via alliances and purchased transportation.  

15   
FedEx Freight specializes in fast-cycle distribution and provides tailored shipping solutions to help shippers meet tight deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers time-critical needs with reduced transit times, after-hours pickup or delivery, or same-day delivery. FedEx Freights fully integrated Web site and other e-tools, including a bill of lading generator and e-mail delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring customers closer to their own account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice service feature uses the companys innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the Internet, e-mail or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. As noted above, in 2009, we introduced FedEx Freight A.M. service  freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. backed by a money-back guarantee.  

Since the acquisition of FedEx National LTL in 2007, we have significantly improved the companys on-time service reliability by integrating and reengineering its network. FedEx National LTL is now a leader when it comes to reliability in the long-haul LTL freight market segment (three-day and more service lanes). FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL have an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to weekly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel.  

As of May 31, 2009, FedEx Freight Corporation was operating approximately 59,000 vehicles and trailers from a network of 480 service centers, and the FedEx Freight segment had approximately 33,000 employees. Douglas G. Duncan is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight Corporation, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freights primary multiregional LTL freight competitors are Con-Way Freight, a subsidiary of Con-way Inc., YRC Regional Transportation, a division of YRC Worldwide Inc., and UPS Freight. FedEx National LTLs primary long-haul LTL freight competitors are YRC National Transportation, a division of YRC Worldwide Inc., and ABF Freight System, Inc.

Technology  

FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smiths vision that the information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy.  

Our technology strategy is driven by our desire for customer satisfaction. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed and reliability. The focal point of our strategy is our award-winning Web site, together with our customer integrated solutions.  

The fedex.com Web site was launched fifteen years ago, and during that time, customers have shipped and tracked billions of packages at fedex.com. The fedex.com Web site is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and customer-focused features. At fedex.com, our customers ship packages, determine international documentation requirements, track package status, pay invoices and access FedEx Office services. The advanced tracking capability within My FedEx provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound, outbound and third-party shipments. FedEx Desktop provides customers the benefit of working offline and having real-time shipment updates sent directly to their computer desktop.  

FedEx Mobile is a suite of services available on most Web-enabled mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry, and includes enhanced support for the iPhone, iPhone 3G and iPod Touch. FedEx Mobile allows customers to track the status of packages, create shipping labels, get account-specific rate quotes and access drop-off location data for FedEx shipments. FedEx also uses wireless data collection devices to scan bar codes on shipments, thereby enhancing and accelerating the package information available to our customers.  

We design our e-commerce tools and solutions to be easily integrated into our customers applications, as well as into third-party software being developed by leading e-procurement, systems integration and enterprise resource planning companies. Our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their shipping and associated processes.  

In 2009, we launched new, state-of-the-art tracking technologies to provide customers with real-time visibility to shipment status via Web, desktop or mobile devices. Available globally in over 25 languages, the new tracking experience includes a shipment progression graphic enabling users to get tracking information. Users now have the ability to view tracking results based on different time zones, order or shipment events and weight conventions. Tracking numbers can also be saved, eliminating the need to reenter data for subsequent tracks.

We are in full compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.  

ISO 9001 Certification  

FedEx Services provides our customers with a high level of service quality, as evidenced by our ISO 9001 certification for our global express and ground operations. ISO 9001 registration is required by thousands of customers around the world. FedExs global certification, encompassing the processes of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services, enhances our single-point-of-access strategy and solidifies our reputation as the quality leader in the transportation industry. ISO 9001 is currently the most rigorous international standard for Quality Management and Assurance. ISO standards were developed by the International Organization for Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland to promote and facilitate international trade. More than 150 countries, including European Union members, the United States and Japan, recognize ISO standards.  

FedEx Global Supply Chain Services  

FedEx Services offers a range of supply chain solutions, including critical inventory logistics, transportation management, fulfillment and fleet services, through its FedEx Global Supply Chain Services subsidiary. FedEx Global Supply Chain Services focuses on information technology-sensitive business to meet the needs of its customers and to drive transportation business to other FedEx operating companies. FedEx Global Supply Chain Services service offerings use advanced electronic data interchanges to speed communications between customers and their suppliers, resulting in more cost-effective solutions and enhanced levels of customer service.  

FedEx Office  

FedEx Office is a leading provider of document and business services. FedEx Offices global network of digitally-connected locations offers access to copying and digital printing, professional finishing, document creation, signs and graphics, direct mail, Web-based printing, Internet access, computer rentals, videoconferencing and the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services.  

18   
FedEx Office offers the full range of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services at virtually all U.S. locations. In addition, FedEx Office offers packing services at virtually all U.S. Office and Print Centers, and packing supplies and boxes are included in FedEx Offices retail product assortment. By allowing customers to have unpackaged items professionally packed by specially trained FedEx Office team members and then shipped using any of the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services, FedEx Office provides a complete pack-and-ship solution.  

In response to challenging business conditions, during 2009, FedEx Office initiated an internal reorganization designed to improve its revenue-generating capabilities and reduce costs. Several actions were taken during 2009 to reduce the companys cost structure and position the company for long-term profitability in connection with broader economic recovery. We expect that future strategies to increase revenue at FedEx Office will focus on the companys core competencies relating to copying, digital printing and shipping services.  

As of May 31, 2009, FedEx Offices operations included approximately 1,800 FedEx Office and Print Centers in the United States and 135 additional locations in seven other countries, as well as 29 commercial production centers. FedEx Office is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.  

Trademarks  

The FedEx trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, FedEx Customer Information Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.  

Regulation  

Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.  

The FAAs regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.  

The DOTs authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOTs jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.  

19   
Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. In July 2007, the TSA issued to us a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contained many new and enhanced security requirements. These requirements are not static, but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, and to respond to evolving threats. Until these requirements are adopted, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.  

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Expresss wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for charter flights.  

Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.  

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.  

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.  

International. FedEx Expresss international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOTs approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments.  

Our operations within foreign countries, such as FedEx Expresss growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict, and sometimes prohibit, our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market. As an example, in 2009, the Chinese government adopted postal regulation that excludes foreign-invested companies such as FedEx from competing in the China domestic document delivery market.  

Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Expresss activities pertaining to satellite communications.  

20   
Environmental. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Expresss aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Expresss aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Expresss significant markets. Congresss passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Expresss international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.  

Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors).  

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Offices copy machines. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.  

Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.  

Labor. While labor relations within the United States at most of our companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the NLRA), all U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the RLA). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.  

21   
The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting national (now global) commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.  

The U.S. Congress is considering adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize small units of our employees. For example, there is a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. For a description of these potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors).
