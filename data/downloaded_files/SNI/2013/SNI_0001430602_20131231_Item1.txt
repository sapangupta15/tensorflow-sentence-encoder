ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  

Scripps Networks Interactive is one of the leading developers of lifestyle-oriented content for television and the Internet with respected, high-profile television and interactive brands. Our businesses engage audiences and efficiently serve advertisers by delivering entertaining and highly useful content that focuses on specifically defined topics of interest.  

We manage our operations through our reportable operating segment, Lifestyle Media. Lifestyle Media includes our national television networks, Food Network, Home and Garden Television (HGTV), Travel Channel, DIY Network (DIY), Cooking Channel and Great American Country. Lifestyle Media also includes websites that are associated with the aforementioned television brands and other Internet-based businesses serving food, home and travel related categories.  

We also have established lifestyle media brands internationally. Our lifestyle-oriented channels are available in the United Kingdom, other European markets, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. The results for our international businesses are not separately identified as a reportable segment and are included within our corporate and other segment caption.  

Our businesses earn revenue principally from advertising sales, affiliate fees and ancillary sales, including the sale and licensing of consumer products. Programming expenses, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are our primary operating costs.  

We seek to engage audiences that are highly desirable to advertisers with entertaining and informative lifestyle content that is produced for television, the Internet and any other media platforms consumers choose. We intend to expand and enhance our lifestyle brands through the creation of popular new programming and content, the use of new distribution platforms, such as mobile phones and video-on-demand, the licensing and sale of branded consumer products and through international expansion.  

BUSINESS SEGMENTS  

Lifestyle Media  

Our Lifestyle Media business segment includes six national television networks and our portfolio of related interactive lifestyle brands. The segment generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising time on national television networks and interactive media platforms and from affiliate fees paid by cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite services and other

 distributors that carry our network programming. In 2013, revenues from advertising sales and affiliate fees were approximately 69 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total revenue for the Lifestyle Media segment. Our Lifestyle Media segment also earns revenue from the licensing of its content to third parties and the licensing of its brands for consumer products such as videos, books, kitchenware, and tools.  

The advertising revenue generated by our national television networks depends on the viewership ratings as determined by Nielsen Media Research and other third-party research companies and the advertising rates paid by advertisers for the company to deliver advertisements to certain viewer demographics. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. Advertising revenue can fluctuate relative to the popularity of specific programs, blocks of programming during defined periods of the day and seasonal demand of advertisers. Affiliate fee revenues are negotiated with individual cable television and direct-to-home satellite operators and other distributors. The negotiations typically result in multi-year carriage agreements with scheduled rate increases. As an incentive to obtain long-term distribution agreements for our networks, we have made cash payments to cable and direct-to-home satellite operators, provided an initial period during which a distributors affiliate fee payments are waived, or both. The amount of the fee we receive is determined by the number of subscribers with access to our network programming.  

Programming expense, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are the primary operating costs of our Lifestyle Media segment. Program amortization represented 44 percent of Lifestyle Media expenses in 2013 reflecting our continued investment in the improved quality and variety of programming on our networks. We incur sales and marketing expenses to support brand-building initiatives at all of our television networks.  

Our lifestyle-oriented interactive businesses are focused on the internal development and acquisition of interactive media brands that are intended to diversify sources of revenue and enhance our competitive advantage as a leading provider of food, home, travel and lifestyle content. Revenue generated by our lifestyle interactive businesses is derived primarily from the sale of display, banner, rich media and video advertising.  

The lifestyle-oriented interactive businesses consist of multiple websites, including our six network-branded websites, Foodnetwork.com, HGTV.com, Travelchannel.com, DIYNetwork.com, Cookingchanneltv.com and GACTV.com. In addition to serving as the home websites for the segments television programming networks, the websites provide informational and instructional content on specific topics within their broader lifestyle content categories. All of the segments interactive businesses benefit from archived television network programming of which approximately 94 percent is owned by us. Our ownership of programming enables us to efficiently and economically repurpose it for use on the Internet and other interactive distribution channels, including mobile and video-on-demand.  

The lifestyle websites accounted for about 4 percent of the segments total revenue in 2013. The strategic focus of the lifestyle interactive businesses is to grow advertising revenues by increasing video plays and attracting more unique visitors to our websites through site enhancements and adding more video. Our strategy also includes attracting a broader audience through the placement of our video programming on national video streaming sites, developing new sources of revenue that capitalize on traffic growth at our websites and capitalizing on the movement of advertising dollars to mobile platforms.  

We also have 50 percent ownership interests in Food Network Magazine JV and HGTV Magazine JV, and a 7.25 percent ownership interest in Fox-BRV Southern Sports Holdings LLC, which comprises the Sports South and Fox Sports Net South regional television networks.

We initiated our international channel strategy with the 2009 launch of Food Network on B-Sky-B in the United Kingdom, reaching 10 million households.

Travel Channel International Ltd. (TCI) was acquired in 2012 along with its base of operations in London, England. TCI is broadcast in 21 languages across a wide network of affiliates throughout Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. In 2013, TCI also became available on Freeview in primetime in the UK.  

In 2011 we acquired 50% of UKTV, a television entity that is co-owned by the BBC, and represents a portfolio of 10 general entertainment and lifestyle channels in the UK, including channels in the home and food categories. We also continue to partner with Shaw Media on three very popular lifestyle channels in Canada: HGTV Canada, Food Network Canada, and DIY Network Canada.  

Our international businesses earn revenues primarily from advertising sales, affiliate fees, and the licensing of programming to third parties. Satellite transmission fees, programming expense, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are the primary operating costs of our international businesses.  

Competition  

Cable and satellite network programming is a highly competitive business in the U.S. and worldwide. Our cable and satellite networks and websites generally compete for advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television networks, online and mobile outlets, radio programming and print media. Our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast networks, local over-the-air television stations, competitors pay and basic cable television networks, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services, online activities and other forms of news, information and entertainment. Our networks also compete with other television networks for distribution and affiliate fees derived from distribution agreements with cable television operators, satellite operators and other distributors.  

Intellectual Property  

Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, websites, and licenses from third parties. To defend these assets, we rely upon a combination of common law, statutory, and contractual legal protections. There can be no assurance, however, of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues.  

Regulatory Matters  

The Companys businesses are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the laws and regulations of international countries and bodies such as the European Union (the EU), and these laws and regulations are subject to change. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) regulates cable television operators and satellite operators, which could affect our cable networks indirectly.  

Closed Captioning  

All of our cable networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for hearing impaired. The 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 also requires us to provide closed captioning on certain video programming that we offer on the Internet.  

CALM Act  

FCC rules require multichannel video programming distributors to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and our affiliation agreements generally require us to certify compliance with such standards.  

Must-Carry Requirements  

The FCCs implementation of the statutory must-carry obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space. In contrast, programming networks, such as ours, have no guaranteed right of carriage on cable television or DBS systems. This may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and DBS operators.

Regulation of the Internet and Mobile Applications

The operation of these websites and distribution of these apps are subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy and consumer protection regulations.
