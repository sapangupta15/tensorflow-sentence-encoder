The ITW Business Model

The powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. This business model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:

•ITW’s 80/20 management process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980’s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;

•Customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 management process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and subsequently creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 17,000 granted and pending patents;

•ITW’s decentralized, entrepreneurial culture allows ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services adapted to each business' customers and end markets.

Enterprise Strategy

In late 2012, ITW began the process of transitioning the Company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. Since then, ITW has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the Company’s strong financial performance over the past four years.

The roots of ITW’s Enterprise Strategy began in late 2011 / early 2012, when the Company undertook a complete review of its performance. Focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, ITW developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.

Based on this rigorous evaluation, ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. To shift its primary growth engine to organic, the Company began executing a multi-step approach.

•The first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of ITW’s business portfolio. As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.

As a result of this work, ITW’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. The Company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest / most profitable customers and product lines. With the initiative nearly complete and ITW businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance, the Company believes that the significant product line simplification work is essentially finalized and will return to more normalized levels in 2017 and beyond.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The Strategic Sourcing initiative was established as a core capability to better leverage ITW’s scale and improve global competitiveness. Sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability at ITW. The Company’s 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2016 and is on track to do the same in 2017 and 2018.

•With the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company was able to shift its focus to preparing for and accelerating, organic growth. As a preparatory step, ITW is in the process of reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.

Once the business has achieved operational excellence and identified the right growth opportunities, the final step is to accelerate organic growth. The process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months.

Based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process, the Company believes that its organic growth framework is capable of delivering above-market organic growth across all segments. Divisions

are at various phases in preparation for growth and many are either ready to grow or already growing above their respective markets. ITW management is fully aligned with this plan and very focused on executing it. With the close of 2016, approximately 85 percent of the divisions are ready to grow.

Path to Full Potential

While the Company has made considerable progress and ITW’s performance is nearing best-in-class levels, the Company has significant opportunity for further improvement before it achieves full operating potential. In order to do so, ITW is focused on two key areas of opportunity, including: additional structural margin improvement and sustained above-market organic growth with strong incremental profitability.

Additional Structural Margin Improvement

To deliver on the additional structural margin improvement, the Company is implementing the following two levers: (1) further leveraging the 80/20 management process and (2) strategic sourcing.

•The first lever, better leveraging the full power of the ITW Business Model, will be accomplished through a much more consistent and focused approach to 80/20 best practice implementation across the Company. The 80/20 management system has continuously been refined, improved and expanded into a unique holistic business management process of interconnected tools, which improves all aspects of the business and, when applied consistently and executed more effectively, will lead to additional margin improvement. ITW has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. These 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.

•The second lever, strategic sourcing, is a core element of ITW’s ongoing operational strategy and a sustainable enterprise-wide capability. Through the continued execution of this initiative, the Company expects to deliver additional margin improvement with the goal of a one percent reduction in spend in 2017 and 2018.

Sustained Above-Market Organic Growth with Strong Incremental Profitability

ITW has done extensive work on its portfolio and operating structure to position the Company to deliver sustainable above-market organic growth. The Company has narrowed the focus and significantly improved the growth potential of ITW’s business portfolio. With approximately 85% of its divisions ready to grow as of the end of 2016, ITW is well positioned for accelerated growth in 2017 and beyond. To deliver on this accelerated growth, the divisions have been implementing the organic growth framework, which includes continued investment in customer-back innovation and a strengthened focus on market penetration. ITW continues to focus on growing its share of "80" products with existing customers with whom the Company has a resonant value proposition as well as target potential new customers with similar pain points to existing customers. ITW has made strong progress on the Company’s pivot to organic growth and is well positioned to deliver on sustained above-market organic growth over the long-term.

Divestiture Activity

Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment— On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Effective November 1, 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. 

Divestiture of the Industrial Packaging Segment— In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. 

On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2017 were not material as of December 31, 2016.

Competition

With operations in 57 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the Welding segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and ESAB.

In virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference and service delivery. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments. The Company believes that each segment's primary competitive advantages derive from the Company's business model and decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the Company's 80/20 management process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Automotive OEM segment.

Raw Materials

The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins and chemicals, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.

Research and Development

Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment all contribute to the Company's organic growth. Many new products are designed to reduce customers' costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly or improving the quality of customers' assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $223 million in 2016, $218 million in 2015 and $227 million in 2014.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns approximately 3,500 unexpired U.S. patents and 7,400 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,500 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,800 applications pending in foreign patent offices. There is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains a patent group for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.

The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company's patents would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.

In addition to patents, many of the Company's products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the Company's businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Automotive OEM segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment; Instron in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment; Miller in the Welding segment; Rain-X and Permatex in the Polymers & Fluids segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Hi-Cone in the Specialty Products segment.

Environmental

The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows. 

Employees

The Company employed approximately 50,000 persons as of December 31, 2016 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

International

The Company's international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 56 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as automotive OEM/tiers, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, construction, and others on a worldwide basis. The Company's revenues from sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 55% of revenues in 2016, 54% of revenues in 2015, and 57% of revenues in 2014.

Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14. Segment Information in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain potential risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries,
