Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2010 was a year marked by continued global and economic challenges and yet also was a year in which we made significant progress with cost initiatives, strengthened our overall capital position and had strong execution that allowed us to deliver improved financial results. Cash generated from our manufacturing businesses enabled us to continue to invest in products and technologies that will position us for future growth as the economy recovers.  

We completed our restructuring program in 2010, which has driven out costs in all of our segments. Since the inception of the program in late 2008, we have lowered our headcount by 28% and have exited 30 facilities.  

During 2010, we continued to make significant progress in our plan to exit the non-captive commercial finance business in our Finance segment by liquidating a total of $2.4 billion in finance receivables across the segment, $1.8 billion of which were receivables in our non-captive portfolio, through discounted payoffs, portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization.  

Our liquidity position strengthened during the year as our businesses generated positive operating cash flow. As a result, we paid off the Manufacturing groups drawn $1.25 billion credit facility in its entirety and paid down the Finance groups $1.75 billion drawn credit facility by $300 million. In addition, we strengthened the funding level of our pension plans with a $350 million voluntary contribution in the fourth quarter of 2010.  

Revenues  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Revenues increased $25 million in 2010, compared with 2009. This increase was due to significant revenue increases in the Industrial, Bell and Textron Systems segments that were largely offset by lower revenue in the Cessna and Finance segments. The net revenue increase included the following factors:  

      Higher revenues of $446 million in the Industrial segment, largely due to higher volume reflecting improvements in the automotive industry;  

      Bells revenue increased $399 million, primarily due to higher V-22 and H-1 volume and improved pricing in its commercial business; and  

      Textron Systems revenue increased $80 million, primarily due to higher UAS volume;  

      Partially offset by lower revenues at Cessna of $757 million, primarily due to lower business jet volume; and  

      A $143 million reduction in Finance segment revenues, largely due to lower average finance receivables resulting from the continued liquidation.    

In 2009, revenues decreased $3.5 billion, 25%, to $10.5 billion, compared with 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the following factors:  

      Lower manufacturing volume of $3.3 billion, reflecting:    

      $2.4 billion decrease at Cessna, primarily related to fewer deliveries due to the economic recession;  

      $801 million decrease in the Industrial segment, principally due to recession-related lower demand; and a  

      $79 million decrease at Bell, largely related to lower commercial helicopter volume as a result of the economic recession.    

      Lower Finance segment revenues of $362 million, reflecting an increase in portfolio losses, lower market interest rates and lower securitization income; and  

      Unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $51 million in the Industrial segment;  

      Partially offset by higher pricing of $155 million, primarily at Bell and Cessna.    

18    

Cost of Sales  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Cost of sales as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues remained flat at 83.5% in 2010 and 2009. On a dollar basis, cost of sales increased $137 million, 2%, in 2010, compared with 2009, principally due to the net sales volume changes in the Industrial, Bell and Cessna segments described above, as well as higher pension costs and inflation. In 2010, favorable conversion costs in the Bell and Industrial segments, resulting from improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes, were offset by increased conversion costs at Cessna. Conversion costs increased at Cessna as cost reduction activities, including workforce reductions and facility consolidations, did not fully offset the impact of lower production volumes.  

Cost of sales as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues increased to 83.5% in 2009 from 79.6% in 2008. On a dollar basis, cost of sales decreased $2.1 billion, 20%, in 2009, compared with 2008, principally due to the sales volume changes in the Cessna and Industrial segments described above. In 2009, cost of sales was unfavorably impacted from lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns in the Cessna and Industrial segments resulting in increased conversion costs and idle capacity.  

Selling and Administrative Expense  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Selling and administrative expense decreased $107 million, 8%, to $1.2 billion in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to $41 million in lower expenses in the Finance segment reflecting lower compensation and related costs due to headcount reductions associated with its exit from the non-captive commercial finance business, $39 million of lower commissions primarily resulting from lower Cessna sales volume, and $27 million lower corporate expenses.  

In 2009, selling and administrative expense decreased $252 million, 16%, to $1.3 billion, compared with 2008, primarily due to workforce reductions and furlough programs resulting in lower compensation and related costs, lower sales commissions at Cessna, and a decline in professional services and travel costs due to cost-reduction efforts.  

Special Charges  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business. This restructuring program primarily included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of certain operations throughout the company. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we initiated the final series of restructuring actions under this program, which included workforce reductions in the Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments and at Corporate, along with the decision to exit a plant in the Industrial segment. With the completion of this program at the end of 2010, we have terminated approximately 12,100 positions worldwide representing approximately 28% of our global workforce since the inception of the program and have exited 30 leased and owned facilities and plants.  

Special charges included restructuring charges of $99 million, $237 million and $64 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges. In 2010, special charges also included a $91 million non-cash pre-tax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the Statement of Operations as a result of substantially liquidating a Canadian Finance entity. In 2009, special charges also include a goodwill impairment charge of $80 million in the Industrial segment. In 2008, special charges include an initial mark-to-market adjustment of $293 million that was made when we classified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale in connection with our decision to sell the non-captive portion of our Finance business, along with a goodwill impairment charge of $169 million in the Finance segment.  

19    

Interest Expense  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes interest for both the Finance and Manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated. Interest expense for the Finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest.  

Our consolidated interest expense decreased $39 million, 13%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to a $63 million decrease for the Finance group, largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the non-captive commercial finance business. This decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense for the Manufacturing group of $24 million, primarily due to the full year impact in 2010 of Convertible Notes issued in May 2009. In 2009, consolidated interest expense decreased $139 million, 31%, compared with 2008, primarily due to reduced debt in the Finance group as it liquidated receivables.  

Segment Analysis  

We operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: Cessna, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Finance. Segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. Segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses and special charges. The measurement for the Finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges.  

In our discussion of comparative results for the Manufacturing group, changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed in terms of volume, pricing, foreign exchange and acquisitions. Additionally, changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix, inflation and cost performance. Volume changes in revenue represents increases/decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided. Pricing represents changes in unit pricing. Foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. Acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months. For segment profit, mix represents a change due to the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins. Inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension or other costs. Cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, product line profitability, start-up, ramp-up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs. For the U.S. Government business, performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved (or deteriorated) operating performance on the contract and are recognized by recording cumulative catch-up adjustments in the current period.  

Cessna  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Cessna Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Cessnas revenues decreased $757 million, 23%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to lower volume of business jets, reflecting the continued downturn in the business jet market attributable to the economic recession. We delivered 179 Citation business jets in 2010 versus 289 jets in 2009. Increased aircraft utilization and our investment in additional service capacity during 2010 contributed to increased aftermarket volume as Cessnas aftermarket revenues increased by $80 million, 14%, from 2009.  

20    

Operating expenses decreased by $530 million, 17%, in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to a decline in direct material and labor costs, principally as a result of the reduced volume. During 2010, Cessnas cost reduction activities were not able to fully offset the lower volume.  

Factors contributing to the 2009 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Cessnas revenues decreased $2.3 billion, 41%, in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due to lower volume of business jets, reflecting the economic recession. We delivered 289 Citation business jets in 2009 versus 467 jets in 2008. Cessnas 2009 revenues also were affected by lower aftermarket volume of $152 million, largely due to a decline in aircraft utilization resulting from the economic recession, and CitationAir had lower volume of $79 million, primarily due to lower demand.  

Operating expenses decreased $1.6 billion, 34%, in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due to lower sales volumes of new aircraft. Additionally, engineering, selling and administrative expense declined by an aggregate $116 million largely due to the workforce reductions in 2009 and $82 million in forfeiture income from order cancellations, partially offset by higher warranty expense of $35 million and a $16 million increase in write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory, reflecting lower fair market values due to an excess supply in the market.  

Cessna Segment Profit (Loss)  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Cessnas segment profit decreased $227 million, 115%, in 2010, compared with 2009, due to the $253 million impact from lower volume, a nonrecurring $50 million gain on the 2009 sale of CESCOM assets and $19 million of inflation, net of higher pricing, partially offset by improved performance of $95 million. The improved performance included lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses of $57 million, lower inventory reserves and pre-owned aircraft write-downs of $48 million, and lower tooling costs of $19 million, partially offset by lower deposit forfeiture income of $49 million due to fewer order cancellations in 2010.  

Factors contributing to 2009 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, Cessnas segment profit decreased $707 million, 78%, compared with 2008, primarily due to an $883 million impact from lower volume, which included $48 million due to idle capacity related to lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns. These decreases were partially offset by $131 million of favorable performance and a $50 million gain on the 2009 sale of assets related to CESCOM, which provided maintenance tracking services to Cessnas customers. Cessnas favorable performance included $116 million in lower engineering, selling and administrative expense largely due to the workforce reductions in 2009 and $82 million in forfeiture income from order cancellations, partially offset by higher warranty expense of $35 million, a $16 million increase in write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory, reflecting lower fair market values due to an excess supply in the market, and unfavorable CitationAir performance of $10 million.  

21    

Cessna Backlog  

Backlog decreased $2.0 billion, 40%, in 2010, compared with 2009, mainly attributable to canceled business jet orders due to continued weakness in the general aviation industry and aircraft deliveries in excess of orders. In 2009, the 66% decrease in backlog reflects the cancellation of numerous business jets orders, largely due to the economic recession, and included a $2.1 billion impact from our decision to cancel the development of the Citation Columbus aircraft and a $1.3 billion impact due to cancellations by one customer. 

Bell  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Bell manufactures helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and provides services for military and/or commercial markets. Bells major U.S. Government programs at this time are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters, which are both in the production stage and represent a significant portion of Bells revenues from the U.S. Government. During 2010, we have continued to ramp up production and deliveries to meet customer schedule requirements for these programs.  

Bell Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Revenues increased $399 million, 14%, in 2010, compared with 2009, with volume representing 83% of the increase. Bells V-22 program revenues increased by $230 million, 25%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily reflecting higher aircraft deliveries as we delivered 26 V-22 aircraft in 2010 versus 20 aircraft in 2009. Other military revenues increased $123 million, 17%, in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to an increase in volume of $113 million due to higher deliveries of our H-1 aircraft, partially offset by the impact from revenues recognized in 2009 on the canceled Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program of $28 million. H-1 aircraft deliveries increased from 9 aircraft in 2009 to 18 aircraft in 2010. Additionally, the Kiowa Warrior Program generated slightly higher volume in 2010. Commercial revenues increased 4% in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to improved pricing.  

Bells operating expenses increased 11% in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to the higher net sales volume, partially offset by improved cost performance. Improved cost performance primarily related to the V-22 and H-1 programs and unfavorable adjustments recorded in 2009 for the 429 program as discussed below, partially offset by $14 million in higher research and development costs.  

Factors contributing to the 2009 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Revenues increased $15 million, 1%, in 2009, compared with 2008, as other items such as higher pricing of $94 million, primarily related to certain commercial helicopters, offset reduced volume. Bells V-22 program revenues increased by $80 million, 9%, in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily reflecting higher aircraft deliveries. We delivered 20 V-22 aircraft in 2009 versus 18 aircraft in 2008. In 2009, other military revenues decreased 3% from 2008, primarily due to a $76 million reduction related to the canceled Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program and lower H-1 aircraft deliveries. H-1 aircraft deliveries decreased to 9 aircraft in 2009 from 12 aircraft in 2008. These reductions were partially offset by higher volume of $28 million for the Kiowa Warrior Safety  

22    

Enhancement Program, $13 million related to the H-1 higher production support and $14 million in higher aftermarket volume. In 2009, commercial revenues decreased 3% from 2008, primarily due to lower helicopter and aftermarket volume of $130 million, partially offset by higher pricing of $84 million.  

Bells operating expenses decreased by $11 million in 2009, compared with 2008, as improved cost performance, which included lower selling and administrative and research and development expense of $47 million, and lower net sales volume were partially offset by inflation.  

Bell Segment Profit  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Bells segment profit increased $123 million, 40%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to improved performance of $106 million and higher pricing, net of inflation of $23 million. Sales volume did not have a significant net impact on segment profit due to the mix of commercial and military aircraft sold. The improved performance was largely due to the following factors:  

      $73 million attributable to the V-22 and H-1 programs, resulting from a $38 million favorable impact from efficiencies realized in connection with the ramp-up of production lines, $21 million in profit recognized in the second quarter of 2010 related to the reimbursement of prior year costs and $14 million of lower material costs; and  

      An $18 million net improvement from unfavorable adjustments recorded in 2009 for the 429 program that did not occur in 2010;  

      Partially offset by $14 million in higher research and development costs.    

Factors contributing to 2009 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, Bells segment profit increased $26 million, 9%, compared with 2008, primarily due to higher pricing in excess of inflation of $47 million and improved cost performance of $19 million, partially offset by a change in product mix of $22 million, primarily due to commercial helicopters and lower volume of $18 million. The improved cost performance primarily reflects lower selling and administrative expense of $26 million, lower research and development expense of $21 million and improvement in the V-22 program of $16 million, partially offset by unfavorable adjustments of $24 million for the 429 model, primarily due to inventory write-downs resulting from changes in pricing assumptions and higher than anticipated learning curve costs.  

Bell Backlog  

In 2010, Bells backlog increased $296 million, 4%, largely related to the V-22 and H-1 programs, partially offset by a decline in commercial backlog reflecting deliveries in excess of new orders. Backlog at Bell increased 11% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to funding for the V-22 program, partially offset by a decline in commercial aircraft orders, largely due to the economic recession. 

Textron Systems  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

23    

Textron Systems Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Revenues at Textron Systems increased $80 million, 4%, in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to a $151 million increase in our UAS product line revenues, primarily due to higher volume, partially offset by a $55 million decrease in our Land and Marine Systems and Weapons and Sensors product lines.  

Textron Systems operating expenses increased $90 million, 5%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net sales volume and inflation, primarily due to higher pension costs.  

Factors contributing to the 2009 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, revenues at Textron Systems increased $19 million, 1%, compared with 2008, primarily due to a $55 million increase in our UAS product line revenues, primarily due to higher volume, partially offset by a $36 million decrease in our Mission Support and Other product line, largely due to lower aircraft engine volume resulting from a decline in aircraft production as aircraft manufacturers cut production levels in response to lower demand.  

Textron Systems operating expenses increased $30 million, 2%, in 2009, compared with 2008, principally due to higher net sales volume.  

Textron Systems Segment Profit  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Segment profit at Textron Systems decreased $10 million in 2010, 4%, compared with 2009, as the $26 million impact of the higher UAS volume was offset by a $19 million impact from lower volumes in the Land and Marine Systems and Weapons and Sensors product lines and $14 million in inflation, primarily due to higher pension costs.  

Factors contributing to 2009 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, segment profit at Textron Systems decreased $11 million, 4%, compared with 2008, primarily due to the $28 million impact of lower volume in the Mission Support and Other product line, partially offset by the $22 million impact of higher volumes in the Weapons and Sensors and UAS product lines.  

Textron Systems Backlog  

In 2009, backlog decreased $526 million, 24%, primarily due to deliveries on existing government contracts for UAS and armored security vehicles. 

24    

Industrial  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Industrial Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales of fuel systems and functional components increased 27% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher volume reflecting improvements in the automotive industry, partially offset by a $19 million impact due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, largely related to the euro. Other industrial revenues increased 12% due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $15 million, largely due to fluctuations with the euro.  

The Industrial segments operating expenses increased $311 million, 15%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to higher sales volumes and inflation, partially offset by improved cost performance, largely due to the significant efforts made in 2009 to reduce costs through workforce reductions and other initiatives.  

Factors contributing to the 2009 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, sales of fuel systems and functional components decreased 27% from 2008 primarily due to lower volume, reflecting lower demand due to the economic recession, and a $46 million impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, largely due to fluctuations with the euro. Other industrial revenues decreased 32% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower volume.  

Operating expenses decreased $800 million, 28%, in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower costs due to workforce reductions, employee furloughs and temporary plant shutdowns.  

Industrial Segment Profit  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Industrial segment profit increased $135 million, 500%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to the $127 million impact from higher volume and $76 million in improved performance, partially offset by inflation in excess of higher pricing of $59 million. The improved cost performance in 2010 was largely due to the significant efforts made in 2009 to reduce costs through workforce  

25    

reductions and other initiatives, along with improved manufacturing leverage due to higher volume.  

Factors contributing to 2009 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, Industrial segment profit decreased $40 million, 60%, compared with 2008, primarily due to the $265 million impact from lower volume, partially offset by improved cost performance of $211 million and lower inflation of $21 million. Cost performance improved largely due to significant efforts made to reduce costs through workforce reductions, employee furloughs and temporary plant shutdowns.  

Finance  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Our plan to exit the non-captive commercial finance business in our Finance segment is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales. The exit of the non-captive business is expected to be substantially completed over the next three to five years, depending on market conditions.  

Finance Revenues  

Finance segment revenues decreased $143 million, 40%, in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to the following:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, Finance segment revenues decreased $362 million, 50%, compared with 2008, primarily due to the following:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Portfolio losses, net of gains decreased in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily as a result of $40 million in lower impairment charges in the structured capital portfolio, $23 million in gains on the sale of two distribution finance receivable portfolios in 2010 and a $21 million decrease in discounts taken on the sale or early termination of finance assets associated with the liquidation of distribution finance receivables, partially offset by an $11 million increase in impairment charges on owned aircraft that are subject to operating lease or have been repossessed.  

Portfolio losses recognized in 2009 include discounts taken on the sale or early termination of finance assets, including $60 million in discounts associated with the liquidation of distribution finance and golf mortgage finance receivables, $53 million in impairment charges related to automobile manufacturing equipment and investments in real estate associated with matured leveraged leases in the structured capital portfolio, and $25 million in impairment charges associated with repossessed aircraft.  

Finance Segment Loss  

The Finance segment loss decreased by $57 million, 19%, in 2010, compared with 2009, as the provision for loan losses decreased by $124 million, primarily due to a decline in the accounts identified as nonaccrual during the year, and we had $81 million in lower portfolio losses, net of gains and $28 million in lower securitization losses, net of gains. These improvements were partially offset by the  

26    

impact of lower gains on debt extinguishment of $54 million, a $16 million impact from lower interest rates on debt and $16 million in lower accretion of the valuation allowance on finance receivables held for sale. In addition, as we effected the exit of our non-captive finance business, our lower average finance receivables had a $52 million unfavorable impact on segment profit, along with $39 million in lower servicing fees, investment and other income and a $26 million impact related to variable-rate receivable interest rate floors. These factors were partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses of $41 million, primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with the workforce reduction.  

In 2009, the Finance segments loss increased $244 million, 488%, compared with 2008, primarily due to a $157 million impact from higher portfolio losses, $70 million in lower securitization gains, net of impairments, $37 million in higher suspended earnings on nonaccrual finance receivables and a $33 million increase in provision for loan losses, partially offset by $55 million in gains on debt extinguishment. In 2009 and 2008, we increased the provision for loan losses significantly in response to the economic recession, declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers. We also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance business in the fourth quarter of 2008, which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio. In 2009, the increase was primarily due to an increase in both the rate and severity of defaults resulting from the economic recession and due to declining aircraft values. The increase was partially offset by a $73 million decrease in the provision for the distribution finance portfolio largely due to the liquidation of 68% of its managed finance receivables in 2009.  

Finance Portfolio Quality  

The following table reflects information about the Finance segments credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment. Finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

At the end of 2010, finance receivables included $1.9 billion in finance receivables held for investment in the non-captive business, compared with $3.3 billion at the end of 2009. In addition, finance receivables held for sale by the non-captive business totaled $0.4 billion at the end of 2010, compared with $0.8 billion at the end of 2009. These decreases were due to the continued exit of this business as discussed above.  

Nonaccrual finance receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three months, unless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful as well as accounts whose credit quality indicators other than delinquency suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful. We believe that the percentage of nonaccrual finance receivables generally will remain high as we execute our non-captive liquidation plan. The liquidation plan is also likely to result in a slower rate of liquidation for nonaccrual finance receivables. Nonaccrual finance receivables decreased $190 million from the 2009 year-end balance, with a $117 million reduction in the aviation product line, a $55 million reduction in the distribution finance line and a $35 million reduction in the golf mortgage product line. These net reductions were primarily due to the resolution of several significant accounts through the repossession of collateral, restructure of finance receivables and cash collections, partially offset by new finance receivables identified as nonaccrual in 2010. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the nonaccrual finance receivables by product line, along with a summary of finance receivables held for investment based on our internally assigned credit quality indicators.  

The percentage of contractual delinquency increased primarily due to one significant revolving notes receivable loan in the timeshare product line, which has been classified as nonaccrual since 2009 but was not contractually past due until the borrowers bankruptcy filing in 2010, partially offset by a reduction in delinquencies in the aviation and golf mortgage product lines, primarily resulting from the repossession and foreclosure of collateral. In the timeshare product line, revolving notes receivable loans often remain contractually current despite significant uncertainty regarding the eventual collection of full principal and interest because we are entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the underlying consumer notes receivable, which serve as the collateral for our loan. See page 54 in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of delinquencies by aging category.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron Inc. consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Cessna, Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments. The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of TFC, its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by Textron Inc. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage. We believe that with our existing cash balances, coupled with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the non-captive portion of the commercial finance business, and cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations, we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs.  

We maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. We also have credit line facilities available for the Manufacturing group of $1.25 billion and for the Finance group of $1.75 billion, which both expire in April 2012. At January 1, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding under the Manufacturing groups facility and $1.4 billion outstanding under the Finance groups facility.  

During 2010, we liquidated $2.4 billion of the Finance groups finance receivables, net of originations. These finance receivable reductions occurred in both the non-captive and captive finance portfolios but were primarily driven by the non-captive portfolio in connection with our exit plan, including $956 million in the distribution finance product line and $408 million in the timeshare product line. These reductions resulted from the combination of scheduled finance receivable collections, sales, discounted payoffs, repossession of collateral, charge-offs and impairment charges recorded as portfolio losses, net of gains in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, the reduction in finance receivables included $620 million in the captive finance portfolio, primarily as a result of reduced loan and lease originations and the sale of $84 million of finance receivables. We measure the success of the exit plan based on the percentage of total finance receivable and other finance asset reductions converted to cash. In 2010, we had a cash conversion ratio of 93%, compared with 95% in 2009, on our non-captive finance receivables. We expect the cash conversion ratio to continue to decline over the duration of the exit plan due to the change in mix from shorter term assets in the distribution finance product line to longer term assets in the timeshare, golf mortgage and structured finance product lines and the existence of a higher concentration of nonaccrual finance receivables. At the end of 2010, $2.3 billion of finance receivables remained in the non-captive portfolio.  

On May 5, 2009, we issued $600 million of 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes with a maturity date of May 1, 2013 as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2010, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price set forth for these Convertible Notes of $17.06 per share. Accordingly, the notes are convertible at the holders option through March 31, 2011. We may deliver shares of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We intend to settle the face value of the Convertible Notes in cash. We have continued to classify these Convertible Notes as long term based on our intent and ability to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year through the use of various funding sources available to us.

Manufacturing Group Cash Flows  

Cash flows from continuing operations for the Manufacturing group as presented in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In the aggregate, cash flow from operating activities in 2010 was comparable with 2009; however, our earnings for the Manufacturing group, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, were stronger in 2010 and totaled $941 million, compared with similarly adjusted earnings in 2009 of $701 million. The cash inflow from higher earnings was offset by a $350 million voluntary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is included in the Accrued and other liabilities line on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We also used less cash for restructuring activities in 2010, compared with 2009, with cash payments of $58 million, $132 million and $3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

In 2009, cash flow from operating activities increased $331 million, compared with 2008, largely due to $562 million in lower capital contributions paid to the Finance group, net of dividends received, and working capital improvements, partially offset by lower earnings. In 2008, cash flow from operating activities included a $625 million capital contribution to the Finance group as discussed below. Our use of working capital improved significantly in 2009, largely related to significant inventory reductions.  

Investing cash flows in 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily included capital expenditures of $270 million, $238 million and $537 million, respectively. The decrease in 2009 is largely due to a reduction in discretionary spending due to the economic recession. In addition, the increase in investing activities in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to three acquisitions in the Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments for $57 million. In 2008, we paid $109 million for acquisitions, primarily due to transaction settlements related to AAI, which was acquired at the end of 2007.  

Financing cash flows in 2010 primarily consist of the $1.2 billion repayment of the Manufacturing groups bank line of credit. In 2009, financing activities provided more cash than in 2008, primarily due to the draw of our $1.2 billion bank line of credit, a portion of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings, net proceeds of $442 million from the issuance of the Convertible Notes (net of call options), $333 million in cash from the issuance of our common stock and common stock warrants, $595 million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in dividends paid. These increases in cash provided in 2009 were partially offset by an $869 million decrease in commercial paper borrowings in 2009, compared with an $867 million increase in these borrowings in 2008. In addition, we made $412 million in payments to settle advances against our company-owned officer life insurance policies in 2009, while in 2008 we received $222 million in advances against these policies.  

Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $22 million, $21 million and $284 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in 2009 from 2008 payments was due to a reduction in the annual per share dividend to $0.08 in 2009 from $0.92 in 2008. We have not repurchased any of our common stock (other than in connection with an executive compensation award) since we suspended all share repurchase activity under our repurchase program in September 2008. Under Board-authorized share repurchase programs, we spent $533 million in 2008 for share repurchases representing approximately 12 million shares of common stock.  

Capital Contributions Paid To and Dividends Received From the Finance Group  

Under a Support Agreement between Textron Inc. and TFC, Textron Inc. is required to maintain a controlling interest in TFC. The agreement also requires Textron Inc. to ensure that TFC maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than $200 million. Cash contributions paid to TFC to maintain compliance with the Support Agreement and dividends paid by TFC to Textron Inc. are detailed below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

An additional cash contribution of $63 million was paid to TFC on January 11, 2011 as required by the Support Agreement.  

Due to the nature of these contributions, we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the Manufacturing group in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Capital contributions to support Finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities. The Finance groups net income (loss) is excluded from the Manufacturing groups cash flows, while dividends from the Finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the Manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment.

Finance Group Cash Flows

 The cash flows from continuing operations for the Finance group are summarized below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Cash flow from operating activities for the Finance group decreased $231 million in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to $103 million in taxes paid, primarily attributable to a settlement related to the challenge of tax deductions we took in prior years for certain leverage lease transactions. In 2009, the Finance group received a tax refund of $75 million, compared with tax payments of $52 million in 2008, which was partially offset by lower fee income in 2010 due to the wind-down of the non-captive business.  

Cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations, which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities in 2010 and in 2009. Finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled $3.0 billion in 2010, $5.4 billion in 2009 and $11.9 billion in 2008. Cash outflows for originations declined to $0.9 billion in 2010 from $3.7 billion in 2009 and $11.9 billion in 2008.  

In 2010, the Finance group used cash for financing activities primarily for repayments of long-term debt of $2.4 billion and for dividends paid to Textron Inc., partially offset by capital contributions received in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the Support Agreement. In 2009, the Finance group used more cash for financing activities, compared with 2008, primarily due to the repayment of debt and commercial paper in 2009, totaling $4.5 billion, compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. The Finance groups financing outflows were partially offset by $1.7 billion in proceeds from the first quarter 2009 drawdown on its bank line of credit. In 2008, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt totaled $1.5 billion.  

TFC borrowed funds from Textron Inc. in 2010 and in 2009, with interest, to pay down maturing debt. As of January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, the outstanding balance due to Textron Inc. for these borrowings was $315 million and $413 million, respectively.  

Consolidated Cash Flows  

The consolidated cash flows from continuing operations, after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups, are summarized below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Our earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and provision for losses, were stronger in 2010 and totaled $945 million, compared with similarly adjusted earnings in 2009 of $711 million. These higher earnings were offset by a $350 million voluntary contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of 2010. We also used less cash for restructuring activities in 2010, compared with 2009, with cash payments of $72 million, $144 million and $7 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  

Cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations, which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities in 2010 and 2009. Finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled $2.2 billion in 2010, $4.6 billion in 2009 and $11.1 billion in 2008. Cash outflows for originations declined to $450 million in 2010 from $3.0 billion in 2009 and $10.9 billion in 2008.  

Financing cash flows in 2010 primarily consisted of the $1.2 billion repayment of Textron Inc.s bank line of credit and a $300 million payment made on the outstanding balance of the TFCs bank line of credit. In addition, we made $2.2 billion in principal payments on our long-term debt in 2010.  

In 2009, more cash was used for financing activities as we repaid $4.2 billion in maturing long-term debt, including early debt extinguishments, compared with $1.9 billion in 2008. This use was partially offset by the receipt of $3.0 billion from drawing on our lines of credit, which was partially offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in commercial paper borrowings in 2009, compared with a $218 million increase in net commercial paper borrowings in 2008. We also made $412 million in payments to settle advances against our company-owned officer life insurance policies in 2009, while in 2008, we received $222 million in advances against these policies. In addition, we used more cash in 2008 for stock repurchases and dividend payments, compared with 2009, as discussed in the Manufacturing Group Cash Flows section herein.

Captive Financing and Other Intercompany Transactions  

The Finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the Finance groups statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing groups statement of cash flows, the cash received from the Finance group on the customers behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2010 and 2009, captive finance receivable originations have decreased largely due to lower aircraft sales.  

Consolidated Discontinued Operations Cash Flows

 The cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In 2009, cash flows from investing activities primarily include approximately $280 million in after-tax net proceeds upon the sale of HR Textron, partially offset by $69 million in tax payments related to the sale of the Fluid & Power business. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the Fluid & Power business of approximately $479 million. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning these dispositions.  

Contractual Obligations  

Manufacturing Group  

The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Manufacturing group as of January 1, 2011, as well as an estimate of the year in which these obligations are expected to be paid: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

31    

We maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. Our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table. In 2011, we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $200 million and approximately $30 million in the Retirement Account Plan. Based on our current assumptions, which may change with changes in market conditions, our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2012 through 2015 are estimated to be in the range of approximately $100 million to $400 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.  

Other long-term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011, representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. The timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. Other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.  

Operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases. Purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of January 1, 2011. The ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts, the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the U.S. Government under normal termination clauses.  

Finance Group  

The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Finance group as of January 1, 2011, as well as an estimate of the year in which these obligations are expected to be paid:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

   *   Securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the Finance group, and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests.  

   **   Interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt. They do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates, which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt.    

On January 1, 2011, the Finance group also had $257 million in other liabilities, primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses, that are payable within the next 12 months.  

Critical Accounting Estimates  

To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes other significant accounting policies.  

Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables Held for Investment  

Finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses. We maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on managements evaluation and analysis by product line. For larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired, including large accounts in homogenous portfolios, a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value to either a) the expected future cash flows, discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate; or b) the fair value, if the finance receivable is collateral dependent. The expected future cash flows consider collateral value; financial performance and liquidity of our borrower; 

32    

existence and strength of guarantors; estimated recovery costs, including legal expenses; and costs associated with the repossession/foreclosure and eventual disposal of collateral. When there is a range of potential outcomes, we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence.  

The evaluation of our portfolios is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral, which may differ from actual results. While our analysis is specific to each individual account, certain critical factors are included in this analysis for each product line, which are discussed in detail in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also establish an allowance for losses by product line to cover probable, but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio. For homogenous portfolios, including the aviation and golf equipment product lines, the allowance is established as a percentage of non-recourse finance receivables, which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves. The percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience, current delinquency and default trends, collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends. For non-homogenous portfolios, including the golf mortgage and timeshare product lines, the allowance is established as a percentage of watchlist balances, which represents a combination of assumed default likelihood and loss severity based on historical experience, industry trends and collateral values. We classify accounts as watchlist based on credit quality indicators discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In 2010 and 2009, net charge-offs totaled $138 million and $115 million, respectively, compared with the provision for losses recorded during the periods of $143 million and $267 million, respectively.  

Finance Receivables  

Finance receivables are classified as held for investment when we have the intent and the ability to hold the receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. Our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, contractual duration, type of collateral, credit strength of the borrowers, interest rates and perceived marketability of the receivables. On an ongoing basis, these factors, combined with our overall liquidation strategy, determine which finance receivables we have the intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale. Our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value and/or marketability of our finance receivables. A change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables. As a result of the significant influence of economic and liquidity conditions on our business plans and strategies, and the rapid changes in these and other factors we utilize to determine which assets are classified as held for sale, we currently believe the term foreseeable future represents a time period of six to nine months. We also believe that unanticipated changes in both internal and external factors affecting our financial performance, liquidity position or the value and/or marketability of our finance receivables could result in a modification of this assessment. 

If we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future, until maturity or payoff, the finance receivables are reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time. Conversely, if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity, these receivables would be designated as held for sale, and a valuation allowance would be established at that time, if necessary. At January 1, 2011, if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale, a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements. See page 65 in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities that currently are not recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. There are no active, quoted market prices for our finance receivables. The estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction, which includes both the sale of pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans. The models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return, financing cost, capital structure and/or discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses, payment rates and credit line utilization rates. Where available, the assumptions related to the expectations of current market participants are compared with observable market inputs, including bids from prospective purchasers of similar loans and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality. Although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models, these inputs are not typically derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures, industries and collateral types. Therefore, all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment, which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants.  

Long-Term Contracts  

We make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long-term contracts. These contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed-price purchase options for additional products. We account for these long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases, 

33    

includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years. We are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries.  

Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.  

Goodwill  

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment using a two-step process. In Step 1, companies are required to estimate fair value of their reporting units, which may be done using various methodologies, including the income method using discounted cash flows. If its estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit is not impaired, and no further analysis is performed. Otherwise, the amount of the impairment must be determined in Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. In Step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

Fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the units short- and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates, which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, current cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. The revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. The long-term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. We utilize a weighted-average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.  

Based on our annual review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the Step 1 impairment test in the foreseeable future.  

Retirement Benefits  

We maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases. We evaluate and update these assumptions annually. 

To determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2010, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 8.26%, compared with 8.58% in 2009. In 2010 and 2009, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 90% of our total pension assets, was 8.50% and 8.75%, respectively. A 50-basis-point decrease in this long-term rate of return in 2010 would have resulted in approximately a $22 million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans.  

The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed  

34    

income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In 2010, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 6.20%, compared with 6.61% in 2009. For our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 6.25% in 2010, compared with 6.57% for 2009. A 50-basis-point decrease in this discount rate in 2010 would have resulted in approximate a $25 million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans.  

The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2010 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. The 2010 medical rate of 8% is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2020 and then remain at that level. The 2010 prescription drug rate of 9% is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2020 and then remain at that level. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of a one-percentage-point change in the cost trend rate.  

Warranty Liabilities  

We provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs, including parts and labor, for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years. A significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses. We also may incur costs related to product recalls. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold, historical costs per claim, contractual recoveries from vendors, and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, including production and warranty patterns for new models. During our initial aircraft model launches, we typically incur higher warranty-related costs until the production process matures, at which point warranty costs moderate. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant. Should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience, we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required. 

Income Taxes  

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years, available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. We recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense. 

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Interest and penalties are accrued, where applicable. We recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense. If we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.
