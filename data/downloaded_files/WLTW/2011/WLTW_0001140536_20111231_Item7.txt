 This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the headings Executive Summary, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Critical Accounting Estimates and Contractual Obligations. Please see Forward-Looking Statements for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.  

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

 Business Overview  

 We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International.  

 Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries and activities including Aerospace; Energy; Marine; Construction; Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance.  

 North America and International comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and large corporations and the employee benefits practice, our largest product-based practice group, provides health, welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services.  

 In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.  

 We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.  

 Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a soft or softening market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A hard or firming market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.  

 Market Conditions  

 The years 2005 through 2010 were almost universally viewed as soft market years across most of our product offerings and our commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period were negatively impacted, although in 2009 the market experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and certain specialty markets.  

 Our North America and UK and Irish retail operations were particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic regions. This resulted in declines in revenues in these operations, particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn.  

 In 2011, we saw some modest increases in catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the New Zealand earthquake, the

 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 mid-west US tornadoes and Thailand floods. However, in general, we continued to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance market and challenging economic conditions across other sectors and most geographic regions.  

 We believe that, in the absence of a significant catastrophe loss or capital impairment in the industry, a universal turn in market rates is not likely to occur. However, more recently we have not seen the same reduction in rates globally that were faced in early 2011 and during 2010 and 2009. There have been recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines such as property catastrophe and workers compensation is slowly firming rates in those lines. Additionally, there has been some evidence of firming or hardening in certain sectors of the reinsurance market in early 2012.  

 Financial Performance  

 General  

 This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, organic growth in commissions and fees, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Companys operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. Organic growth in commissions and fees excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals, year over year movements in foreign exchange, legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition, and investment and other income from growth in revenues and commissions and fees. Adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain specified items from net income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011.  

 Consolidated Financial Performance  

 2011 compared to 2010  

 Despite difficult market conditions, total revenues in 2011 of $3,447 million increased by $115 million, or 3%, compared to 2010. This included organic growth in commissions and fees of 2% driven by our International and Global operations. Our North America operations reported a revenue decline of 4%, including a 4% decline in organic commissions and fees reflecting lower revenues generated by Loan Protector, a specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business, and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the US.  

 Total expenses in 2011 of $2,881 million increased $302 million compared to 2010, primarily due to incremental expense relating to the 2011 Operational Review (discussed later in this section), a $22 million write-off of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to January 1, 2011, also discussed later in this section, continued investment to support future growth, increased incentives amortization relating to our cash retention awards, reinstatement of salary reviews for all associates in March 2011 and 401(k) matching contributions for our US associates from January 2011, unfavorable foreign currency translation and an $11 million UK FSA regulatory settlement. These increases were partially offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, reduced pension expense of $24 million and the year-on-year $8 million benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities.  

 Net income attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing operations was $203 million or $1.15 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $455 million or $2.66 per diluted share in 2010. The $252 million reduction in net income compared to 2010 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the $131 million post-tax cost relating to the make-whole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of $500 million of our senior debt and the write-off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, partly offset by revenue growth achieved during the year. Net income was also adversely impacted by an $11 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate, Gras Savoye.

 Business discussion   

 2010 compared to 2009  

 Total revenues in 2010 of $3,332 million increased by $79 million, or 2%, compared to 2009, reflecting organic growth in commissions and fees of 4% being partly offset by a 1% adverse impact from foreign currency translation and decreased investment and other income. Total expenses in 2010 of $2,579 million, were $16 million higher compared to 2009. Salaries and benefits expense increased by $46 million, primarily due to a $60 million increase in incentive expense, partly offset by reduced severance costs and favorable foreign currency translation. Other operating expenses declined by $26 million, driven by reduced losses on our forward hedging program and a reduction in the amortization of intangible assets of $18 million due to a lower amortization charge for HRH-related intangibles.  

 Net income attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing operations was $455 million or $2.66 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $434 million or $2.57 per diluted share in 2009. The $21 million increase in net income compared to 2009 primarily reflects the revenue growth described above, partly offset by the $16 million increase in total expenses, an increase in the effective tax rate from 18% in 2009 to 24% in 2010 and a $10 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates, net of tax following the December 2009 reduction from 49% to 31% in our ownership interest in Gras Savoye.  

 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations  

 Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items from operating income and net income from continuing operations respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We believe that excluding these items, as applicable, from operating income and net income from continuing operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations. We use these and other measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations. The Company also uses both adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted operating margin measures to form the basis of establishing and assessing components of compensation. As set out in the tables below, adjusted operating margin at 22.5% in 2011, was down 50 basis points compared to 2010, while adjusted net income from continuing operations at $482 million was $12 million higher than in 2010 and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.74 in 2011, compared to $2.75 in 2010.  

 A reconciliation of adjusted operating income to reported operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Charge relating to the 2011 operational review, including $98 million of severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 1,200 positions for the full year 2011.   

  (b)   Regulatory settlement with the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA).

  (c)   With effect from January 1, 2010 the Venezuelan economy was designated as hyper-inflationary. The Venezuelan government also devalued the Bolivar Fuerte in January 2010. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded a one-time charge in other operating expenses to reflect the re-measurement of its net assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte.   

  (d)   Write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to January 1, 2011, see Correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods, below.

  (b)   Regulatory settlement with the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA).   

  (c)   Write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to January 1, 2011, see Correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods, below.   

  (d)   With effect from January 1, 2010 the Venezuelan economy was designated as hyper-inflationary. The Venezuelan government also devalued the Bolivar Fuerte in January 2010. As a result of these actions the Company recorded a one-time charge in other operating expenses to reflect the re-measurement of its net assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte.    

 2011 Operational review  

 In order to fund the higher anticipated salaries and benefits expense and continued investment for the future, we implemented a review of all our businesses in 2011 to better align our resources with our growth strategies. In connection with this review, we incurred pre-tax charges of $180 million in 2011 including:  

     $98 million of severance costs (including $9 million relating to the waiver of retention awards) relating to approximately 1,200 positions which have been, or are in the process of being, eliminated;   

     $37 million of other salaries and benefits expense to buy out previously existing incentive schemes and other contractual arrangements that no longer align with the Groups overall remuneration strategy; and   

     $45 million of other operating expenses, including: property and systems rationalization costs; related accelerated systems depreciation of $5 million; and re-negotiation of sourcing contracts.     

 32    
 Business discussion   

 The full year cost of the 2011 Operational Review at $180 million represents an increase of $20 million from our third quarter 2011 estimate. This is the result of the identification of additional opportunities to achieve efficiencies.  

 In 2011 we realized total cost savings attributable to the 2011 Operational Review of approximately $80 million. We now expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately $135 million beginning in 2012, an increase from our previous estimate of $115 million to $125 million, and represents incremental savings in 2012 compared to 2011 of approximately $55 million.  

 The statements under 2011 Operational Review constitute forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.  

 Make-whole on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs  

 We issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011, comprised of $300 million 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and $500 million 5.750% senior notes due 2021. Net proceeds of approximately $787 million were used in part to repurchase and redeem $500 million 12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million. In addition to the make-whole payment we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.  

 Correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods  

 In the first quarter of 2012, we identified through our internal financial control process an uncollectible accounts receivable balance of approximately $28 million in a stand-alone business unit that appears to be due to fraudulent overstatements of Commissions and Fees from the years 2005 to 2011. This matter was brought to managements attention after we had announced our fourth quarter and annual earnings on February 14, 2012.  

 The Company is conducting an internal investigation into this matter with the assistance of our professional advisors. Based on the results of the investigation to date, we believe that the overstatements resulted from the conduct of a few associates within or dealing with our Employee Benefits group who colluded to misapply certain current cash receipts to older outstanding accounts receivable balances. We have concluded that the overstatements we uncovered did not materially affect our previously-issued financial statements for any of the prior periods.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2011, we have corrected the misstatement of Commissions and Fees from prior periods by recognizing a $22 million charge to Other Operating Expenses to write off the uncollectible receivable at January 1, 2011, and by reversing the $6 million balance of Commissions and Fees which had been recorded during 2011. We have also reversed $2 million of Salaries and Benefits representing an over-accrual of production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue. As a result of correcting these misstatements, our financial statements for 2011 differ in certain immaterial respects, including a net $0.01 reduction in adjusted earnings per diluted share, from the unaudited financial statements included in our press release issued on February 14, 2012.  

 The associates in question, who have been placed on administrative leave pending completion of the investigation, have not been members of Willis executive management or played a significant role in internal control over financial reporting. Based on the results of our investigation to date, we do not believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or that any other business units were affected.  

 We have taken steps to enhance our internal controls in relation to the business unit in question, including enhanced procedures over handling of cash receipts, increased segregation of duties between the operating unit and the accounting and settlement function, and additional central sign off on revenue recognition.

 Cash retention awards  

 We started making cash retention awards in 2005 to a small number of employees. With the success of the program, we expanded it over time to include more staff and we believe it is a contributing factor to the reduction in employee turnover we have seen in recent years.  

 Salaries and benefits do not reflect the unamortized portion of annual cash retention awards made to employees. Employees must repay a proportionate amount of these cash retention awards if they voluntarily leave our employ (other than in the event of retirement or permanent disability) within a certain time period, currently three years. We make cash payments to our employees in the year we grant these retention awards and recognize these payments ratably over the period they are subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the award is made.  

 During 2011, we made $210 million of cash retention award payments compared with $196 million in 2010 and $148 million in 2009. Salaries and benefits in 2011 include $185 million of amortization of cash retention award payments made on or before December 31, 2011, compared with $119 million in 2010 and $88 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we included $196 million, $173 million and $98 million, respectively, within other current assets and other non-current assets on the balance sheet, which represented the unamortized portion of cash retention award payments made on or before those dates.  

 Pension Expense  

 We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined benefit pension plans in 2011 of $6 million, and $nil respectively, compared with $28 million and $1 million respectively in 2010 and $25 million and $7 million respectively in 2009. On our international defined benefit pension plans, we recorded a net pension charge of $5 million in 2011, compared with $6 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009.  

 The UK plan charge was $22 million lower compared to 2010 as the benefits of higher asset returns, lower amortization of prior period losses and a lower service cost reflecting certain changes to plan benefits were partly offset by an increased interest cost. The UK pension charge was $3 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as the benefit from higher asset returns was more than offset by a higher service cost, higher amortization of prior period losses and higher interest cost.  

 The US pension charge was $1 million lower in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting an increased asset return from a higher asset base partly offset by a reduction in amortization of prior period losses. The US pension charge was $6 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increased asset return, a reduction in the amortization of prior period losses and the first full years benefit from closing the scheme to future accrual in May 2009, partly offset by the non-recurrence of a $12 million curtailment gain in 2009.  

 See Contractual Obligations below for further information on our obligations relating to our pension plans.  

 Acquisitions and Disposals  

 During first quarter 2011, we acquired a 23% interest in a South African brokerage at a total cost of $2 million. During third quarter 2011, we acquired a 100% interest in a Polish brokerage, Brokerskie Centrum Ubezpieczeniowe, at a total cost of $2 million. In the fourth quarter 2011, we acquired 100% of Broking Italia, a Rome-based employee benefits broker at a total cost of $12 million.  

 During 2010, we acquired an additional 39% of our Chinese operations at a total cost of approximately $17 million, bringing our ownership to 90% and an additional 15% of our Colombian operations at a total cost of approximately $7 million, bringing our ownership to 80% at December 31, 2010.  

 On December 31, 2011, we disposed of Global Special Risks, LLC, Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets of Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc. We have recorded within Discontinued Operations, net income of $1 million in 2011

 Consolidated Results for 2011 compared to 2010  

 Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented; (iv) in North America, legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition that had not been converted into higher standard commission; and (v) investment income and other income from reported revenues.   

  (b)   Included in North America reported commissions and fees were legacy HRH contingent commissions of $5 million in 2011 compared with $11 million in 2010.   

  (c)   Reported commissions and fees and organic commissions and fees growth for Global for 2011 included a 2011 favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a Global Specialty business of $6 million.   

  (d)   Reported commissions and fees included a favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a specialty business in North America of $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.   

     Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.    

 Revenue increased by $115 million, or 3%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Commissions and fees increased by $121 million or 4%, including organic growth in commissions and fees of 2%, which comprised 4% net new business growth driven by solid new business generation and higher retention of existing clients, and a 2% negative impact from renewal fluctuations and other market factors.  

 There was a net 2% year-over-year benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation driven by the weakening of the US dollar against a number of currencies in which we earn our revenues.  

 The 2% growth in organic commissions and fees comprised net growth in our operating segments:  

     Global achieved 7% growth, including growth in our Reinsurance, Global Specialties and Willis Faber and Dumas (formerly London Market Wholesale) businesses, together with a $6 million 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy;   

     International achieved 5% organic growth driven primarily by our Latin America and Eastern Europe regions; and   

     North America reported a 4% decline in organic commissions and fees, primarily driven by the revenue decline in Loan Protector (a small specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business that works with financial institutions to confirm their loans are properly insured and interests are adequately protected). Excluding Loan Protector, the North America segment recorded a 2% decline in organic commissions and fees as the benefit of new business generation was more than offset by a 1% decline in client retention levels, the continued negative impact of the soft market and ongoing weakened economic conditions in the US.    

 Investment income in 2011 at $31 million was $7 million lower than in 2010, as low interest rates across the globe, in particular in the UK and US, together with the roll-off of our interest rate hedge program continued to impact our investment income.   

 37    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in Operating Results  Segment Information, below.  

 Salaries and Benefits  

 Salaries and benefits increased $219 million, or 12% in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily reflecting additional expense in 2011 of $135 million associated with our 2011 Operational Review, a $66 million increase from the amortization of cash retention awards and the year-on-year net adverse impact from foreign currency translation, driven primarily by the movement of the US dollar against the Pound sterling (in which our London Market based operations incur the majority of their expenses). Furthermore, we incurred an additional $10 million expense relating to the reinstatement of our 401(k) match plan for our North America employees from January 2011 and incremental expense following reinstatement of annual salary reviews for all employees from April 2011. These increases were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, reduced payments of non-retentive incentives and a $24 million decrease in pension expense driven by a higher return on assets and lower amortization of prior period gains and losses.  

 Other Expenses  

 Other operating expenses were $92 million, or 16%, higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily reflecting $40 million of additional expense associated with the 2011 Operational Review, a $22 million write-off of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to January 1, 2011, and discussed earlier in this section, the $11 million second quarter UK FSA regulatory settlement and increased expense in support of revenue growth initiatives. These were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, the year-over-year favorable comparison due to the $12 million 2010 charge relating to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the $8 million year-over-year benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities and positive year-over-year foreign currency translation, driven primarily by gains in 2011 on our forward rate hedging program, compared to losses in 2010.  

 Depreciation expense was $74 million in 2011, compared with $63 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects accelerated depreciation expense of $5 million in 2011 relating to systems rationalization in connection with the 2011 Operational Review and depreciation of newly capitalized systems project costs in 2011.  

 Amortization of intangible assets was $68 million in 2011, a reduction of $14 million compared to 2010. The decrease primarily reflects the year-over-year benefit of the 2010 amortization of the HRH non-compete agreement acquired in 2008, which was fully amortized in 2010.  

 Make-whole on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs  

 As described above, we issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011 and net proceeds of approximately $787 million were used to repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million. In addition to the make-whole payment we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense was $156 million in 2011, a reduction of $10 million compared to 2010. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the lower coupon payable on our new debt issued in March 2011, the period-over-period decrease in the outstanding balance on our 5-year term loan facility and net gains recognized on our forward rate hedging program. These benefits were partially offset by the $10 million fourth quarter expense relating to the write-off of debt issuance costs following the refinancing of our bank facility.   

 38    
 Business discussion   

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2011 was 24%, compared with 26% for 2010, with the reduction driven primarily by the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 Operational Review are relieved and a different geographic mix of business. The effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items. The significant discrete items occurring in 2011 are:  

     tax related to the make-whole payment on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs which are relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;   

     the net impact of gains and losses on disposals recorded in continuing operations;   

     tax related to the write-off of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance which is relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;   

     the impact of the UK FSA regulatory settlement expense for which no tax relief is available;   

     the impact of the change in rate of UK corporate income tax being applied to the Companys opening temporary differences; and   

     adjustments made in respect of tax on profits of prior periods to bring in line the Companys tax provisions to filed tax positions.    

 Including the impact of discrete items, the effective tax rate was 13% in 2011 compared to 24% in 2010.  

 Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax  

 We own an interest in a number of associates, such as Gras Savoye, where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, was $12 million in 2011, compared with $23 million in 2010. The decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate, Gras Savoye, following recent refinancing actions taken by the company, ongoing restructuring activity and the negative impact on their results from adverse economic conditions in France and other parts of Europe.  

 Discontinued Operations, net of Tax  

 Net income from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to our fourth quarter disposal of Global Special Risks, LLC, Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets of Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc. We recorded net income from discontinued operations of $1 million in 2011, comprising a net loss for the year of $1 million offset by the benefit of a $2 million net gain on disposal.

  (b)   Included in North America reported commissions and fees were legacy HRH contingent commissions of $11 million in 2010, compared with $27 million in 2009.   

  (c)   Reported commissions and fees included a favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a specialty business in North America of $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.   

     Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.    

 Revenue increased $79 million, or 2%, in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting organic growth in commissions and fees of 4%, offset by a 1% adverse impact from foreign currency translation and decreased investment and other income. Our Global segment achieved 7% organic growth in commission and fees and the International segment achieved 5% growth. North America organic commissions and fees growth was flat with the positive benefit from strong growth in our specialty businesses, driven by good business growth, together with a $7 million increase in commissions and fees from a change in accounting in an acquired specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy, 3% growth in our employee benefits practice, good net new business generation and improved client retention, offset by the impact of the continued soft market and ongoing weakened economic conditions.  

 Investment income was $12 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 with the impact of lower interest rates across the globe, particularly on our Euro-denominated deposits, partially mitigated by our forward hedging program.  

 Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in Operating Results  Segment Information below.  

 Salaries and Benefits  

 Salaries and benefits increased by $46 million, or 3% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a $60 million increase in incentive expenses, comprising a $31 million increase in the amortization of cash retention awards and a $29 million increase in the accrual for non-retentive incentive compensation due to increased headcount and improved performance across many regions. The increase in incentive expense was partially offset by reduced severance costs in 2010 and favorable foreign currency translation, primarily the year-on-year strengthening of the US dollar against the Pound Sterling.

 Business discussion   

 Other Expenses  

 Other operating expenses declined by $26 million in 2010 compared to 2009 as the benefit from $25 million of lower losses on our forward hedging program, the release of a $7 million previously established legal reserve and continued disciplined management of discretionary expenses were partially offset by a $12 million first quarter 2010 charge relating to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and expense increases in support of revenue growth initiatives.  

 Amortization of intangible assets declined by $18 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the declining charge for the HRH customer relationship intangible and the year-on-year benefit from a $7 million accelerated amortization in 2009 relating to the HRH brand name.  

 Net gain (loss) on disposal of operations declined by $15 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the recording in 2009 of a $10 million gain on sale following the part-disposal of the Groups holding in Gras Savoye.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense in 2010 was $8 million lower than in 2009, as interest expense savings arising from the reduction in average term loan and revolving credit facility balances was partly offset by the effect of the higher coupon payable on the $500 million 12.875% senior unsecured notes issued in March 2009.  

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate was 24% for 2010 compared to 18% in 2009 as a $22 million benefit in 2010 from prior year tax adjustments was more than offset by the adverse impact from the $12 million charge relating to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency for which no tax credits are available and positive impacts on the 2009 effective tax rate from a $27 million release relating to a 2009 change in tax law and an $11 million release relating to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate of 26% on ordinary income for 2010 was broadly in line with 2009.  

 Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax  

 Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in 2010 of $23 million was $10 million lower than in 2009, primarily due to the reduction from 49% to 31% in our ownership interest in Gras Savoye, as part of the reorganization of their capital structure in December 2009. Interest receivable on the vendor financing we provided as part of the capital reorganization is recorded under this caption.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 Debt  

 Total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 41    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 In March 2011 we issued $800 million of new debt, comprised of $300 million 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and $500 million 5.750% senior notes due 2021. We received net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses of approximately $787 million, which were used largely in part to repurchase and redeem $500 million 12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million, which represented a slight discount to the make-whole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing this debt. In addition to the make-whole payments of $158 million, we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.  

 In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a new 5-year $300 million term loan and a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit facility. The $300 million term loan repaid the majority of the $328 million balance outstanding on our $700 million 5-year term loan facility and the $500 million revolving credit facility replaces our existing $300 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $10 million relating to these facilities were written off in December 2011 following completion of the refinancing. In 2011, we made $83 million of mandatory repayments against the 5-year term loan before repaying the $328 million balance in December 2011.  

 These refinancing actions have lengthened our debt maturity profile. At December 31, 2011, we have $nil outstanding under both the $500 million and the existing $20 million facility compared with December 31, 2010 when we had $90 million outstanding under our $300 million facility and $nil outstanding under our $200 million and $20 million facilities. At December 31, 2011 the only scheduled debt repayments falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled repayments on our new $300 million 5-year term loan totaling $11 million and repayment of the $4 million 6% loan notes due 2012.  

 Liquidity  

 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations and $520 million available under our revolving credit facilities, of which the $20 million UK facility is solely for use by our main regulated UK entity in certain exceptional circumstances. At December 31, 2011 we had $436 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $100 million is available for general corporate purposes.  

 As of December 31, 2011, our short-term liquidity requirements consisted of $125 million payment of interest on debt, $11 million of mandatory repayments under our 5-year term loan, a $4 million mandatory repayment of our 6.000% loan notes due 2012, $1 million of revolving credit facility commitment fees, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. In addition, our estimated pension contributions for 2012 are $142 million. Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of the principal amount of outstanding notes and borrowings under our 5-year term loan facility.  

 Based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.  

 Pensions  

 UK plan  

 In early 2012 we provisionally agreed a revised funding strategy with the UK plans trustee. Whilst the proposed new funding strategy has not been definitively agreed at the date of this report, we expect this to occur by the end of March 2012, and we expect the cash contributions to the scheme in 2012 to be approximately equal to those in 2011, of $92 million.  

 US plan  

 We will make cash contributions of approximately $40 million to the US plan in 2012, compared to contributions of $30 million in 2011. We also intend to make lump sum payments to specific classes of US plan members in settlement of    

 42    
 Business discussion   

 their pension obligations. Such payments will only be made in limited tranches. Whilst such payments will have a positive impact on the overall liabilities of the US plan they may require us to provide additional funding to the plan.  

 Summary consolidated cash flow information (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 This summary consolidated cash flow should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Companys consolidated financial statements.  

 Consolidated Cash Flow for 2011 compared to 2010  

 Operating Activities  

 Total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $439 million in 2011, compared with $489 million in 2010. The decrease of $50 million primarily reflects the $57 million year-on-year increase in accounts receivable, reflecting increased revenue but also slower collections in the US due to current economic conditions; cash outflows of approximately $120 million relating to the 2011 Operational Review; and the $24 million year-on-year increase in payments for cash retention awards. These were partly offset by realized cash savings resulting from the 2011 Operational Review and other working capital movements.  

 Investing Activities  

 Total net cash used in continuing investing activities was $101 million in 2011 compared to $94 million in 2010. The $101 million net outflow was mainly due to capital spend including fit-out of our Nashville office and IT project investments.  

 Financing Activities  

 Total net cash used in continuing financing activities was $214 million in 2011 compared to $293 million in 2010. We issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011 and net proceeds of approximately $787 million were used to repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior notes due 2016. As part of this debt refinancing we made a $158 million make-whole payment on the redemption of our 12.875% senior notes due 2016. Other significant financing activities in 2011 include refinancing our bank facility in December 2011, dividend payments of $180 million and receipt of $60 million from the issue of shares.

 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 Consolidated Cash Flow for 2010 compared to 2009  

 Operating Activities  

 Total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $489 million in 2010 compared with $419 million in 2009. The $70 million increase compared with 2009 primarily reflected the benefits of a $142 million increase in net income from continuing operations before non-cash items offset by a $48 million increase in pension scheme contributions, a $48 million increase in cash retention award payments, the timing of cash collections and other working capital movements.  

 Investing Activities  

 Total net cash outflow from continuing investing activities was $94 million in 2010 compared with a net cash inflow of $102 million in 2009. The 2010 outflow was primarily due to capital spend and $21 million of payments for acquisitions of subsidiaries, mainly in respect of prior year acquisitions. In 2009, capital spend of $96 million was offset by net receipts of $113 million from changes in our ownership interest in Gras Savoye, $42 million net proceeds from sale of discontinued operations, mainly attributable to the second quarter 2009 disposal of Bliss & Glennon and $21 million proceeds from the sale of short-term investments.  

 Financing Activities  

 Net cash used in continuing financing activities was $293 million in 2010 compared with $516 million in 2009. The net decrease in cash used in financing activities of $223 million was mainly attributable to a $90 million drawdown against the revolving credit facilities in 2010 and debt refinancing actions in 2009 that resulted in $102 million higher debt repayments net of debt issuance in that year.  

 Own funds  

 As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $436 million, compared with $316 million at December 31, 2010 and $520 million remained available to draw under our revolving credit facilities, compared with $430 million at December 31, 2010.  

 Fiduciary funds  

 As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Companys debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.  

 Share redemptions or repurchases  

 The Company is authorized to repurchase or redeem shares under a variety of methods and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. There remains approximately $922 million under the current authorization. The Company did not repurchase or redeem any shares in 2011 or 2010. In February 2012, the Company announced that in 2012 it intends to buyback up to $100 million of shares through open market or privately    

 44    
 Business discussion   

 negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. As at February 23, 2012 the Company acquired 75,000 shares at a total price of approximately $3 million.  

 Dividends  

 Cash dividends paid in 2011 were $180 million compared with $176 million in 2010 and $174 million in 2009, with the year-on-year increases due to increases in share count over each year.  

 In February 2012, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share, an annual rate of $1.08 per share, an increase of 3.8% over the prior 12 month period.  

 REVIEW OF SEGMENTAL RESULTS  

 We organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International. Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities. North America and International comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and major corporations.  

 The following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2011 (in millions except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Reported commissions and fees include a 2011 benefit of $6 million from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy.   

  (b)   Included in North America reported commissions and fees were legacy HRH contingent commissions of $5 million in 2011, $11 million in 2010 and $27 million in 2009.   

  (c)   Reported commissions and fees included a favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a specialty business in North America of $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.    

 Global  

 Our Global operations comprise Global Specialties, Reinsurance, Willis Faber & Dumas (formerly London Market Wholesale), and as of 2010, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory (WCMA). From January 1, 2011, Willis Faber & Dumas also includes our Global Markets International unit. We have retrospectively adjusted our segmental information disclosures within this discussion to reflect this change to our reporting structure.

 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended December 31, 2011 (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Reported commissions and fees include a $6 million first quarter 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy.    

 2011 compared to 2010  

 Revenues  

 Commissions and fees of $1,073 million were $86 million, or 9%, higher in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of 7% and a net benefit from foreign currency translation of 2%. Organic growth included the benefit of net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the continued difficult economic environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes.  

 Organic growth included positive growth across Reinsurance, Global Specialties, Willis Faber & Dumas and WCMA businesses, together with a $6 million first quarter 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy.  

 Organic growth in Reinsurance in 2011 was led by growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, and included the benefit of new business growth and a profitability initiative that may or may not recur. Overall Reinsurance showed stable pricing with modest increases in some lines and geographies, particularly those affected by catastrophe losses.  

 Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong contributions from Marine, Energy, Financial Solutions and Aerospace, reflecting good new business, high retention levels, targeted hiring of producer talent and connectivity between the retail network and specialty businesses. However, the operating environment remains challenging across most Global Specialty businesses with depressed world trade and transit volumes, industry consolidation and pressure on financing of construction projects still evident.  

 Willis Faber & Dumas reported positive organic commissions and fees growth in 2011 and our WCMA business was marginally positive compared to 2010.  

 The 2% net benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the period-over-period positive impact of the weakening of the US dollar against both the Euro and Pound sterling, in which we earn a significant portion of Global revenues.  

 Productivity in Global, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to $386,000 for 2011 compared with $366,000 for 2010.  

 Client retention levels improved to 91% for 2011, compared with 90% for 2010.   

 46    
 Business discussion   

 Operating margin  

 Operating margin was 33% in 2011 compared to 32% in 2010 as the benefit of 7% organic commissions and fees growth discussed above and an $18 million decrease in pension expense was offset by a net negative impact from foreign currency movements, an $8 million increase in incentive expense, including amortization of cash retention award payments and the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth.  

 Operating margin is impacted by foreign exchange movements as the London market operations earn revenues in US dollars, Pounds sterling and Euros and primarily incur expenses in Pounds sterling. In addition, they are exposed to exchange risk on certain Pound sterling-denominated balances.  

 The period-over-period net negative impact from foreign currency movements in 2011 primarily reflected the increased US dollar value of our Pound sterling expense base as a result of the weakening of the US dollar versus the Pound sterling and the net negative impact of translation of non-USD assets and liabilities into US dollar in our London market operations. These factors were partially offset by the US dollar weakening against the Pound sterling and the Euro, increasing the US dollar value of our Pound and Euro denominated revenues.  

 2010 compared to 2009  

 Revenues  

 Commissions and fees were $66 million, or 7%, higher in 2010 compared with 2009 which was driven by 7% organic commissions and fees growth.  

 Our Reinsurance and Global Specialties businesses reported mid-single digit organic growth in 2010, driven by net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the difficult rate environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes.  

 Reinsurance reported strong new business growth in 2010 and client retention levels remained high. Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong contributions from Financial and Executive Risks, Construction and Energy, reflecting strong new business, improved retention, targeted hiring of producer talent and improved cooperation across the retail and specialty businesses.  

 Our WCMA business contributed to organic growth in 2010, substantially due to a $9 million fee on a single capital markets transaction in the second quarter.  

 Within Willis Faber & Dumas, revenues in Faber & Dumas were slightly lower than 2009, mainly reflecting the soft wholesale market, together with continued pressure on the most economically sensitive lines such as bloodstock, jewelry and fine arts.  

 Productivity in Global, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to $366,000 for 2010 compared with $352,000 for 2009.  

 Client retention levels remained high at 90% for 2010, in line with 2009.  

 Operating margin  

 Operating margin was 32% in 2010 compared with 33% in 2009. This decrease primarily reflected the adverse impact of foreign currency translation, as the positive effect on our Pound sterling expense base from the strengthening US dollar, was more than offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency movements on sterling-denominated balances.   

 47    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 Excluding the impact of this foreign currency translation, Globals operating margin remained flat as the benefits of good organic commissions and fees growth and disciplined cost control were offset by the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth.  

 North America  

 Our North America business provides risk management, insurance brokerage, related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the United States, Canada and as of January 1, 2011, Mexico retail. We have retrospectively adjusted our segmental information disclosures within this discussion to reflect the allocation of Mexico retail operations to our North America segment.  

 The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended December 31, 2011 (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Included in North America reported commissions and fees were legacy HRH contingent commissions of $5 million in 2011, compared with $11 million in 2010 and $27 million in 2009.   

  (b)   Reported commissions and fees included a favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a specialty business in North America of $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.    

 2011 compared to 2010  

 Revenues  

 Commissions and fees of $1,314 million were $55 million, or 4%, lower in 2011 compared with 2010 of which $6 million was attributable to the decrease in legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition from $11 million in 2010 to $5 million in 2011.  

 Organic commissions and fees growth declined 4% in 2011 compared with 2010, as the benefits of new business generation and growth in some regions were more than offset by declining Loan Protector revenues and the impact of the soft market conditions and weakened economy across most sectors.  

 The decline in the financial performance of our Loan Protector business had a 2% negative impact on North America organic growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011 negatively impacted the segments revenue by $27 million. The Loan Protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures in the US in 2011.  

 Following the introduction of health care reform legislation in 2010, some major health insurance carriers in North America began to change their compensation practices in particular lines of business in certain locations. In response to market pressures those changes caused, we announced in July 2011 that in order to remain competitive, we would begin accepting standard compensation based on volume, but would continue to resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments because, while legal, we believe these forms of compensation create conflicts with our clients. After    

 48    
 Business discussion   

 several months of review under changing market conditions, we have concluded that we cannot be fully competitive on Employee Benefits business if we continue to refuse these legal forms of compensation. Consequently, we will begin to accept all forms of compensation from Employee Benefits providers effective April 1, 2012 in North America.  

 Despite the decline in revenues, productivity in North America, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to $235,000 for 2011 compared with $234,000 for 2010.  

 Client retention levels were 91% in 2011 compared to 92% in 2010.  

 Operating margin  

 Operating margin in North America was 20% in 2011 compared with 23% in 2010, reflecting the adverse impact from the 4% decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above, a period-over-period increase in 401(k) match expense of $10 million following its reinstatement in January 2011 and a $7 million increase in incentive expense, including amortization of cash retention award payments. These were partly offset by a $5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and the benefit of cost reductions driven by the 2011 Operational Review and continued focus on expense management.  

 2010 compared to 2009  

 Revenues  

 Commissions and fees of $1,369 million were $12 million, or 1%, lower for 2010 compared with 2009. Excluding the $16 million decrease in legacy contingency commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition, there was a modest increase in commissions and fees.  

 Organic commissions and fees growth was flat for 2010. We experienced strong performance in our specialty businesses, driven by good business growth together with a $7 million increase in commissions and fees from a change in accounting of an acquired specialty business in North America to conform to Group accounting policy. Our employee benefits practice recorded 3% growth despite the soft labor market and we achieved good net new business generation, with improved client retention. This was offset by a negative 2% impact from rate declines and other market factors and a further decline in our Construction business and smaller declines elsewhere reflecting continued soft market conditions and the weak US economy.  

 Despite the small decline in revenues, productivity in North America, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to $234,000 for 2010 compared with $223,000 for 2009.  

 Client retention levels increased to 92% for 2010, compared with 91% for 2009.  

 Operating margin  

 Operating margin in North America was 23% in both 2010 and 2009, as the benefits of continued disciplined cost control and underlying lower pension expense in 2010 were offset by a $16 million reduction in legacy HRH contingent commissions, increased incentive expense, including the impact of increased amortization of cash retention award payments and the non-recurrence of a $9 million benefit in 2009 from the curtailment of the US pension plan relating to our North America retail employees.  

 International  

 Our International business comprises our retail operations in Eastern and Western Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Asia-Pacific, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America. The services provided are focused    

 49    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting.  

 The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended December 31, 2011(in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2011 compared to 2010  

 Revenues  

 Commissions and fees of $1,027 million were $90 million, or 10%, higher in 2011 compared with 2010, comprising 5% organic growth and a net 5% positive impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth included net new business growth of 7%, partly offset by the negative impact from rates and other market factors.  

 There were strong contributions to 2011 organic commissions and fees growth from most regions, including double-digit growth in our Latin America and Eastern Europe regions, together with single-digit growth in Asia and Western Europe. In particular, there was strong growth in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Russia and China.  

 The single-digit organic commissions and fees growth in our large retail operation in Continental Europe was primarily driven by strong growth in Italy, Spain and Germany, despite the ongoing challenging economic conditions in this region, offset by lower commissions and fees in Denmark and the Netherlands.  

 Organic commissions and fees growth in our UK and Ireland retail operations, declined 2% in 2011, compared with the same period 2010, driven by the economic pressures that continue to affect both the UK and Ireland.  

 A significant part of Internationals revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar, most notably the Euro, Pound sterling and Australian dollar. The net 5% benefit from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the weakening of the US dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn International revenues.  

 Productivity in our International business, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to $160,000 for 2011 compared with $150,000 for 2010.  

 Client retention levels increased to 94% for 2011, compared with 93% for 2010.  

 Operating margin  

 Operating margin in International was 21% in 2011, compared with 24% in 2010, with the decrease primarily reflecting a $17 million increase in incentive expenses including amortization of cash retention award payments, the impact of the reinstated annual salary review for all employees from April 2011 and increased spending on initiatives to drive future growth, including investment hires. These increases were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees growth and favorable foreign currency movements as discussed above and reduced pension expense.   

 50    
 Business discussion   

 2010 compared to 2009  

 Revenues  

 Commissions and fees of $937 million were $39 million, or 4%, higher for 2010 compared with 2009, as the benefits of 5% organic commissions and fees growth and 1% from the net effect of acquisitions and disposals were partly offset by a 2% adverse impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth included net new business growth of 8% and there was a negative 3% impact from rates and other market factors.  

 There were strong contributions to organic commissions and fees growth from most regions, led by growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Western Europe. There was further positive growth in our Eastern Europe operations, driven by a strong contribution from Russia. Organic commissions and fees growth was also positive in our UK and Irish retail operations, driven by new business growth in the UK. Our employee benefits practice, which represents approximately 10% of International commissions and fees, performed well in 2010 with growth in the mid single digits.  

 A significant part of Internationals revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar. The US dollar strengthened against a number of these currencies in 2010 compared with 2009, most notably the Euro, Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte, Danish Kroner and Pound Sterling. The adverse impact of this strengthening was partly offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the Australian dollar. The net impact of these movements was a 2% reduction in 2010 revenues compared to 2009.  

 Productivity in our International business, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to $150,000 for 2010 compared with $147,000 for 2009.  

 Client retention levels remained high at 93% for 2010.  

 Operating margin  

 Operating margin in International was 24% in both 2010 and 2009. Benefits from 5% organic commissions and fees growth and continued focus on disciplined expense management were offset by the adverse impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro and other currencies in which we earn a significant portion of our operating income, increased incentive expenses, including amortization of cash retention award payments, a reduction in investment income, driven by lower interest rates particularly in the Eurozone, and spending on initiatives to drive future growth.  

 Corporate & Other  

 The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on organic commissions and fees growth and operating income. For internal reporting and segmental reporting, items for which segmental management are not held responsible for are held within Corporate & Other.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

 Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance. Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.  

 Pension expense  

 We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the US and UK. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants and, with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New entrants in the UK are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. These international schemes have combined total assets of $128 million and a combined net liability for pension benefits of $3 million as of December 31, 2011. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.  

 We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined benefit pension plans in 2011 of $6 million, and $nil respectively, compared with $28 million and $1 million respectively in 2010. On our international defined benefit pension plans, we recorded a net pension charge of $5 million in 2011, compared with $6 million in 2010.  

 Based on December 31, 2011 assumptions, we expect the net pension charge in 2012 to decrease by $11 million for the UK plan, increase by $3 million for the US plan and increase a net $1 million for the international plans.  

 We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our UK and US pension plans is set out below.

  (b)   Assumes all plan participants are one year younger.    

 Discount rate  

 During 2011, we moved from an index based approach to determining the discount rate to a duration based approach which more closely matches the actual timings of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities was 4.80% compared with 5.45% at December 31, 2010 with the decrease reflecting a reduction in UK long-term bond rates in 2011. Under the old approach, the discount rate at the end of 2011 would have been 4.65%. We estimate the impact of this change was to:  

     increase the 2011 funded status by approximately $54 million; and   

     reduce the 2012 estimated pension expense by approximately $5 million.    

 The lower discount rate generated an actuarial loss of approximately $240 million at December 31, 2011.  

 Expected and actual asset returns  

 Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in 2011 was 7.50% (2010: 7.75%), equivalent to an expected return in 2011 of $161 million (2010: $141 million). The decrease in the expected long-term rate of return followed a change in the underlying target asset mix.  

 The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Mortality  

 During 2011, we amended the mortality assumptions to more closely align them to those used in the most recent funding valuation. The mortality assumption is now the 90 / 105% PNA00 table for males / females (2010: 100% PNA00 table without an age adjustment).  

 This change gave rise to an approximate $85 million increase in the 2011 projected benefit obligation compared to using the 2010 mortality assumptions.   

 53    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2011 would have a life expectancy of 24 years.  

 US plan  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Discount rate  

 The rate used to discount US plan liabilities at December 31, 2010 was 5.58%, determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve. Since the end of 2010, AA corporate bond spot yields have fallen and spreads of long term AA bonds over gilts have widened. Consequently, the discount rate at December 31, 2011 was 4.63%, a reduction of 95 basis points from 2010 year end. The impact of the lower discount rate in 2011 increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $100 million.  

 Expected and actual asset returns  

 The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net US pension scheme expense in 2011 was 7.50%, a reduction of 0.25% from 2010. Effective January 1, 2012, the expected long-term rate of return was further decreased to 7.25%, following a change in the underlying target asset mix.  

 The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Mortality  

 The mortality assumption at December 31, 2011 is the RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and non-annuitants), projected by Scale AA to 2019 for annuitants and 2027 for non-annuitants (December 31, 2010: projected to 2011 by Scale AA). This change more closely aligns assumptions made for accounting purposes to those for funding purposes. The impact of the change in mortality assumptions increased the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2011 by approximately $27 million.   

 54    
 Business discussion   

 As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2011, would have a life expectancy of 19 years.  

 Intangible assets  

 Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our intangible assets into three categories;  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed. Over 80% of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.  

 To determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the HRH acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified independent appraiser. The calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions. We base our allocation on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets.  

 Goodwill impairment review  

 We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  

 The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  

 Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit.  

 Determination of reporting units  

 We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments: North America; International and Global. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units.   

 55    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 Fair value of reporting units  

 The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated against our market capitalization.  

 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include estimations of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts, long-term rate of growth for our business and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  

 We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in goodwill impairment.  

 In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.  

 Annual goodwill impairment analysis  

 Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1. At October 1, 2011 our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge (2010: $nil, 2009: $nil). The fair values of the Global and International reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the North American unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14%.  

 In the fourth quarter of 2011 our North America segment continued to be hampered by declining Loan Protector business results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S. and declining retention rates primarily related to M&A activity and lost legacy HRH business. Consequently, the annual impairment test described above included additional sensitivity analysis, over and above that we would usually perform, in relation to our North America segments goodwill impairment review. This additional analysis included reductions to assumed rates of revenue growth, increases to assumed rates of expense growth and flexing the assumed weighted average cost of capital. Although our testing concluded there is no impairment, the analysis indicated that in respect of the North America segment, in the event of either a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of part of the reporting unit there could be an impairment to the carrying value in future periods.  

 Income taxes  

 We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.  

 At December 31, 2011, we had gross deferred tax assets of $432 million (2010: $294 million) against which a valuation allowance of $102 million (2010: $87 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 56    
 Business discussion   

 we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.  

 Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In 2011, there was a net increase in uncertain tax positions of $3 million compared to a net decrease of $4 million in 2010. The Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.  

 Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities  

 We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice.  

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  

 The Companys contractual obligations as at December 31, 2011 are presented below:

 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 Debt obligations and facilities  

 The Companys debt and related interest obligations at December 31, 2011 are shown in the above table.  

 In March 2011 we issued $800 million of new debt, comprised of $300 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and $500 million of 5.750% senior notes due 2021. We received net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses of approximately $787 million, which were used, to repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million, which represented a slight discount to the make-whole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing this debt. In addition to the make-whole payments of $158 million, we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.  

 In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a new 5-year $300 million term loan and a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit facility. The $300 million term loan repaid the majority of the $328 million balance outstanding on our $700 million 5-year term loan facility and the $500 million revolving facility replaces our existing $300 million and our $200 million revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $10 million relating to these facilities were written off in December 2011 following completion of the refinancing.  

 Conditions to borrowing under the banking facility include the accuracy and completeness in all material respects of all representations and warranties in the loan documentation and that no default under the banking facility then existed or would result from such borrowing or the application of the proceeds thereof. Voluntary prepayments are permitted without penalty or premium (subject to minimum amounts) and mandatory prepayments are required in certain circumstances.  

 We are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants and reporting obligations under the banking facility. These include, among others, limitations on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions, certain investments, fundamental changes, assets sales and restricted payments, and maintenance of certain financial covenants. Events of default under the banking facility include non-payment of amounts due to the lenders, violation of covenants, incorrect representations, defaults under other material indebtedness, judgments and specified insolvency-related events, certain ERISA events and invalidity of loan documents, subject to, in certain instances, specified thresholds, cure periods and exceptions.  

 At December 31, 2011 the only mandatory debt repayments falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled repayments on our new $300 million 5-year term loan totaling $11 million and repayment of the $4 million 6% loan notes due 2012.  

 Operating leases  

 The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  

 As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all non-cancellable operating lease agreements are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 58    
 Business discussion   

 The Company leases its main London building under a 25-year operating lease, which expires in 2032. The Companys contractual obligations in relation to this commitment included in the table above total $715 million (2010: $744 million). Annual rentals are $30 million per year and the Company has subleased approximately 29% of the premises under leases up to 15 years. The amounts receivable from subleases, included in the table above, total $82 million (2010: $87 million; 2009: $100 million).  

 Rent expense amounted to $127 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: $131 million; 2009: $154 million). The Companys rental income from subleases was $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: $22 million; 2009: $21 million).  

 Pensions  

 Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US, UK and international plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the plans.  

 UK plan  

 We made total cash contributions to our UK defined benefit pension plan of $92 million in 2011 (including amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice contribution) compared with $88 million in 2010 and $49 million in 2009.  

 In the UK we are required to agree to a funding strategy for our UK defined benefit plan with the plans trustees. In February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the UK plan of approximately $39 million for 2009 through 2011, excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition, if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any of those years, a further contribution of approximately $39 million was required for that year. The additional funding requirement was triggered in both 2010 and 2011.  

 The amounts included as contractual obligations in the table above reflect those payable under the current funding strategy which expires in March 2015, including amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice arrangements. Negotiations between the Company and the plan trustees on a revised funding strategy are continuing as set out in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.  

 US plan  

 We made total cash contributions to our US defined benefit pension plan of $30 million in 2011, compared with $30 million in 2010 and $27 million in 2009.  

 We expect to make contributions of approximately $40 million in 2012 through 2016 under US pension legislation based on our December 31, 2011 balance sheet position.  

 International plans  

 We made total cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $13 million in 2011, compared with $12 million in 2010 and $6 million in 2009.  

 In 2012, we expect to contribute approximately $12 million to our international plans.  

 Based on the current UK funding strategy and as shown in the table above, the total contracted contributions for all plans are currently estimated to be approximately $91 million in 2012, excluding amounts of approximately $12 million in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. However, a revised UK funding strategy, and hence 2012 contribution, is expected    

 59    
 Willis Group Holdings plc   

 to be finalized shortly and the final 2012 contribution for all plans is expected to be approximately $142 million, including salary sacrifice which compares to an equivalent 2011 total contribution of $135 million.  

 Guarantees  

 Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving credit facilities are discussed in Note 21  Commitments and Contingencies  in these consolidated financial statements.  

 Certain of Willis Group Holdings subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the UK and the US guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to $828 million and $855 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

 In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to $3 million and $11 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Willis Group Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish subsidiaries obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined benefit plans.  

 Other Contractual Obligations  

 For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value.  

 At December 31, 2011 the Company owned 50.1% of Gras Savoye Re., a company we consolidate in our financial statements. In January 2012 the co-shareholders of Gras Savoye exercised a put option for the Company to acquire the remaining 49.9% of Gras Savoye Re. for approximately $30 million and we anticipate concluding this transaction in March 2012.  

 Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates, and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options, including Gras Savoye Re., is not expected to exceed $72 million (2010: $40 million).  

 In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of $25 million to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital commitment of $25 million that had been made to Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at December 31, 2011 there have been approximately $6 million of capital contributions.  

 In May 2011, the Company made a capital commitment of $10 million to Dowling Capital Partners I, LP. As at December 31, 2011 there had been no capital contributions.  

 Other contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 also include the capital lease on the Companys Nashville property of $63 million, payable from 2012 onwards.  

 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

 In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.  

 In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements, requiring that the components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single    

 60    
 Business discussion   

 continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) or when an item of OCI must be reclassified to net income.  

 In September 2011, the FASB also issued guidance to allow an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. All of the above accounting changes become effective for the Company from first quarter 2012.  

 Further details of the changes are described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Other than the changes described above, there were no new accounting standards issued during 2011 that would impact on the Companys reporting.  

 OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS  

 Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
