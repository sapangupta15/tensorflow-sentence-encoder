ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

 Our primary source of market risk is the difference between the prices we sell our refined products for and the prices we pay for crude oil and other feedstocks. We may use derivative instruments to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil and refined products, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or to capture market opportunities. We have a risk committee whose responsibilities include reviewing a quarterly assessment of risks to the corporation and presenting a quarterly risk report to executive management for consideration.  

 Commodity Price Risks  

 Tesoro Refining and Marketing  

 Our earnings and cash flows from operations depend on the margin, relative to fixed and variable expenses (including the costs of crude oil and other feedstocks), at which we are able to sell our refined products. The prices of crude oil and refined products have fluctuated substantially in recent years and depend on many factors. These factors include the global supply and demand for crude oil and refined products. This demand is impacted by changes in the global economy, the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products, geo-political conditions, the availability of imports of crude oil and refined products, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, the marketing of alternative and competing fuels and the impact of government regulations. The prices we sell our refined products for are also affected by local factors such as local market conditions and the level of operations of other suppliers in our markets.  

 Prices for refined products are influenced by the price of crude oil. Generally, an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil results in a corresponding increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products. The timing, direction and the overall change in refined product prices versus crude oil prices will impact profit margins and could have a significant impact on our earnings and cash flows. Assuming all other factors remained constant, a $1 per barrel change in average gross refining margins, based on the average throughput from 2008 to 2010 of 541 Mbpd, would change annualized pretax operating income by approximately $200 million.  

 We maintain inventories of crude oil, intermediate products and refined products, the values of which are subject to fluctuations in market prices. Our inventories of refinery feedstocks and refined products totaled 27 million barrels and 20 million barrels at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The average cost of our refinery feedstocks and refined products at December 31, 2010, was approximately $42 per barrel on a LIFO basis, compared to market prices of approximately $96 per barrel. If market prices decline to a level below the average cost of these inventories, we would be required to write down the carrying value of our inventory to market.  

 We periodically use non-trading derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products. We may also use non-trading derivative instruments to manage price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels. These derivative instruments typically include exchange-traded futures and over-the-counter swaps and options, generally with durations of less than one year. We continue to monitor our hedging strategy in 2011.  

 We mark-to-market our derivative instruments and recognize the changes in their fair value in our statements of consolidated operations. We elected not to designate our derivative instruments as fair value hedges during 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began using fair value hedge accounting for a portion of our TPSA inventory.  

 Net earnings during 2010 and 2009 included net losses of $29 million and $68 million, respectively, on our derivative positions comprised of the following (dollars in millions and volumes in millions of barrels):

 Our open positions at December 31, 2010, will expire at various times primarily during 2011. We prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk associated with our derivative instruments. This analysis may differ from actual results. Based on our open net positions of five million barrels at December 31, 2010, a $1.00

 per-barrel change in quoted market prices of our derivative instruments, assuming all other factors remain constant, could change the fair value of our derivative instruments and pretax operating income by approximately $5 million.  

 Tesoro Panama Company Sociedad Anonima  

 We formed TPSA to use our leased pipeline and tank facilities in Panama by enhancing strategic partnerships, developing economies of scale around freight and storage opportunities, providing discretionary crude oil trading, expanding global commercial relationships and evaluating opportunities to source crude from alternative supply markets. We may use our excess storage capacity in Panama to take advantage of contango markets, when the price of crude oil is higher in the future than the current spot price. We use commodity derivatives to hedge crude oil held in connection with these arbitrage opportunities. The above table and sensitivity analysis includes approximately two million barrels in open derivative positions at December 31, 2010, entered into to manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with TPSA. The above sensitivity analysis, as it relates to these derivative instruments on a stand-alone basis, would not materially change the fair value of trading derivative instruments or pre-tax operating income.  

 We use fair value hedge accounting for certain derivatives instruments acquired by TPSA and the crude oil inventory underlying these instruments. If we designate a hedging relationship as a fair value hedge, we record the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability and any ineffective portion in cost of sales in our statements of consolidated operations.  

 Risk Management  

 The Company has a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of controls to ensure procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels. For example, the Company has put in place controls designed to:

 The Company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program.  

 Counterparty Credit Risk  

 We have exposure to concentrations of credit risk related to the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations, and the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We have risk management policies in place, and continue to monitor closely the status of our counterparties. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customersÂ’ financial condition, and in certain circumstances, require prepayments, letters of credit or other collateral.  

 Foreign Currency Risk  

 We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on our purchases of Canadian crude oil. Beginning in August 2009, we have entered into forward contracts of Canadian dollars to manage any monthly exchange rate fluctuations. We had approximately $1 million in losses related to these transactions for the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had a forward contract to purchase 65 million Canadian dollars that matured on January 25, 2011. Based on our open forward contract position, a $0.01 change in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate would change operating income by less than $1 million.
