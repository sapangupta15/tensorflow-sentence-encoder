           OVERVIEW  

 Key Drivers of Financial Performance  

 Operations  

 The key drivers of financial performance vary among our operations.  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services. Brokerage segment results are principally affected by:    

conditions in insurance markets, particularly fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies,   

success in attracting and keeping clients,   

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,   

interest income on our investments,   

expense management, and   

employee retention.   

 Consulting. Consulting segment results are principally affected by:    

our clients' employment levels, which are driven mainly by economic conditions,   

governmental regulations affecting the health care market, employee benefit programs and our clients' respective industries,   

success in attracting and keeping clients,   

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,   

expense management, and   

employee retention.   

 As more fully discussed below in "Key Recent Events," in November 2008 we completed the merger with Benfield Group Limited ("Benfield"), a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. Combining the Benfield operations with our existing and complementary reinsurance operations will allow Aon to offer clients an integrated set of risk management products and services, including treaty and facultative reinsurance, innovative risk capital management and related advisory services.  

 Liquidity  

 Liquidity is derived from cash flows from our businesses, excluding funds held on behalf of clients, and from financing. We use liquidity to:    

fund acquisitions and pension obligations,   

repurchase shares,   

repay debt,   

pay dividends to our stockholders, and   

pay for capital expenditures.   

 Because we are a holding company, our subsidiaries may not have available cash to pay us dividends. Our access to cash generated from operations outside the U.S. may be affected by tax considerations and by pension funding requirements in our international pension plans.

 Executive Summary of 2008 Financial Results  

 The insurance industry continued to experience a soft market, characterized by reduced premium rates, throughout 2008. In the second half of the year, the disruption in the global credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions, including those in the insurance industry. Despite this difficult market environment, we grew the business organically, took further steps to streamline our product portfolio around our core businesses while reducing capital requirements, and improved the financial flexibility of our balance sheet.  

 Organic growth in 2008 was 2%, with growth in both our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services (2%) and Consulting (3%) segments. We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses and unusual items from reported revenues.  

 Our consolidated pretax margins from continuing operations declined from 13.7% in 2007 to 11.3% in 2008 driven principally by higher restructuring charges relating to our 2007 restructuring program that we announced in October 2007. We incurred $254 million of restructuring charges in 2008 compared with $85 million in 2007. Restructuring costs in 2007 included $39 million related to our 2005 restructuring program, which has been completed.  

 The following is a summary of our 2008 financial results:    

Our revenues from continuing operations increased $272 million or 4% overall. More specifically: 

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue increased $273 million or 5%, and 

Consulting revenue increased $6 million, which was essentially even with last year.   

Operating expenses increased 6% in 2008 due primarily to higher restructuring costs, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher compensation costs, partially offset by the savings related to our restructuring programs.   

Income from continuing operations decreased $41 million in 2008 to $621 million, as higher costs, especially restructuring expenses, more than offset higher revenue and a lower tax rate.   

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.06 in 2008, essentially even with 2007's $2.07 per share. The one cent decline was driven by lower net income, mostly offset by lower diluted shares outstanding resulting from our stock repurchase program, and a lower effective tax rate.   

We completed the sale of our Combined Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Sterling Insurance Company ("Sterling") subsidiaries. We recognized a pretax gain on the sales of approximately $1.4 billion. We received $2,866 million in cash for these operations, after final adjustments. In addition, we received a one-time dividend of $325 million from CICA prior to the close of the transaction. As a result of the gains recognized on these sales, net income in 2008 was $1,462 million, an increase of 69% from $864 million in 2007.   

We utilized the funds received from the sales of CICA and Sterling to increase the volume of share repurchases early in the year. During 2008, we repurchased approximately 42.6 million shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. Share repurchases were halted in August in anticipation of the merger with Benfield.   

26 

Beginning in the third quarter 2007, we began a new global restructuring effort. This restructuring program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately $550 million. As a result of this effort, we:   

incurred $251 million in 2008 for workforce reduction and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other associated costs, and   

expect these efforts to reduce annual costs from our continuing operations by approximately $370 million by 2010 before any potential reinvestment of savings.    

 In August 2008, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to merge with Benfield. In November 2008, we completed the transaction, paying Benfield shareholders £3.50 per common share and £2.80 per preferred share ($1,281 million). We also acquired cash and assumed debt in the transaction. A portion of the cash acquired is restricted as to its use for general corporate purposes. We also announced in the fourth quarter a global restructuring plan in conjunction with the merger. The restructuring plan, which will continue through the end of 2011, is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. We estimate that this plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, and that approximately $104 million of the costs will be included in the purchase price allocation with the remainder being recorded in operations in future periods.  

 All of our financial information reflects the application of critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments, as discussed below under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."  

 These items are discussed further in the remainder of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.  

 KEY RECENT EVENTS  

 Acquisitions and Divestitures  

 In August 2008, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to merge with Benfield, a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. The merger was completed in November 2008. We funded the transaction through cash on hand. We intend to integrate the Benfield business with our existing reinsurance operations (Aon Re Global) and operate the division globally under the newly created Aon Benfield brand. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "Business Combinations" for further information.  

 In addition to Benfield, we purchased 30 companies during 2008, primarily related to our Risk and Insurance Brokerage operations, for an aggregate amount of $105 million. Among the other companies purchased, in early 2008 we agreed to buy substantially all of A. J. Gallagher's U.S. and U.K. reinsurance brokerage business for $30 million in cash, plus an additional payment based on revenue produced by the acquired businesses in the first year after the deal closed. This transaction gives us a larger presence as a reinsurance broker for accident, health and life insurance in the U.S., and for accident and specialty casualty and financial institutions insurance in the U.K.  

 In January 2009, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our FFG Insurance Company ("FFG"), Atlanta International Insurance Company ("AIIC") and Citadel Insurance Company ("Citadel") (together the "P&C operations") to National Indemnity Company. FFG and Citadel were property and casualty insurance operations that were in runoff and had been previously included in unallocated income and expense. Operating results for these units have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. AIIC was a unit of Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc. ("A&A") which was placed in run-off in 1985 when A&A discontinued its property and casualty insurance underwriting operations. At the time of our acquisition of A&A in 1997, we placed the operations of AIIC, among other run-off units still operated by A&A, into discontinued operations. The sale is subject to various closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2009. We estimate that we will  

27 

incur a pretax loss of approximately $191 million on the sale of these operations, which has been recorded in 2008 in discontinued operations.  

 In October 2008, we reached a definitive agreement to sell AIS Management Corporation ("AIS"), a broker for non-standard personal lines automobile coverage, which was previously included in our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, to Mercury General Corporation, for approximately $120 million in cash, plus a potential earn-out of up to $35 million, payable over the two years following the completion of the agreement. The sale was completed in early first quarter 2009. AIS's operating results are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. We expect to record a pretax gain from the sale of AIS in the first quarter 2009 of approximately $85 million.  

 In December 2007, we announced that we signed definitive agreements to sell our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. These two subsidiaries were previously included in an Insurance Underwriting segment. Both of these transactions were completed on April 1, 2008. In more detail:    

CICA was sold to ACE Limited for cash consideration of $2,525 million, after final adjustments. We also received a one-time dividend of $325 million from CICA prior to the close of the transaction.   

Sterling was sold to Munich Re Group for cash consideration of $341 million, after final adjustments.   

 We have included CICA and Sterling's operating results through the date of sale in discontinued operations. We recorded a pretax gain on these sales of approximately $1.4 billion.  

 Over the last three years, we have sold the following additional businesses that are also included in discontinued operations:    

Aon Warranty Group ("AWG") and its worldwide warranty and credit operations, which were previously included in the Insurance Underwriting segment, and   

Construction Program Group ("CPG"), a managing general underwriter whose policies were underwritten by Aon's property and casualty operation, which was previously included in both the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Insurance Underwriting segments.   

 Results of the businesses included in discontinued operations are as follows (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 In December 2008, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the U.S. operations of our premium finance business (Cananwill) to AFCO Credit Corporation. This sale did not qualify as a discontinued operation because we will have a continuing interest in the operations after the sale, and thus Cananwill's results continue to be included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. This transaction was completed in February 2009. We recorded a preliminary loss on the sale of this business of approximately $5 million in 2008. In connection with Aon's sale of its U.S. premium finance  

28 

business, Aon has guaranteed the collection of the principal amount of the premium finance notes sold to the buyer, estimated at closing to be approximately $745 million, if losses exceed the historical credit loss reserve for the business. Historical losses in this business have been very low since the premium finance notes are generally fully collateralized by the lender's right, in the event of non-payment, to cancel the underlying insurance contract and collect the unearned premium from the insurance carrier. In addition, we may receive up to $10 million from the buyer over the next two years based on the amount of insurance premiums and related obligations financed by the buyer over such period that are generated from certain of Cananwill's producers.  

 We also sold other, smaller operations during 2008. We recognized a pretax gain of $4 million on these dispositions, which is included in our income from continuing operations.  

 In 2007, we sold the following businesses that remained in our continuing operating results:    

Media Professionals, Inc. and two other, smaller operations, which were included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. We recognized total pretax gains of $32 million on these sales.   

25% of our Botswana subsidiary, which is included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. A pretax gain of $4 million was recognized on the sale.   

 See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, "Disposal of Operations," for further information.  

 Restructuring Initiatives  

 Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan  

 In fourth quarter 2008, we announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with our merger with Benfield. The restructuring plan, which will continue through the end of 2011, is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 500 to 700 job eliminations. Additionally, duplicate space and assets will be abandoned. We estimate that this plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, and that approximately $104 million of the costs will be included in the purchase price allocation with the remainder being recorded in operations in future periods.  

 The following is a summary of the restructuring costs related to the Aon Benfield Plan and our estimate of the amounts that will be included in the purchase price allocation and our ongoing operations (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The restructuring plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver cumulative cost savings of approximately $33-41 million in 2009, $84-94 million in 2010 and $122 million in 2011. All of the components of the restructuring plan are not finalized and actual savings, total costs and timing may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions of the plan, and to foreign exchange rates.  

29 

 2007 Restructuring Plan  

 In 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth to better serve clients ("2007 Plan"). The three-year plan has evolved as new opportunities have been identified and existing initiatives have been finalized. We estimate that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately $550 million. Expenses will include workforce reduction and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, as well as other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative. We recorded approximately $251 million and $46 million of restructuring and related expenses in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and expect the remaining restructuring and related expenses to affect operations through the end of 2009.  

 The 2007 Plan includes an estimated 3,900 job eliminations beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing into 2009. Through the end of 2008, 1,400 job eliminations have occurred. We also expect to close or consolidate several offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. Costs related to the restructuring are included in compensation and benefits, other general expenses and depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  

 The following table summarizes the 2007 restructuring and related expenses by type incurred and estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and approved include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause the Company to add or cancel component initiatives.  

 Workforce reductions reflect a cash expense, though we may recognize the expense before paying for the expenditure. Asset impairments are non-cash expenses. Lease consolidation accruals reflect the present value of future cash flows. Other costs are cash expenses, which are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  

 The following table summarizes actual restructuring and related expenses incurred and estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative, by segment (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Stock Repurchase Program  

 In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Aon's common stock. In November 2006, the Board increased that amount to $2 billion. In December 2007, the Board increased the authorization amount to $4.6 billion. We may repurchase shares using available capital through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions. Any repurchased shares will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. During second quarter 2008, we increased the volume of shares repurchased, as we began to use the proceeds received from the sales of CICA and Sterling. Share repurchases were halted in August in anticipation of the Benfield merger. Our remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under the program is $854 million. Because of the current volatility in both the financial markets and the broader economy, the timing for completion of the program is uncertain.  

 In 2008, we repurchased 42.6 million shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. Since the program began, we have repurchased 90.8 million shares at a cost of $3.7 billion. Of the shares repurchased since the program's inception, we have reissued approximately 23.3 million shares for stock options, stock awards, and other benefit plans.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Aon's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect:    

what we report as our assets and liabilities,   

what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and   

the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.   

 In accordance with our policies, we:    

regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning restructuring, pensions, contingencies, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and policy liabilities.   

base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances.   

 The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates.  

 We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements.  

 Restructuring  

 Restructuring costs that meet certain criteria are included in the purchase price allocation when related to an acquisition, or are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB Statement No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits and FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 applies to one-time workforce reduction benefits and requires companies to use Statement No. 112 when severance is paid under an ongoing severance policy. Lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other costs associated with restructuring are accounted for under Statement No. 146 and FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  

31 

 Workforce reduction costs  

 We account for workforce reduction costs that result from an ongoing severance plan under Statement No. 112. Such instances occur when (1) we have an established severance policy, (2) statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or (3) we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula.  

 We estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we:    

identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated,   

notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and   

expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period.   

 When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.  

 Lease consolidation costs  

 Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes.  

 Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and sublease losses  

 Accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value.  

 Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. However, we discount the severance arrangement when we terminate an employee who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. Accretion of the discount occurs over the remaining life of the liability.  

 For the remaining lease term or severance payout, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability.  

 Other associated costs of exit and disposal activities  

 We recognize other restructuring costs as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.  

 Asset impairments may result from large-scale restructurings and we account for these impairments in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments in accordance with Statement No. 144 by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life.  

32 

 Aon Benfield restructuring  

 We have developed a restructuring plan related to our acquisition of Benfield ("Aon Benfield Plan"). The Aon Benfield Plan is accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, and includes reductions in staffing levels and the abandonment of excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring activities and as part of the cost of the acquisition, we established liabilities, primarily for severance and excess facilities. As required by EITF Issue No. 95-3, we will finalize our restructuring plans no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. Upon finalization of the restructuring plans or settlement of obligations for less than the expected amount, any excess liabilities will be reversed with a corresponding decrease in goodwill.  

 Pensions  

 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (U.K.), the Netherlands and Canada.  

 Significant changes to pension plans  

 Our U.S. pension plans were closed to new entrants in 2004. In 2007, we began determining future pension benefits using a "career average pay" formula rather than the prior "final average pay" formula. Effective April 1, 2009, the Company will cease crediting future benefits relating to salary and service. As a result, we will recognize a curtailment gain of approximately $83 million in 2009. Our U.K. pension plans are also closed to new entrants. In 2007, future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in the U.K. plans.  

 Market-related value of assets  

 The U.S. pension plans use the market-related value of assets to determine expected return on assets.  

 As of year-end 2008:    

the market-related value of pension assets does not yet reflect accumulated asset losses of $217 million. These losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the market-related asset value and may be offset by future asset gains. We recognize 20% of the asset gain or loss in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years.   

we reported a fair value of pension assets of $1,087 million, while market-related value of assets is $1,304 million.   

 Our plans in the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada use fair value to determine expected return on assets.  

 Recognition of gains and losses and prior service  

 In accordance with FASB Statement No. 87 Employers' Accounting for Pensions, we defer recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and asset performance.  

 Unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the Netherlands and Canada, or the average life expectancy of the U.S. and U.K. plan members. Prior to the U.S. plan amendment to cease crediting future benefits relating to salary and service, we amortized unrecognized gains and  

33 

losses for the U.S. plan based on the average future service of active employees. After the adoption of this amendment, unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. plan will be based on the average life expectancy of plan members. We amortize prior service costs or credits which arise as a result of plan changes over a period based on the average expected future service of active employees in the plans at the time the prior service costs or credits were established.  

 As of December 31, 2008, the pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation ("PBO"). To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.  

 The following table discloses our combined experience loss, prior service costs or credits, the number of years that we are amortizing the experience loss over, and the estimated 2009 amortization by each plan (amounts in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The U.S. amount includes the impact of ceasing benefits relating to salary and service to U.S. participants, effective April 1, 2009.  

 Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation  

 The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Includes investments in infrastructure, real estate, limited partnerships and hedge funds.  

 We base our U.S. expected long-term return on capital market expectations for various asset classes. U.S. equities and fixed income expectations are estimated using a theoretical Capital Asset Pricing ("CAP") Model. The CAP Model for equities included three factors:    

Current dividend yield (2.8%)   

Corporate earnings nominal growth (6.3%)   

P/E ratio repricing (0.0%).   

34 

 A fixed income expectation factor of 4.9% included the then-current 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yields and simulations of future yields based on expected inflation and other factors. We based:    

other asset class expectations on risk premiums relative to U.S. equities and fixed income expected returns, and   

estimates of volatilities and correlations among asset classes on historical data.   

 The actual allocation at December 31, 2008 was 67% equities and 33% fixed income securities.  

 In determining the expected rate of return for the U.K., Netherlands and Canadian plans, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. We:    

consider historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and   

weight the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.   

 Generally, the U.K. plans' trustees determine the investment policy for each plan. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation represents a weighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change.  

 In total, at the end of the 2008 valuation year, the U.K. plans were invested 50% in equities and 50% in fixed income securities. The Netherlands's plan was invested 29% in equities and 71% in fixed income securities. The Canadian plans were invested 64% in equities and 36% in fixed income securities.  

 Impact of changing economic assumptions  

 Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.  

 Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated 2009 pension expense (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

35 

 Estimated future contributions  

 We estimate contributions of approximately $400 million in 2009, and we are continuing to pursue strategic alternatives to control volatility in the pension plans.  

 Contingencies  

 We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.  

 We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlement strategy.  

 Intangible Assets  

 Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. We classify our intangible assets as either goodwill, trademarks, client lists, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles. Our goodwill and other intangible balances at December 31, 2008 were $5,637 million and $779 million, respectively, compared to $4,915 million and $204 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The acquisition of Benfield in 2008 resulted in goodwill of $1,064 million and intangible assets of $583 million.  

 Although goodwill is not amortized, we test it for impairment at least annually. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we complete further analysis to determine whether there was an impairment loss. No further analysis was required in 2008 or 2007. We determine fair value based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results.  

 We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  

 Share-based Payments  

 Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest during that period. Thus, we have reduced expense for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. When the terms of an award require no additional service, the award is fully expensed at the grant date. When awards are modified, we account for the incremental shares at the fair market value at the date of modification. Expense recognition begins on the date the service period begins, which can precede or be after the grant date, depending on the provisions of the award.

 In 2006, we adopted Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payments, and changed our method of valuation for stock options granted. Beginning in 2006, we moved to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Lattice-based option valuation models:    

use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options and   

estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of Aon's stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Aon's stock.    

Furthermore, we:   

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model, differentiating between executives and key employees,   

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate, and   

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   

 The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.  

 Service-Based RSU Awards  

 Before 2006, restricted stock units ("RSUs") granted to employees were generally service-based and accounted for by expensing the total award value over the service period. We calculated the total award value by multiplying the total number of shares to be delivered by the quoted market value on the date of grant. In connection with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R) in 2006, we began to estimate forfeitures and considered dividend discounts when determining the fair value of the RSUs.  

 Performance-Based Awards  

 Beginning in 2006, executives and key employees may receive performance-based awards, which ultimately result in the receipt of RSUs, if the employee achieves his or her objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. The RSUs may be immediately vested or have a future additional service period. Generally, our performance awards are fixed, which means we determine the fair value of the award at the grant date, estimate the number of shares to be delivered at the end of the performance period, and recognize the expense over the performance or vesting period, whichever is longer.  

 These estimates take into account performance to date as well as the assessment of future performance. These assessments are made by management using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the expense recognized.  

 The largest performance-based stock plan is the Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP"). The 2006 to 2008 performance period ended on December 31, 2008. The LPP has two ongoing performance periods: 2007 to 2009 and 2008 to 2010. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage would have increased our current year's expense by approximately $1 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $3 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as well as U.S. federal and state tax laws.  

37 

 The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, and are based on management's:    

assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and   

judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of Statement No. 109.   

 We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a "more likely than not" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations because they are considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according to the Internal Revenue Code.  

 We base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those which deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.  

 We operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. While historically we have not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns, there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:    

During recent years, the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue.   

To deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities.   

We may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed, and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance.   

Tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes.   

 In 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which are recognized in a company's financial statements in accordance with Statement No. 109, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a company's tax return. As a result of our adoption of FIN 48, we did not record any adjustments to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  

 Policy Liabilities  

 As disclosed earlier, we signed a definitive agreement in January 2009 to sell our P&C operations. Assets and liabilities of these operations are reported in our consolidated statement of financial position as assets and liabilities held-for-sale. Included in liabilities held-for-sale are loss reserves of $122 million and $114 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which represent our best estimate of unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for reported and unreported losses incurred  

38 

as of the end of each accounting period. After the sale is closed, we will no longer have any obligation related to these claims and claims adjustment expenses. If these liabilities prove inadequate prior to the completion of the sale, we would be required to increase the reserves, which could hurt our results and financial condition.  

 Because setting loss reserve levels is inherently uncertain, we cannot guarantee that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Loss reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, given our informed judgments based on:    

currently available data,   

future trends in claims severity and frequency,   

judicial theories of liability, and   

other factors.   

 Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance, and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments, and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting the claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before we can definitively determine liability. We periodically refine our reserve estimates as further losses are reported and settled and we continue to adjust the reserves as necessary when we change our estimates.  

 We estimate loss reserves for all property and casualty lines of business by accident year using several standard actuarial techniques, which include, but are not limited to incurred and paid loss development methods, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, and frequency/severity methods. We project ultimate losses on a direct, assumed, ceded and net basis, and deduct paid losses from the selected ultimate losses to arrive at the total indicated reserve. The total indicated reserve includes case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves. Our loss reserve estimates are influenced by factors such as the consistency of the results from actuarial techniques and our knowledge of emerging loss trends and rate or benefit changes.  

 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

 General  

 In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information.  

 We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items.  

 Supplemental organic revenue growth information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our consolidated statements of income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.  

 Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, we have:    

isolated the impact of the change in currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue, and have disclosed the impact on expenses and earnings per share, and   

39 

provided this form of reporting to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations.   

 Some tables in the segment discussions reconcile organic revenue growth percentages to the reported commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages for the segments and subsegments. We disclose separately:    

the impact of foreign currency, and   

the impact from acquisitions, divestitures, transfer of business units, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items, which represent the most significant reconciling items.   

 Summary of Results for 2006 through 2008  

 The consolidated results of continuing operations follow (in millions):    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Consolidated Results for 2008 Compared to 2007  

 Revenue  

 During 2008, compared to the prior year:    

Commissions, fees and other increased $300 million or 4% driven primarily by organic growth of 2% and the impact of foreign exchange translation.   

Investment income decreased $28 million or 10%, driven by:   

lower non-liquidating distributions from our Private Equity Partnership Structure I, LLC ("PEPS I") investment of $29 million,   

lower realized gains from the sale of investments compared to 2007, and   

lower global interest rates.    

 The decrease was partially offset by investment income on higher invested balances from selling CICA and Sterling.  

40 

           This chart shows consolidated revenue by geographic area (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 We attribute revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues.    

U.S. revenue decreased $25 million or 1%, reflecting declines in U.S. retail operations due to a slowdown in private equity and commercial construction activity and soft market conditions, partially offset by growth in our affinity and reinsurance business.   

Americas other than U.S. revenue increased $82 million or 10%, due to strong organic growth in Latin America and the impact of foreign exchange rates.   

United Kingdom revenue decreased $56 million or 4% driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, lower investment income and soft market conditions, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.   

Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased $237 million or 13% as a result of favorable foreign exchange, acquisitions and organic revenue growth, most notably in Italy, Spain, Africa and the Middle East, partially offset by lower investment income.   

Asia Pacific revenue increased $34 million to $660 million, driven by organic revenue growth in most countries in Asia, along with favorable foreign exchange, which more than offset the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan.   

 Expenses  

 The increase in total operating expenses of $357 million or 6% from 2007 is driven by:    

$240 million or 6% increase in compensation and benefits, reflecting the impact of higher restructuring charges, acquisitions, unfavorable foreign exchange, as well as higher salary and incentive costs, which more than offset significant restructuring savings.   

$88 million or 5% increase in other general expenses, were driven by higher E&O expenses, costs related to anti-bribery investigations and compliance initiatives, and higher restructuring charges. The increase in costs was partially offset by foreign exchange transaction gains and one-time expenses in 2007 relating to the settlement of litigation for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business and the resolution of a U.K. balance sheet reconciliation difference.   

$29 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to increased amortization due to acquisitions along with restructuring-related impairments and higher software amortization.   

 Interest expense declined $12 million, due primarily to the redemption of our 3.5% Senior Convertible Debentures during 2007.  

 Other (income) expense was an expense of $39 million in 2008 versus income of $35 million in 2007. The higher expense was driven by costs associated with acquiring Benfield and lower net gains on sale of businesses.  

41 

 Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Tax  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $863 million, a 15% decrease from $1,010 million in 2007. The decrease was driven by higher restructuring costs, costs associated with acquiring Benfield, and expenses related to anti-bribery investigations and compliance initiatives, which more than offset organic growth in both our segments and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.  

 Provision for Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.0% in 2008 and 34.5% in 2007.  

 Differences between the overall effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are typically due to U.S. state income taxes and differences between U.S. and international tax rates. Changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income directly affect our effective tax rates. In:    

2008 and 2007, our effective tax rate also reflects the favorable resolution of tax examination issues, adjustments, and tax credits.   

2008, our rate was reduced by changes in corporate tax rates in certain foreign countries, most notably in the U.K., which reduced the enacted corporate tax rate from 30% to 28%.   

2007, the lower U.K. tax rate required us to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax assets using the new enacted tax rate, resulting in a one-time non-cash expense of $24 million.   

 For a summary of these effects, please see the rate reconciliation provided in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 In 2008, compared to 2007:    

Income from continuing operations declined to $621 million ($2.06 diluted net income per share) from $662 million ($2.07 diluted net income per share). Currency fluctuations positively impacted our income from continuing operations in 2008 by $0.16 per diluted share when we translate last year's statement of income at this year's foreign exchange rates. 2007's income from continuing operations was positively impacted by $0.06 per diluted share.   

Basic net income per share from continuing operations decreased to $2.18 in 2008 from $2.23 in 2007.   

 Discontinued Operations  

 After-tax income from discontinued operations was:    

$841 million in 2008 ($2.94 and $2.80 per basic and diluted net income per share, respectively). These results include the gain on the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries, the operations of CICA and Sterling for the first quarter of 2008, and the full year operations of AIS. These gains were offset in part by the estimated loss on sale of our remaining P&C operations.   

$202 million in 2007 ($0.67 and $0.62 per basic and diluted income per share, respectively). Last year's results were mainly due to a full year of operations for CICA and Sterling.   

42 

 Revenue from discontinued operations decreased to $775 million in 2008 from $2.6 billion in 2007 as only one quarter of CICA and Sterling was included in 2008, versus a full year in 2007. After-tax income from discontinued operations increased $639 million to $841 million, driven by:    

the gain on the sale of CICA and Sterling ($935 million), partially offset by only one quarter of operations in 2008 for CICA and Sterling versus a full year in 2007 ($150 million) and   

the estimated loss on the sale of the P&C operations ($116 million). The sale of these operations eliminates any future exposure to the run-off of the P&C operations.   

 See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, "Disposal of Operations," for further information.  

 Consolidated Results for 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Revenue  

 In 2007, compared to the prior year:    

Commissions, fees and other increased $509 million or 8% driven primarily by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and organic revenue growth of 2%.   

Investment income increased $80 million or 38%. The increase was driven by   

 non-liquidating distributions from our PEPS I investment of $61 million,  

 $14 million of realized losses on our Endurance warrants in 2006,  

 realized gains from the sale of investments, and  

 higher interest rates on our investment portfolio.    

 These increases were partially offset by a $35 million gain recognized in 2006 in connection with the contribution of our preferred stock investment in Scandent, received from the sale of our Cambridge operation, to one of our U.K. pension plans.  

 By geography:    

U.S. revenue increased $65 million or 2%, reflecting growth in our retail business and affinity operations, partially offset by a soft reinsurance market and lower investment gains attributable to the gain recognized in 2006 on the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock.   

Americas other than U.S. revenue increased $86 million or 12%, due to strong growth in Latin America and the impact of foreign exchange rates.   

United Kingdom revenue increased $133 million or 11% driven by favorable foreign exchange, the impact of acquisitions, higher investment income and a gain on the sale of a book of business.   

Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased $240 million or 15% as a result of favorable foreign exchange, higher investment income, acquisitions and organic revenue growth, most notably in France, Italy, Spain, Africa and the Middle East.   

Asia Pacific revenue increased $65 million to $626 million, driven by favorable foreign exchange and organic revenue growth in most Asian countries, which more than offset softness in Australia and the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan.   

43 

 Expenses  

 The $306 million or 5% increase in operating expenses versus 2006 is driven by:    

$169 million or 4% increase in compensation and benefits, reflecting $189 million of unfavorable foreign exchange as well as higher salary and incentive costs, which more than offset significant pension savings, lower restructuring costs and the benefits of the 2005 restructuring program. Reduced pension expense was due primarily to plan amendments in the U.S. and U.K.   

$166 million or 11% increase in other general expenses, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of acquisitions and the settlement of litigation in early 2007 for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business.   

$29 million decrease in depreciation and amortization due to lower write-offs and a lower depreciable base than the prior year.   

 Interest expense rose $9 million as a result of higher interest rates and foreign exchange translation.  

 Other income increased $8 million, resulting from the gain on sale of businesses in 2007 partially offset by the gain on the 2006 sale of our building in Spain.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Tax  

 Income from continuing operations was $1,010 million, a 39% increase from $728 million in 2006. The increase was driven by improved profitability in our brokerage and consulting segments and distributions from our PEPS I investment.  

 Provision for Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 34.5% in 2007 and 32.8% in 2006. In 2007 and 2006, our effective tax rate reflects the favorable resolution of tax examination issues, adjustments, and tax credits. In addition, our 2007 rate was impacted by changes in corporate tax rates in certain foreign countries, most notably in the United Kingdom, which decreased the enacted corporate tax rate from 30% to 28%. We had to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax assets using the new enacted tax rate, resulting in a one-time non-cash expense of $24 million.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 In 2007, compared to 2006:    

Income from continuing operations rose to $662 million ($2.07 diluted net income per share) from $489 million ($1.45 diluted net income per share). Currency fluctuations positively impacted our income from continuing operations in 2007 by $0.06 per diluted share, when we translate last year's statement of income at this year's exchange rates. 2006's income from continuing operations was negatively impacted by $0.04 per diluted share.   

Basic net income per share from continuing operations increased to $2.23 from $1.54.   

 Discontinued Operations  

 After-tax income from discontinued operations was:    

$202 million in 2007 ($0.67 and $0.62 per basic and diluted net income per share, respectively). These results include a full year of operations for CICA and Sterling, AIS, our remaining P&C operations, as well as residual settlement activity relating to our 2006 AWG and CPG disposals.   

$230 million in 2006 ($0.73 and $0.68 per basic and diluted income per share, respectively). Results in 2006 include a full year of operations for CICA, AIS and our remaining P&C operations, and eleven months of operations and the gain on sale of AWG and CPG.

 REVIEW BY SEGMENT  

 General  

 Aon classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information).  

 Aon's operating segments report separate financial information and we evaluate them regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.  

 Segment revenue includes investment income generated by invested assets of that segment, as well as the impact of related derivatives. Our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in short-term obligations.  

 The following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Intersegment revenues of $25 million, $29 million and $59 million were included in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services  

 Aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry. Aon was ranked in 2008 by Business Insurance as the world's largest insurance broker, by A.M. Best as the number one global insurance brokerage in 2008 and 2007 based on brokerage revenues, and voted the best insurance intermediary and best reinsurance intermediary in 2008 and 2007 by the readers of Business Insurance.  

 In 2007, we experienced a soft market in many business lines/segments and in many geographic areas. In a "soft market," premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. Prices fell throughout the year, with the greatest declines seen in large and middle-market accounts. Prices continued to decline during 2008, although the rate of decline slowed toward the end of the year. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds.  

 We are facing increasingly difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets may reduce our customers' demand for our brokerage and reinsurance services and products, which could hurt our operational results and financial condition. In addition, overall capacity in the industry could decrease if a significant insurer either fails or withdraws from writing insurance coverages that we offer our clients. This failure could reduce our revenues and profitability, since we would no longer have access to certain lines and types of insurance.  

45 

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 82% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2008. Revenues are generated primarily through:    

fees paid by clients,   

commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and   

interest income on funds held on behalf of clients.   

 Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of:    

the timing of our clients' policy renewals,   

the net effect of new and lost business,   

the timing of services provided to our clients, and   

the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.   

 Our risk brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, this segment:    

addresses the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcare providers, and non-profit groups, among others;   

provides affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses;   

provides reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance;   

provides investment banking products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications;   

provides managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients;   

provides actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and   

manages captive insurance companies.   

 In December 2008, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the U.S. operations of the premium finance business of Cananwill. The transaction was completed in February 2009.  

 We review our revenue results using the following subsegments:    

Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage encompasses our retail brokerage services, affinity products, managing general underwriting, placement and captive management services, and premium finance services in: Americas; United Kingdom; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific.   

Reinsurance Brokerage and Related Services (Reinsurance) offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that:     

 enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios,  

 improve capital utilization, and  

 evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide.    

46 

 This subsegment also provides investment banking products and services for insurance companies.  

 Revenue  

 This table details Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services commissions, fees and other by subsegment (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 In 2008, commissions, fees and other increased $286 million or 5% from 2007 reflecting organic growth in our reinsurance and most of our retail operations, as well as the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates.  

 This table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other growth for 2008 versus 2007:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Organic revenue growth for the entire segment was 2%.  

 The 1% reported growth in Americas reflects strong new business growth in Latin America, as well as growth in our Affinity and Canadian operations, partially offset by a decline in U.S. retail, primarily due to soft market conditions, as well as our premium financing operations.  

 United Kingdom commissions, fees and other declined 3% driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and soft market conditions, partially offset by acquisitions and growth in our Captives operation.  

 Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased 13%, driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, and 4% organic revenue growth with strong growth in Italy, Spain, the Middle East and Africa.  

 Asia Pacific commissions, fees and other increased 2%, due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and strong organic growth in Asia and New Zealand, partially offset by the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan.  

47 

 Reinsurance commissions, fees and other increased 11%, due to the Gallagher Re and Benfield purchases, favorable foreign currency translation, and 1% organic revenue growth reflecting growth in facultative and treaty placements, partially offset by soft market conditions and greater client retention.  

 The following table sets forth our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue by geographic area and total pretax income (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 U.S. revenue increased 1% over 2007 reflecting growth in our Affinity and reinsurance operations. The increase was partially offset by declines in our U.S. retail and premium finance operations, reflecting soft market conditions.  

 Americas other than U.S. revenue increased 11% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth in our Latin American and Affinity operations, partially offset by lower investment income.  

 The 4% decrease in United Kingdom revenue is driven by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, lower investment income, and soft market conditions.  

 Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased 12% due to positive foreign currency translation, investment income gains and organic revenue growth, most notably in Italy, Spain, the Middle East and Africa.  

 Asia Pacific revenue increased 3% due to the impact of favorable foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth across most of the region, partially offset by lower investment income and the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan.  

 Income Before Income Tax  

 Pretax income decreased $136 million or 13% from 2007 to $874 million. In 2008, pretax margins in this segment were 14.0%, down 300 basis points from 17.0% in 2007. Contributing to decreased margins and pretax income were:    

an increase of $163 million in restructuring expenses,   

anti-bribery and compliance initiative costs of $42 million,   

higher E&O costs,   

lower gains on the sale of businesses compared to last year, and   

lower investment income.   

 These items were partially offset by:    

2% organic growth,   

realized savings from our restructuring programs (primarily workforce reduction),   

48 

a $21 million litigation settlement for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business in 2007,   

pension expense savings, and   

favorable foreign exchange rates.   

 Consulting  

 Aon Consulting is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. Our consulting segment:    

provides a broad range of consulting services, and   

generated 18% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2008.   

 The recent disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets has created significant uncertainty in the marketplace. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn could hurt our clients' financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. While we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time, these challenges may reduce demand for some of our services or depress pricing of those services and have an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.  

 We review our revenue results using the following subsegments:    

Consulting Services, which provides consulting services in five practice areas: 

1.Health and Benefits advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs that attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence management, benefits administration, data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory and elective benefits services. 

2.Retirement professionals specialize in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration. 

3.Compensation focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries. 

4.Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change management.   

Outsourcing, which offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment-related services.   

 Revenue  

 In 2008, commissions, fees and other of $1,353 million were 1% higher than 2007. On an organic basis, revenue increased 3% from 2007.

 This table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other growth in 2008 versus 2007:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 On a subsegment basis,    

Consulting services increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting growth in most major practice groups and geographies partially offset by the disposal of a small business.   

Outsourcing revenue declined $22 million or 9%, driven by lower revenue from AT&T. AT&T, our largest outsourcing client, terminated many of its outsourcing services with us in 2006 and terminated our remaining services during 2007.   

 This table shows Consulting revenue by geographic area and pretax income (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

U.S. revenue decreased $34 million in 2008, primarily due to reduced outsourcing business related to the loss of revenue from AT&T (see above) and a $5 million gain on the sale of an investment in 2007, partially offset by organic revenue growth in Consulting Services.   

Americas other than U.S. revenue grew 7%, reflecting improved results in Canada and favorable foreign exchange.   

United Kingdom revenue declined 6%, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange translation despite strong organic revenue growth.   

Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific revenue increased 13% and 27%, respectively, driven by favorable foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth.   

50 

 Income Before Income Tax  

 Pretax income was $213 million, an increase of $24 million or 13% from 2007. 2008 pretax margins in this segment were 15.7%, an increase of 170 basis points from 14.0% in 2007. The pretax income and margin improvement was principally driven by:    

5% organic revenue growth in Consulting Services,   

benefits related to our restructuring program, and   

operational improvements.   

 These improvements were partially offset by:    

the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation,   

higher restructuring costs, and   

the 2007 gain on the sale of an investment.   

 Unallocated Income and Expense  

 Unallocated income consists primarily of investment income, including income or loss on investment disposals and other-than-temporary impairment losses, which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments. We include invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses.  

 Private equities are principally carried at cost; however, where we have significant influence, they are reported using the equity method of accounting. These investments usually do not pay dividends. Limited partnerships ("LPs") are accounted for using the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying LP investments flow through unallocated investment income.  

 This table details our unallocated income and expense (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Unallocated investment income was $68 million in 2008, a decrease of $11 million over 2007 and was driven by:    

a $29 million decrease in income from our PEPS I investment, partially offset by   

higher investment income from marketable securities due to the investment of proceeds from the sale of CICA and Sterling.   

 Unallocated expenses include corporate governance and other costs not attributable to the operating segments. These expenses increased to $166 million in 2008 from $130 million in 2007, driven by:    

$50 million of hedging costs related to the merger with Benfield and   

higher stock compensation expense.   

 The higher costs were partially offset by:    

lower Corporate staff expenses,   

the 2007 resolution of a $15 million reconciliation difference in the U.K.,   

lower pension expense, and   

51 

2007 expenses associated with a review of historical equity compensation practices.   

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, decreased $12 million in 2008 to $126 million, principally due to the redemption of our 3.5% Senior Convertible Debentures in 2007.  

 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  

 Liquidity  

 Our operating subsidiaries obtain liquidity through selling their products and services and collecting their receivables. These subsidiaries use the funds collected to pay creditors and employees and to fund acquisitions. They segregate funds that Aon is holding on behalf of clients to satisfy policyholder liabilities, so they are not available for other uses. We believe that our operating subsidiaries will have adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company.  

 Our parent company's routine liquidity needs include paying corporate expenses, servicing debt, and paying dividends on Aon's outstanding stock. We meet these requirements primarily through dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries. We may also use available liquidity for capital expenditures and repurchasing common stock.  

 Cash in our consolidated statements of financial position includes funds available for operations.  

 During 2008, we:    

received $2.8 billion, net of taxes, from the sales of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries   

paid $1.3 billion to acquire all the common and preferred shares of Benfield, and   

spent $1.9 billion to repurchase 42.6 million of our outstanding shares of common stock.   

 In 2008, total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were $177 million, compared with cash contributions of $211 million in 2007. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate 2009 contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans of approximately $400 million.  

 In 2007, our principal U.K. subsidiary agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £9.4 million per year to one of our U.K. pension plans for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by approximately 5% on each April 1. In 2008, we contributed £9.7 million ($19 million). The trustees of the plan:    

have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 5, 2008, the estimated winding-up deficit was £440 million ($642 million at December 31, 2008 exchange rates).   

have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the above deficit be paid.   

 Cash Flows  

 Cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities.  

52 

 Cash flows provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Insurance Underwriting operating cash flows  

 In 2008 and 2007, our insurance underwriting operations include accident & health and life and certain P&C operations in run-off. These insurance products have distinct differences in the timing of premiums earned and payment of future liabilities. As noted earlier, we sold our CICA and Sterling businesses on April 1, 2008.  

 Our operating cash flows from our insurance subsidiaries was $5 million for 2008, a decrease of $330 million compared to 2007. Due to the sale of CICA and Sterling, cash flows for 2008 include activity only through the date of sale. For 2008, operating cash flows, analyzed by major income statement component, indicated that premium and other fees collected, net of reinsurance, were $624 million compared to $2,339 million in 2007. Investment and other miscellaneous income received was $49 million and $183 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 The insurance underwriting subsidiaries used revenues generated from premiums, investments and other miscellaneous income to pay claims and other cash benefits, commissions, general expenses and taxes. Claims and other cash benefits paid were $373 million in 2008 versus $1,321 million in 2007. Commissions and general expenses paid were $232 million for 2008, compared to $793 million in 2007. Tax payments for 2008 were $63 million compared to $73 million last year.  

 Funds held on behalf of clients  

 In our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, we typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of:    

premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers. These premiums held on behalf of, or due from, clients are reported as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurer.   

claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. Claims held by, or due to us and which are due to clients, are also shown as both assets and liabilities.   

 These funds held on behalf of clients are generally invested in interest bearing trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers.  

 All other operating cash flows  

 Our operating cash flows from our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, as well as related corporate items, was $429 million in 2008 compared to $904 million in 2007. The decline in operating cash flows, in part, is due to $376 million of taxes paid on the gain from the sales of CICA and Sterling. These amounts exclude the change in funds held on behalf of clients as described above. The operating cash flows depend on the timing of receipts and payments related to revenues, incentive compensation, other operating expenses and income taxes.  

 Aon uses the excess cash generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses as well as dividends received from CICA prior to its sale to meet its liquidity needs, which consist of acquisitions, servicing its debt, paying dividends to its stockholders and repurchasing outstanding shares.  

53 

 Investing and Financing Activities  

 Investing activities generated cash of $1.4 billion. We received $2.8 billion in cash from the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. Cash flows used by investing activities included purchases, net of sales of investments, of $217 million. Cash of $103 million was used for capital expenditures, net of disposals. Acquisitions during 2008 included the merger with Benfield for $991 million, net of cash acquired, and various other acquisitions of $105 million.  

 Our financing needs were $2.2 billion. Financing uses primarily included share repurchase activity, net of reissuance for our employee benefit plans of $1.7 billion, cash dividends paid to shareholders of $171 million, and debt repayments, net of issuance, of $386 million.  

 Financial Condition  

 In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity as short-term investments.  

 In our consolidated statements of financial position, we report fiduciary assets equal to our fiduciary liabilities. Our fiduciary assets include short-term investments of $3,178 million and $3,122 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Comparing year-end 2008 with year-end 2007:    

Working capital, excluding assets and liabilities held-for-sale, decreased $435 million to $1.6 billion, reflecting lower short-term investments as a result of repurchasing shares and the purchase of Benfield.   

Assets and liabilities held-for-sale both declined substantially from 2007 as a result of the disposition of CICA and Sterling.   

Short-term debt decreased by $147 million as a result of paying down our short-term borrowings under our Euro facility, partially offset by debt assumed from Benfield.   

Goodwill increased $722 million, due primarily to the Benfield merger ($1,064 million), partially offset by a decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates.   

Other intangible assets increased $575 million, mainly due to the Benfield merger, partially offset by current year amortization.   

Long-term debt decreased by $21 million, as higher Euro Credit facility borrowings were more than offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.   

Pensions, post employment and post retirement liabilities increased by $443 million as a result of adverse pension asset performance, mortality changes and lower discount rates in the U.S. This increase more than offset the impact of contributions made to our pension plans, higher discount rates in the international plans and the impact of foreign currency translation.   

Other non-current liabilities increased by $265 million due primarily to the merger with Benfield in 2008.   

 Borrowings  

 Total debt at December 31, 2008, was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $168 million from December 31, 2007, reflecting lower overall borrowings under our Euro Credit facility and the impact of foreign currency translation, offset in part by an increase due to including debt related to a variable interest entity for which Benfield is the primary beneficiary.  

54 

 Our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 27.1% and 25.6% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 We have disclosed future payments of our long-term debt and operating lease commitments with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 At December 31, 2008, we had a $600 million U.S. committed bank credit facility, which expires in February 2010, to support commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. This facility allows us to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit.  

 We also have foreign credit facilities available. At December 31, 2008, we had available to us:    

a five-year €650 million ($912 million) multi-currency facility, of which $605 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on both our U.S. and Euro facilities, and   

a 364-day €25 million ($35 million) facility.   

 This table shows the major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 24, 2009:    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 During 2008, Moody's Investor Service changed our rating outlook to stable from positive, reflecting the integration risk associated with the recently completed Benfield merger and the decline in our cash position.  

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would:    

increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility, and   

increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether. Although we have committed backup lines, we cannot ensure that our financial position will not be hurt if we can no longer access the commercial paper market.   

 Stockholders' Equity  

 Stockholders' equity decreased $911 million during 2008 to $5.3 billion, driven by share repurchase activity, net of reissuances for our employee benefit plans of $1,678 million, an increase in our net post-retirement benefit obligation of $497 million and a decrease in our foreign currency translation of $182 million, offset in part by our 2008 net income of $1,462 million.  

 Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $736 million since December 31, 2007. Compared to year-end 2007:    

net foreign exchange translation decreased by $182 million because of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, especially in the fourth quarter,   

net derivative losses were $37 million,   

net unrealized investment losses were $20 million, and   

55 

our net post-retirement benefit obligation increased by $497 million, reflecting adverse pension asset performance and lower discount rates.   

 Variable Interest Entities  

 Globe Re Limited ("Globe Re") is a limited-life reinsurance vehicle. In June 2008, Globe Re entered into a reinsurance agreement with a third party reinsurance company, whereby Globe Re provides reinsurance coverage for a defined portfolio of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts underwritten by the third party. The reinsurance coverage is for a one-year period. Globe Re is deemed a VIE since the equity investors at risk lack a controlling financial interest. A subsidiary of Aon Benfield owns an 85% equity economic interest in Globe Re, and therefore is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As such, Aon is required to consolidate Globe Re under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. At December 31, 2008, Globe Re had assets of $187 million and liabilities of $105 million. If a disaster such as U.S. wind damage, which accounts for approximately 80% of the coverage, occurs, we could lose our equity investment in Globe Re of approximately $20 million. In addition, if the counterparty bank which we have a total return swap with defaults, we could also lose our equity investment.  

 Juniperus Insurance Opportunity Fund Limited ("Juniperus"), a VIE, is an investment vehicle that invests in an actively managed and diversified portfolio of insurance risks. In 2008, a subsidiary of Aon Benfield acquired a 76% equity interest in the Juniperus' Class A shares. Also in 2008, Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited ("JCHL") was formed to provide investment management and related services to Juniperus. Aon Benfield has 55% of the economic interest and 66% of the voting interest of JCHL. Based on Aon Benfield's equity interest in Juniperus, it is subject to a majority of the expected residual returns and losses. Similarly, Aon Benfield's equity interest and loan to JCHL would deem it to absorb a majority of the expected losses in JCHL. Therefore, Aon Benfield is considered the primary beneficiary of both companies. Aon is required to consolidate both Juniperus and JCHL under the provisions of FIN 46(R). At December 31, 2008, Juniperus and JCHL together had assets of $121 million and liabilities of $68 million. For Juniperus, if a disaster such as wind, earthquakes or other named catastrophe occurs, we could lose some or all of our equity investment of approximately $55 million.  

 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We record various contractual obligations as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. While we do not recognize other items as liabilities in the financial statements, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, we are required to disclose them.  

 Aon and its subsidiaries:    

have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $3 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties,   

accrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable, and   

use special purpose entities ("SPEs") and qualifying special purpose entities ("QSPEs"), also known as special purpose vehicles, in some of our operations, following the guidance of FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, and other relevant accounting guidance.   

 Reinsurance Guarantee  

 In connection with the AWG transaction, we issued an indemnification which protects the purchaser from credit exposure relating to the property and casualty reserves that have been reinsured.  

56 

These reinsurance recoverables amount to $649 million at December 31, 2008. Trust balances and letters of credit offsetting these reinsurance recoverables were approximately $145 million. The balance of the liability was $9 million and $12 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, reflecting the fair value of this indemnification.  

 The liability represents the present value of the indemnification on the credit risk of the reinsurers. With the sale of the remaining P&C insurance underwriting operations, which we expect to be completed by mid 2009, the buyer will assume the guarantee with respect to reinsurance recoverables.  

 Premium Financing  

 Some of our U.S., U.K., Canadian, and Australian subsidiaries originate short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance their insurance premium obligations, and then sell these premium finance agreements in securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting under Statement No. 140.  

 In December 2008, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the U.S. operations of the premium finance business (Cananwill) to AFCO Credit Corporation. This disposition was completed in February 2009. Cananwill's results are included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment.  

 In the U.S. and U.K., premium finance agreements are sold to SPEs, which are considered QSPEs as defined by Statement No. 140. The QSPEs fund their purchases of premium finance agreements by selling undivided beneficial interests in the agreements to Bank SPEs. In Canada and Australia, undivided interests in the premium finance agreements are sold directly to Bank SPEs. The Bank SPEs are variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46R.  

 The sale agreements limit the total amount advanced by the Bank SPEs on premium finance agreements sold to them at any one time, which were $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. After the sale of the U.S. operations, the amount that can be advanced by the Bank SPEs is approximately $240 million.  

 We have not consolidated the QSPEs used in the U.S. and U.K. in our financial statements because we have met the criteria for sale accounting under Statement No. 140.  

 For the Canadian and Australian sales, we determined that non-consolidation of the Bank SPEs is appropriate in accordance with FIN 46R because we are not their primary beneficiary. We have reached this determination by analyzing specific qualitative and quantitative factors related to our transactions with the Bank SPEs, including:    

the fact that we are not the sponsor of any of the Bank SPEs,   

various other unaffiliated companies sell receivables to the Bank SPEs, and   

unaffiliated third parties have either made substantial equity investments in the Bank SPEs, hold voting control of the Bank SPEs, or generally have the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the Bank SPEs through liquidity support agreements or other arrangements involving significant variable interests.   

 Our variable interest in the Bank SPEs in these jurisdictions is limited to our retained interests in premium finance agreements sold to the Bank SPEs. We review all material off-balance sheet transactions annually or whenever a reconsideration event occurs for the continued propriety of our accounting.  

 The Bank SPEs had advanced to us $981 million and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, on portfolios sold to the Bank SPEs of $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

57 

 We record gains on the sale of premium finance agreements. When we calculate the gain, we include all costs we expect to incur for the relevant Bank SPEs. The gains, which are included in commissions, fees and other revenue in the consolidated statements of income, were $54 million, $64 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, we:    

record our retained interest in the sold premium finance agreements at fair value, and report it in receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position,   

estimate fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows using discount rates that are commensurate with the underlying risk, expected future prepayment rates, and credit loss estimates, and   

retain servicing rights for sold agreements, and earn servicing fee income over the servicing period. Because the servicing fees represent adequate compensation for the servicing the receivables, we have not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities.   

 The third-party bank sponsors or other participants in the Bank SPEs provide the liquidity support and bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse, in the form of over-collateralization, which we (and other sellers) provide, as required by the sales agreements. The over-collateralization of our sold receivables represents our maximum exposure to credit-related losses, and was approximately $171 million at December 31, 2008. We also:    

remain contingently liable should the funding costs of the U.S. Bank SPEs exceed the interest and late fees accrued or collected on the sold U.S. portfolio and   

continually review our retained interest in the sold portfolio, taking into consideration credit loss trends in the sold portfolio, conditions in the credit markets and other factors, and adjust its carrying value accordingly.   

 With the exception of our Australian sales agreements, all our other sales agreements require us to meet the following covenants:    

consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion,   

consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated net interest of at least 4 to 1, and   

consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3 to 1.   

 Effect of market conditions on renewal process  

 For those operations we continue to own, we intend to renew the conduit facilities, which have 364-day terms, as they expire. The current environment in the credit markets has influenced the renewal process and the renewed U.S., Canadian and U.K. terms are more restrictive. In more detail:    

the over-collateralization requirements have increased significantly (a total of $50 million on the renewal dates),   

based upon our estimated needs for the coming year, we reduced the level of committed availability by $479 million at the renewal dates, have further reduced the committed availability to its current level, and had scheduled additional decreases of $160 million by March 31, 2009.   

the securitization program costs added on the pass-through funding costs from the U.S. Bank SPEs.   

 Moreover, as our ability to originate and fund new premium finance agreements is dependent on the pass-through funding costs of the Bank SPEs, disruptions in the markets through which the Bank  

58 

SPEs obtain funds could further diminish our premium finance results of operations and cash flows. Our Australian facility expires in June 2009, and we expect similar restrictive terms.  

 We also face the risk the Bank SPEs will be unable to provide the liquidity or will become an unreliable source of the liquidity necessary to fund new premium finance agreements. If this occurs, we will consider alternate sources of funding, including other forms of off-balance sheet as well as on-balance sheet financing, or discontinue the origination of premium finance agreements. Furthermore, if there were adverse bank, regulatory, tax, or accounting rule changes, our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles could be affected.  

 PEPS I  

 In 2001, we sold the vast majority of our LP portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company owned by us (49%) and by a charitable trust, which we do not control (51%). We do not include PEPS I's assets and liabilities and operations in our consolidated financial statements.  

 In 2001, PEPS I:    

sold approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities to unaffiliated third parties and   

paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities.   

 As part of this transaction, we are required to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities from PEPS I in an amount equal to the unfunded LP commitments as they are requested. These fixed-maturity securities are rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2008, the unfunded commitments amounted to $42 million. These commitments have specific expiration dates, and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments.  

 We received income distributions from our preferred investment in PEPS I as follows:    

during 2008, $32 million, which is included in investment income, a decrease of $29 million from 2007.   

Beginning in 2007, PEPS I had redeemed or collateralized all of its debt, and as a result, began to pay preferred income distributions.   

Before 2007, the income distributions we received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on various PEPS I debt instruments.   

 Whether we receive additional preferred returns will depend on the performance of the LP interests underlying PEPS I, which we expect to vary from period to period. We do not control the timing of the distributions.  

 We derive the estimated fair value of our $101 million preferred stock investments in PEPS I primarily from valuations received from the general partners of the LP interest held by PEPS I.  

 Contractual Obligations  

 The following table:    

summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2008, and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations in cash, and   

reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings.   

59 

 We have provided additional details about some of these obligations in our notes to the financial statements (in millions):    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Included in purchase obligations are contracts for various information technology contracts. As of December 31, 2008, we can exit these obligations for termination payments of $86 million. However, given the nature of these contracts, we have included them in our contractual obligations table. 

(2)Also included in purchase obligations is a $309 million contract for claims outsourcing in the U.K. We can exit this obligation after 2013 for approximately $29 million. 

(3)Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. 

(4)Excludes $69 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements will be made. 

(5)The contractual obligations for the property and casualty insurance underwriting operations are for policy and contract claims.
