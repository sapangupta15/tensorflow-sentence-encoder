 BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OVERVIEW   

 Strategy and Goals  

 Our vision is to be the premier low-cost supplier of transportation fuels in the refining and marketing business in our markets, providing value for our customers while delivering industry leading returns for our shareholders and conducting ourselves responsibly in the communities in which we operate. To achieve these goals we are pursuing the following strategic priorities:  

       improve operational efficiency and effectiveness by focusing on safety and reliability, system improvements and cost leadership;   

       drive commercial excellence by strengthening our supply and trading activities to provide additional value to the business;   

       strengthen our financial position by exercising capital discipline and focusing on improving our liquidity; and   

       capture value-driven growth through a focus on our logistics assets and growing our marketing business.    

 During 2010, our goals were focused on optimizing cash flows from operations by improving our capture of available margins, devoting capital to income improvement projects, lowering administrative costs and lowering our energy and maintenance costs. Relative to these goals, during 2010 we:  

       improved our gross refining margin by $191 million and improved our cash balance approximately $235 million as a result of our capital and non-capital initiatives to lower transportation and feedstock costs, increase product margins and improve refinery yields;   

       funded our capital spending of $287 million through cash flows from operations of $385 million of which approximately 10% was devoted to income improvement projects; and   

       significantly reduced our employee benefit obligation by $207 million primarily through changes to our post-retirement life, medical and pension benefit programs.    

 Tesoro Logistics LP  

 On January 4, 2011, Tesoro Logistics LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesoro Corporation, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC in connection with a proposed initial public offering of its common units representing limited partner interests. On February 9, 2011, Tesoro Logistics LP filed an amendment to the initial Form S-1 on Form S-1/A. The number of common units to be offered and the price range for the offering have not yet been determined. Tesoro Logistics LP was formed by Tesoro Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, Tesoro Logistics LPs initial assets will consist of a crude oil gathering system in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area, eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah.   

 31   
 At the date of this report, the registration statement is not effective. The completion of the offering is subject to numerous conditions, including market conditions, and we can provide no assurance that it will be successfully completed. The securities offered under the registration statement may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective. The information contained in this Form 10-K with respect to this offering shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities.  

 Tesoro Panama Company Sociedad Anonima (TPSA)  

 As part of our business strategy, we formed TPSA to use our leased pipeline and tank facilities in Panama by enhancing strategic partnerships, developing economies of scale around freight and storage opportunities, providing discretionary crude oil trading, expanding global commercial relationships and evaluating opportunities to source crude from alternative supply markets. TPSA is:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The TPSA Agreement with Gunvor allocates and delegates a portion of Gunvors rights, duties, and obligations set forth in Gunvors TSA agreement with PTP to TPSA. TPSA has leased access to, and is obligated for, pipeline capacity of more than 100 Mbpd and tank capacity of approximately 4.4 million barrels. In October 2010, TPSA entered into a revolving credit agreement which provides for an uncommitted, secured revolving credit facility (TPSA Revolving Credit Facility). The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to the Company, meaning only TPSA is liable for any borrowings or interest under this credit agreement.  

 Industry Overview  

 Our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is also affected by changes in economic conditions. Product values and crude oil costs are set by the market and are outside of the control of independent refiners.  

 Crude Oil Price and Product Margin Analysis  

 The overall U.S. economy, including that of the West Coast, has shown signs of improvement, though these improvements have not consistently translated into stronger demand for refined products. Measures of commercial activity that are correlated with oil demand showed improvement, particularly in the second half of 2010. Container traffic at the five largest West Coast ports recovered to their 2007 levels in August 2010 and have remained above 2008 levels since May 2010. In 2010, self-reported available seat miles at the largest U.S.-flagged air carriers were 1.1% higher than the previous year, with year-on-year growth for the second half of 2010 of 3.7%.  

 U.S. Gross Domestic Product continues to grow. However, the recovery to date has been without an accompanying improvement in the labor sector as unemployment remains above 9%. Events in other countries during 2010 affected regional supply and demand fundamentals, such as outages at refineries in Chile and Mexico during the first half of the year. The effect of these events was relatively short-lived but provided upward pressure on margins by decreasing excess refinery capacity.   

 32   
 The following table depicts average key crude oil pricing and West Coast benchmark product margins for 2010 and 2009:  

 Improved West Coast distillate supply and demand fundamentals led to improved diesel margins in 2010 as compared to 2009. During 2010, U.S. West Coast benchmark diesel fuel margins increased by approximately 37% due to strengthening commercial activity, diesel exports and refinery outages. However, West Coast gasoline margins decreased in 2010 by 13% over 2009 primarily due to continued lower demand, increased alternative fuel supply and spare refining capacity.  

 Outlook  

 The slow recovery of the global and domestic economies, coupled with persistent high unemployment in the U.S. is expected to continue to negatively impact demand for refined products. The impact of reduced demand has been compounded by excess global refining capacity and historically high inventory levels. These conditions have continued to put pressure on refined product margins. Recently, we have seen improvements in regional margins and expect margins to be slightly higher in 2011 as compared to 2010.  

 In addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the U.S. These factors include:

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

 A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.  

 Summary  

 Our net loss in 2010 was $29 million ($0.21 per diluted share) compared with a net loss of $140 million ($1.01 per diluted share) in 2009. The increase in net earnings of $0.80 per diluted share was primarily due to the following:  

       contribution from our capital and non-capital initiative program during 2010 which increased our overall margin through reduced transportation and feedstock costs, increased product margins, and improved refinery yields;   

       increased gross refining margins due to local crude discounts and improved distillate margins partially offset by weaker gasoline margins;   

       a $48 million gain from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses;   

       a $39 million decrease in losses on our derivative instruments;   

       improved contribution of $14 million from our retail marketing segment; and   

       a goodwill write-off of $10 million in 2010 compared to $43 million in 2009.    

 The increase in net earnings during 2010 relative to 2009 was partially offset by the following:  

       lower throughput primarily from the temporary shut-down of processing at our Washington refinery and completion of scheduled refinery turnarounds at several of our other refineries. The gross margin impact of the temporary shut-down at the Washington refinery was partially offset by the receipt of $55 million in business interruption insurance recoveries;   

       a $51 million increase in incentive and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in stock based compensation is related to our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock options which increased primarily as a result of increases in Tesoro stock prices during 2010 as compared to 2009;   

       a reduction in cost of sales of $69 million resulting from a LIFO liquidation benefit during 2009; and   

       additional operating expenses of $27 million directly related to the April 2, 2010, incident at our Washington refinery, partially offset by $12 million in property insurance recoveries.    

 Our net loss in 2009 was $140 million ($1.01 per diluted share) compared with net earnings of $278 million ($2.00 per diluted share) in 2008. The decrease in net earnings of $3.01 per diluted share was primarily due to the following:

 Refining Segment  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (f)    Consolidated gross refining margin combines gross refining margin for each of our regions adjusted for other amounts not directly attributable to a specific region. These amounts resulted in an increase of $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and an increase of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput times gross refining margin per barrel.  

  (g)    Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.97, $1.69, and $1.40 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

  (h)    Loss on asset disposals and impairments is included in refining segment operating income but excluded from the regional operating costs per barrel. Includes goodwill write-offs related to two separate reporting units for $10 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and impairment charges related to refining equipment at our Los Angeles refinery of $20 million and $12 million, respectively.  

  (i)    Includes a $36 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees.  

  (j)    Sources of total refined product sales included refined products manufactured at the refineries and refined products purchased from third-parties. The total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products.   

 36   
  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (k)    We experienced reduced throughput due to scheduled turnarounds at our Hawaii, North Dakota, Golden Eagle and Utah refineries in 2010. We also temporarily shut-down processing at the Washington refinery beginning in April 2010, and resumed operations at planned rates in November 2010. We experienced reduced throughput due to scheduled turnarounds at our Alaska and Golden Eagle refineries, unscheduled downtime at our Los Angeles refinery and scheduled maintenance at our Washington refinery during 2009, and scheduled turnarounds at the Golden Eagle and Washington refineries during 2008.   

 2010 Compared to 2009  

 Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased by $200 million, or 364% to $255 million during 2010 as compared to $55 million during 2009. The increase primarily reflects improved total gross refining margins of $191 million during the year. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase of $10 million in manufacturing and other operating expenses.  

 Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased by $2.36 per barrel, or 27%, to $11.26 per barrel in 2010 as compared to $8.90 per barrel in 2009, primarily due to significantly higher industry diesel fuel margins and our initiatives to improve our margin capture rates, partially offset by lower industry margins for gasoline. Industry diesel fuel margins in the U.S. West Coast region increased, primarily due to strong exports and increased manufacturing activity nationwide. Industry gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 reflecting poor global demand and higher inventories resulting from high domestic unemployment rates.  

 During 2010, we reduced our transportation and feedstock costs, realized better refinery yields and improved margins on finished products, which improved consolidated gross margin. Our California refineries benefited from improved product yields and increased throughput of discounted foreign heavy crude oils as these refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils (72% of total refining throughput during 2010). In addition, we experienced higher gross refining margins at our Mid-Continent refineries due to increased use of discounted local crudes and downtime at other refineries in the region. See Industry Overview for additional information on the increase in industry diesel margins and the decrease in industry gasoline margins during 2010.   

 37   
 We periodically use non-trading derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products. We may also use non-trading derivative instruments to manage price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels. Gains or losses associated with our derivative instruments are included in gross refining margin. Our losses totaled $29 million during 2010 versus $68 million during 2009. Crude prices increased significantly during 2009 compared to marginal increases during 2010. This pricing difference and lower price volatility improved derivative results during 2010.  

 Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput declined 69 Mbpd, or 13%, to 480 Mbpd during 2010 as compared to 549 Mbpd during 2009 primarily due to the following:  

       the temporary shutdown of processing at the Washington refinery subsequent to the April 2, 2010, naphtha hydrotreater fire. The gross margin impact of the reduced throughput was partially offset by $55 million in business interruption insurance recoveries recorded as an offset to cost of sales;   

       scheduled turnarounds at our Hawaii, North Dakota, Golden Eagle and Utah refineries.    

 Total refining throughput during 2009 was impacted by scheduled turnarounds at our Alaska and Golden Eagle refineries, scheduled maintenance at our Washington refinery and unscheduled downtime at the Los Angeles refinery.  

 Refined Products Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $3.3 billion, or 21%, to $19.0 billion in 2010 as compared to $15.7 billion in 2009, primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices, partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price increased $18.86 per barrel, or 26%, to $91.03 per barrel in 2010 as compared to $72.17 in 2009, due to higher average crude oil prices placing upward pressure on product prices. Total refined product sales decreased by 24 Mbpd, or 4%, to 572 Mbpd in 2010 as compared to 596 Mbpd in 2009, primarily reflecting lower product demand.  

 Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average cost of sales increased by $17.73 per barrel, or 27%, to $82.66 per barrel during 2010 as compared to $64.93 during 2009, reflecting higher average crude oil prices. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $10 million, or 1%, to $1.3 billion in 2010, primarily due to $15 million in charges, net of property insurance recoveries, directly related to the April 2, 2010, incident at the Washington refinery coupled with higher natural gas costs at our California refineries, partially offset by a $32 million gain in operating expenses from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits. Refining depreciation and amortization expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses had nominal changes in 2010 with an increase of $6 million and decrease of $2 million, respectively.  

 Loss on Asset Disposals and Impairments. Loss on asset disposals decreased by $23 million, or 32%, primarily due to a decrease in the goodwill write-offs of $33 million, partially offset by an increase in refining equipment impairment charges at our Los Angeles refinery of $8 million. The 2010 goodwill write-off of $10 million was a result of an increase in the net book value of our Hawaii refinery reporting unit compared to a decrease in its fair value resulting from decreases in forecasted cash flows. For further discussion, see Note E to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The $20 million loss on asset disposals at our Los Angeles refinery in 2010 relates to the deferral of a capital project at our Los Angeles refinery, which resulted in a write-down to fair value of equipment specifically manufactured and uniquely configured for the project.  

 2009 Compared to 2008  

 Overview. Operating income for our refining segment decreased by $572 million, or 91%, to $55 million during 2009 as compared to $627 million during 2008. The decrease primarily reflects a lower gross refining margin partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing and other operating expenses of $149 million. The impact of a lower per barrel gross refining margin decreased total gross refining margins by $723 million during the year. Operating income included a goodwill write-off of $43 million during 2009 and a bad debt charge of $91 million during 2008. Our operating income in both periods benefited from a reduction in cost of sales from decreasing LIFO inventory layers acquired at lower per-barrel costs. These inventory reductions resulted in operating income improvements of $69 million during 2009 and $138 million during 2008.   

 38   
 Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel decreased by $2.60 per barrel, or 23%, to $8.90 per barrel in 2009 as compared to $11.50 per barrel in 2008, due to significantly lower industry diesel fuel and jet fuel margins, partially offset by higher industry margins for gasoline and heavy products. The decrease in industry diesel fuel margins throughout 2009 reflected lower global demand and significantly higher U.S. inventories. Industry gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast improved in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to heavy scheduled and unscheduled industry downtime and lower average gasoline inventories. Our California region was negatively impacted by a reduction in heavy and light crude oil price differentials that reduced gross refining margin during 2009, because our California refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils (66% of total refining throughput during 2009).  

 Our derivative losses totaled $68 million during 2009 versus $107 million during 2008. The decrease in our losses reflected the impact of changing our hedging strategy. During the 2008 second quarter, we closed the majority of our crude oil derivative positions associated with our long haul strategy that matched the price of long haul crude oils to crude oil prices on the day of processing.  

 Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput declined 46 Mbpd, or 8%, to 549 Mbpd during 2009 as compared to 595 Mbpd during 2008, primarily due to matching production to lower demand and the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Total refining throughput during 2008 was impacted by turnarounds at our Golden Eagle and Washington refineries.  

 Refined Products Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products decreased $11.1 billion, or 41%, to $15.7 billion in 2009 as compared to $26.8 billion in 2008, primarily due to significantly lower average refined product sales prices and lower refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price decreased $39.89 per barrel, or 36% to $72.17 per barrel in 2009 as compared to $112.06 per barrel in 2008, reflecting lower product demand and lower average crude oil prices. Total refined product sales decreased 60 Mbpd, or 9%, to 596 Mbpd in 2009 as compared to 656 Mbpd in 2008, primarily due to lower product demand.  

 Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average cost of sales decreased $37.44, or 37%, to $64.93 per barrel during 2009 as compared to $102.37 per barrel during 2008, reflecting significantly lower average crude oil prices. Manufacturing and other operating expenses decreased $149 million, or 11%, to $1.3 billion in 2009 as compared to $1.4 billion in 2008, due to lower natural gas utility costs and lower refining throughput. Depreciation and amortization increased by $33 million, or 10%, to $359 million during 2009 as compared to $326 million during 2008, reflecting the completion of several capital projects during 2008, including the $600 million delayed coker at the Golden Eagle refinery. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs of $95 million, or 75%, from 2008 is related to a $91 million bad debt charge in 2008. The increase of $60 million in loss on asset disposals and impairments primarily reflects a goodwill write-off of $43 million and a net termination charge of $12 million related to a cancelled purchase of equipment associated with a capital project at our Los Angeles refinery. The equipment purchase was cancelled as we re-evaluated the scope and timing of the project.   

 39   
 Retail Segment  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel margin per gallon; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate fuel margin per gallon by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes. Investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income and revenues or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with US GAAP.  

  (b)    Includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our refining segment at prices which approximate market.  

  (c)    Includes impairment charges during 2008 related to the closure of 42 Mirastar retail stations and a potential sale of 20 retail stations.   

 2010 Compared to 2009  

 Operating Income. Our retail segment operating income increased $14 million, or 17% to $97 million during 2010 as compared to $83 million during 2009 due to increased fuel sale volumes and lower expenses. Fuel gross margins increased $6 million as retail fuel margin per barrel remained consistent at $0.21 per gallon with an increase in fuel sales volume of 7 million gallons. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margins also had a slight    

 40   
 increase of $2 million resulting from higher average 2010 retail station counts. As a result, total gross margins increased $8 million, or 2%, to $358 million in 2010 as compared to $350 million in 2009.  

 Fuel sale revenues increased $583 million, or 19%, to $3.6 billion in 2010 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2009, reflecting significantly higher average sales prices and a minor increase in fuel sales volumes. Cost of sales increased from 2009 due to higher prices for purchased fuel. Our other expenses, excluding the loss on asset disposals and impairments, decreased by $9 million, or 3%, to $255 million during 2010 as compared to $264 million during 2009 primarily due to cost savings from the elimination of postretirement life insurance for current and future retirees of $4 million.  

 2009 Compared to 2008  

 Operating Income. Our retail segment operating income increased $37 million, or 80%, to $83 million during 2009 as compared to $46 million in 2008 reflecting lower expenses partially offset by lower gross margins. Operating income during 2008 included impairment charges of $29 million related to closing 42 Mirastar retail stations and a write-down of 20 other retail stations associated with a potential sale. Total gross margins decreased $14 million, or 4%, to $350 million in 2009 as compared to $364 million in 2008, reflecting lower sales volumes due to lower gasoline demand and a lower average retail station count. The decrease in average retail station count from 2008 related to closing the 42 Mirastar retail stations.  

 Fuel sale revenues decreased $1.2 billion, or 28%, to $3.0 billion in 2009, from $4.2 billion in 2008, reflecting significantly lower sales prices and decreased fuel sales volumes. Cost of sales decreased from 2008 due to lower prices for purchased fuel. Our other expenses, excluding the loss on asset disposals and impairments, decreased by $25 million, or 9%, to $264 million during 2009 as compared to $289 million during 2008 reflecting a decrease of 36 average retail stations.  

 Consolidated Results of Operations  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $21 million or 10% to $242 million in 2010 from $221 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher stock prices on stock-based compensation expense recorded for our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock options which increased by $15 million and $4 million, respectively. Our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock options are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period. In addition, incentive compensation costs increased by $13 million during 2010. The increase in 2010 was partially offset by a $15 million gain recognized on the elimination of the postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees. Of this gain $4 million, $2 million and $9 million relate to refining, retail and corporate, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $104 million or 32% to $221 million in 2009 from $325 million in 2008 primarily due to a $91 million bad debt charge recorded in 2008.  

 Interest and Financing Costs. Interest and financing cost increased $27 million or 21% to $157 million in 2010 from $130 million in 2009 primarily due to additional interest expense recognized in 2010 as a result of the issuance of our $300 million senior notes in June 2009 and due to increases in our letter of credit fees resulting from the February 2010 amendment to the Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility (Revolving Credit Facility). Interest and financing costs increased $19 million or 17% to $130 million in 2009 from $111 million in 2008 due to the issuance of our $300 million senior notes in June 2009, partially offset by lower outstanding revolver borrowings.  

 Other Income (Expense). We recorded other expense of $13 million in 2010 primarily as a result of a summary judgment award of $16 million granted in late 2010 related to Chevrons assertion that it was entitled to a share of our 2008 refund from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). In 2008, we recorded $50 million of other income related to a refund we received from TAPS in connection with rulings made by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska concerning our protest of intrastate pipeline rates.  

 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense was $4 million in 2010 compared to a benefit of $48 million in 2009 and an expense of $151 million in 2008. The combined federal and state effective tax rates were (16%), 26% and 35% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $4 million of tax expense in 2010 included a $7 million charge relating to the passage of the 2010 health care legislation. The health care legislation made retiree prescription health care costs non-deductible to the extent of Medicare prescription heath care subsidies received after 2012.   

 41   
 The 2009 tax benefit was reduced by $17 million relating to a goodwill write-off for which there was no corresponding tax basis. The 2008 tax expense benefited from the favorable settlement of federal tax audits for the years 1996 through 2005.   

 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY   

 Overview  

 We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 30 for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit facilities and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.  

 Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit. We ended 2010 with $648 million of cash and cash equivalents, no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $150 million in borrowings under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility. Further, we had borrowing ability under our credit agreements as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Borrowing base is the lesser of the amount of the periodically adjusted borrowing base or the agreements total capacity   

 We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements. We continue to focus on maximizing our available cash through the management of working capital, capital expenditures and operating expenses.  

 Credit Facilities  

 Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility  

 We amended our Revolving Credit Facility in February 2010. Modifications included: lowering the minimum required tangible net worth, the purchase or sale of certain assets is no longer subject to the fixed charge coverage ratio, the covenant permitting additional unsecured indebtedness increased the allowable amount of unsecured indebtedness, letters of credit allowed under separate letter of credit agreements are no longer subject to a cap, the applicable margin was adjusted and the annual rate of commitment fees for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was lowered.  

 Our Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes impose various restrictions and covenants that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity capital, pay cash dividends, or repurchase stock. The indentures for our senior notes contain covenants and restrictions which are customary for notes of this nature. These covenants and restrictions limit, among other things, our ability to:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 42   
  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We have a default covenant, which requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. We were in compliance with the tangible net worth requirement for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active domestic subsidiaries and allows up to $100 million of restricted payments during any four-quarter period subject to credit availability exceeding 20% of the borrowing base.  

 At December 31, 2010, our Revolving Credit Facility provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base of approximately $2.2 billion (based upon an Alaska North Slope crude oil price of $84 per barrel), consisting of Tesoros eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories, net of the standard reserve as defined, or the Revolving Credit Facilitys total capacity of $1.86 billion. The total capacity can be further increased from $1.86 billion up to $2.0 billion.  

 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2010), or a Eurodollar rate (0.26% at December 31, 2010) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin at December 31, 2010, was 2.25% in the case of the Eurodollar rate, but varies based upon our Revolving Credit Facilitys credit availability and credit ratings. Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at an annual rate tied to the applicable margin described above (2.25% at December 31, 2010). We also incur commitment fees for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at an annual rate of 0.50% as of December 31, 2010. Our Revolving Credit Facility expires in May 2012.  

 Letter of Credit Agreements  

 The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit agreements for foreign crude oil purchases. At December 31, 2010, we had three separate letter of credit agreements. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the petroleum inventories for which they are issued. The letter of credit agreements may be terminated by either party, at any time.  

 TPSA Revolving Credit Facility  

 On October 18, 2010, TPSA, a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Tesoro, entered into a 364-day uncommitted, secured revolving credit agreement. TPSA is an excluded and unrestricted subsidiary from Tesoros Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and outstanding indentures. The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro and is guaranteed by TPSAs assets. The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility includes two uncommitted facilities, which provide for revolving borrowings (Revolving Borrowings), swing line loans and daylight overdraft loans (TPSA Loans) and letters of credit. Our total capacity under the TPSA facilities can be further increased up to $700 million provided the facilities maximum amounts do not exceed $550 million and $350 million, respectively.  

 Revolving Borrowings bear interest at a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin (2.75% as of December 31, 2010), or an alternative base rate (3.25% as of December 31, 2010) plus an applicable margin (1.75% as of December 31, 2010). TPSA Loans bear interest at the alternative base rate plus the applicable margin plus 0.50% per annum.  

 At December 31, 2010, our TPSA Revolving Credit Facility provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base consisting of TPSA eligible receivables and petroleum inventories, net of reserves or the agreements capacity based on the new worth of TPSA. As of December 31, 2010 TPSAs net worth limited the facility to a maximum capacity of $350 million.  

 The TPSA Revolving Credit Facility contains certain default covenants and conditions relative to TPSAs financial results that, among other things, limit TPSAs ability to incur indebtedness or carry inventory levels above certain thresholds. TPSA is also required to maintain specified levels of adjusted tangible net worth (as defined) and adjusted net working capital (as defined). We were in compliance with all of the TPSA Revolving Credit Facilitys covenants and conditions as of December 31, 2010.   

 43   
 Capitalization  

 Our capital structure at December 31, 2010 was comprised of (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 At December 31, 2010, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 38%, compared to 37% at year-end 2009, reflecting $150 million of borrowings outstanding on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility.  

 Cash Dividends  

 We did not pay any cash dividends during 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $0.35 per share and $0.40 per share, respectively.  

 Cash Flow Summary  

 Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2010 Compared to 2009  

 Net cash from operating activities decreased $278 million, or 42%, to $385 million in 2010 as compared to $663 million in 2009 primarily due to higher working capital requirements partially offset by a decrease in net losses for the period. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $141 million, or 32% to $295 million in 2010 as compared to $436 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities decreased $21 million or 13% to $145 million in 2010 from $166 million in 2009 primarily due to $150 million in net borrowings under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility in 2010 offset by net proceeds on our senior note issuance of $282 million, net repayments on our revolver of $66 million and dividend payments of $49 million in 2009.  

 Working capital (excluding cash) was a source of $137 million in cash for the year ending December 31, 2010, primarily related to a run-up in crude and product prices towards the end of the year. We collect our receivables approximately three times faster than we pay our payables, the majority of which settle on the 20th of the month following the date of crude delivery. In a period of rising crude oil and product prices, we collect higher product prices sooner than we pay for more expensive crude purchases. Inventories increased by approximately seven million barrels from December 31, 2009. This was offset by corresponding increases in accounts payable and current maturities of long-term debt in the statement of consolidated cash flows.   

 44   
 2009 Compared to 2008  

 Net cash from operating activities decreased $53 million, or 7%, to $663 million in 2009 as compared to $716 million in 2008 primarily due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by lower working capital requirements. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $174 million, or 29%, to $436 million in 2009 as compared to $610 million in 2008 primarily as a result of decreased capital expenditures. Net cash from (used in) financing activities increased $275 million or 252% to $166 million in 2009 from $(109) million in 2008 primarily due to the net proceeds from our senior notes issuance partially offset by repayments on our revolver and dividend payments.  

 Gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled $418 million, and we repaid $484 million in borrowings during 2009. Working capital (excluding cash) decreased $264 million at December 31, 2009 from $185 million at December 31, 2008, as payables increased by a larger amount than both receivables and inventories due to higher crude oil prices at year end. Inventories decreased by approximately 4 million barrels from December 31, 2008 reflecting our initiatives to optimize working capital and matching production to lower product demand.  

 Capital Expenditures  

 Our capital budget for 2011 is $380 million. Our capital spending during 2010 was $287 million compared to our 2010 capital budget of $470 million. Our 2011 budgeted and 2010 actual capital spending amounts are comprised of the following project categories at December 31, 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The capital spending plans for 2011 reflect the Companys strategic priorities including continued focus on safety and reliability and greater focus on value-driven growth. Sustaining capital expenditures, primarily repairs and maintenance not related to turnaround activity, are expected to remain at about 30% of our total capital expenditures in 2011. Spending on income improvement projects is expected to increase from 10% of all capital dollars to 30% in 2011 as the company puts greater focus on these value-added projects which are expected to improve yields, reduce costs and expand our infrastructure. Regulatory spending as a percent of total spending declines though total dollars expected to be spent remains relatively constant. See Business Strategy and Overview and Environmental Capital Expenditures for additional information.  

 Refinery Turnaround Spending  

 Our 2011 budget for refinery turnarounds and catalyst is $160 million. The turnaround spending is primarily at our Golden Eagle and Los Angeles refineries. Refining throughput and yields in 2011 will be affected by these turnarounds. During 2010, we spent $140 million for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, primarily at our Utah, Golden Eagle, North Dakota and Hawaii refineries.   

 45   
 Long-Term Commitments  

 Contractual Commitments  

 We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes J and N to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings.  

  (b)    Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.  

  (c)    Represents an estimate of our short-term and long-term contractual purchase commitments for crude oil, with remaining terms ranging from six months to five years. Prices under these term agreements fluctuate due to market-responsive pricing provisions. To estimate our annual commitments under these contracts, we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices by crude oil type as of December 31, 2010, with prices ranging from $83 per barrel to $91 per barrel, and volumes based on the contracts minimum purchase requirements. We also purchase additional crude oil under short-term renewable contracts and in the spot market, which is not included in the table above.  

  (d)    Represents primarily long-term commitments for the transportation of crude oil and refined products as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contracts minimum volume requirements.  

  (e)    Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.  

  (f)    We have included the future estimated benefit payments for our defined pension plans and other postretirement benefits as these obligations represent the majority of our other noncurrent liabilities. See Note M to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information.   

 With the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Note I and Note K, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

 In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits, with the exception of amounts classified as current, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded $22 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities, $1 million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet, from the contractual commitments table above. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $11 million at December 31, 2010, $1 million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet. See Note L to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.   

 46   
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Other than our leasing arrangements described in Note N to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.  

 Environmental and Other Matters  

 We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.  

 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls, or make other modifications to certain emission sources.  

 Future expenditures may be required to comply with proposed regulations under the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our refineries, tank farms, pipelines, operating retail stations, closed retail stations operating refined products terminals and closed refined products terminals. The impact of these legislative and regulatory developments, including any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program or low carbon fuel standards, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions on our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  

 In December 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that created a second renewable fuels standard (RFS2). This standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 12.95 billion gallons in 2010, 13.95 billion gallons in 2011 and rise to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture. In the near term, the RFS2 presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol, alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries. Additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels.  

 In California, Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and a low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) to achieve emission reduction targets. The LCFS became effective in January 2010 and requires a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. Final regulations for all other aspects of AB 32, including cap and trade requirements, are being developed by CARB, will take effect in 2012, and will be fully implemented by 2020. The implementation and implications of AB 32 will take many years to realize, and we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  

 In 2009, the EPA proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The first of these regulations finalized on April 1, 2010, sets standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars. It could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels. In addition, other proposed regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold. The resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries.  

 We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result in increased expenditures in the future. We are also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities. We believe that resolution of any such claim(s) would not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We believe it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $12 million in the next twelve months through settlements or other conclusions, primarily regarding state tax issues.   

 47   
 Environmental Liabilities  

 We are, and expect to continue, incurring expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled $108 million and $106 million, respectively. Our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments and it is possible that our estimates will change and additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available.  

 We received $58.5 million in a settlement with a prior owner of our Golden Eagle refinery in 2007 in exchange for assuming responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to August 2000. These environmental liabilities totaled $62 million and $73 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the Golden Eagle refinery. Therefore, it is possible that we will identify additional remediation costs as more information becomes available. We have filed insurance claims under environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of the $50 million in self-insurance. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been reduced for possible insurance recoveries.  

 We are continuing to investigate conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Golden Eagle refinery. This investigation is driven by an order from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board that names us as well as two previous owners of the Golden Eagle refinery. Costs to investigate these conditions are included in our environmental accruals. We cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order, but we believe it will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 Washington Refinery Fire  

 On April 2, 2010, the naphtha hydrotreater unit at our Washington refinery was involved in a fire, which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable. Subsequent to the incident, refinery processing was temporarily shut down until after the unit reconstruction was completed. The Washington refinery resumed operations at planned rates in November 2010.  

 In February 2011, Tesoro Corporation, Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company and other defendants were named in a lawsuit brought by the estates and families of six of the seven fatally injured employees arising from the April 2, 2010 Washington refinery incident. In addition, a third-party propane truck driver has alleged damages in the lawsuit. The lawsuit includes allegations of negligence, premises liability, strict liability, product liability and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The Company believes that it has defenses to the allegations contained in the lawsuit. The case of Donald and Peggy Zimmerman et al. v. Tesoro Corporation and Tesoro Refining and Marketing et al. is proceeding in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, Skagit County. We are still evaluating the allegations contained in the lawsuit, however we believe that the outcome will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position.  

 We maintain comprehensive property (including business interruption), workers compensation, and general liability insurance policies with significant loss limits. Our business interruption insurance deductible is satisfied after we have exceeded both 60 days of operational disruption and $25 million in losses primarily based on the operating plan that existed prior to the incident. Our property damage insurance has a $10 million deductible. We have filed business interruption insurance claims and property damage claims related to this incident.  

 During 2010, we collected $55 million in business interruption insurance recoveries that relate to downtime from April 2010 to August 2010, which were recorded as an offset to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. We have filed additional business interruption insurance claims and expect to settle remaining matters in the first half of 2011. We also filed claims for $22 million in property damages and recorded $12 million in property insurance recoveries, net of the $10 million deductible. These amounts were recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not believe that this tragic incident will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 Other Matters  

 In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable. As a result, we have not established accruals for these matters. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.   

 48   
 During 2009, Chevron filed a lawsuit against us claiming they are entitled to a share of the refunds we received in 2008 from the owners of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We received $50 million in 2008, net of contingent legal fees, for excessive intrastate rates charged by TAPS during 1997 though 2000, and the period of 2001 through June 2003. Chevron is asserting that it is entitled to a share of its portion of the refunds for retroactive price adjustments under our previous crude oil contracts with them. In September 2010, the trial court judge granted Chevrons motion for summary judgment and awarded them $16 million. We disagree with the trial court and have appealed the decision to the Alaska Supreme Court in which the proceeding is now pending. We have established an accrual for this matter and believe that the outcome will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position.  

 We are a defendant, along with other manufacturing, supply and marketing defendants, in six lawsuits alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. We were served with the sixth lawsuit in April 2010. The defendants are being sued for having manufactured MTBE and having manufactured, supplied and distributed gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs in the six cases, all in California, are municipalities and governmental authorities. The plaintiffs allege, in part, that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees. We intend to vigorously assert our defenses against these claims.  

 On February 5, 2010, the EPA filed suit against us alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and corresponding regulatory requirements concerning the testing and reporting of transportation fuels and fuel additives. In February 2009, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA for the alleged violations arising from a compliance review conducted by the EPA in 2006 for the years 2003 through the time of the review in 2006. We are discussing the alleged violations contained in the suit with the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice and have not established an accrual for this matter. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Financial Reform Act of 2010, was signed into law. Key provisions of the act require that standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements. These requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting, capital, and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities. Final rules on provisions in the legislation will be established and will take effect twelve months after the date of enactment. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legislation, new regulations in this area may result in increased hedging costs and cash collateral requirements, and ultimately affect liquidity and working capital requirements.  

 Prior to this year, we received two NOVs from the EPA for the Washington refinery alleging that prior to our acquisition of the refinery, certain modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the Clean Air Act. We have investigated the allegations and believe we have defenses to the allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves.  

 Prior to this year, we received a NOV from the EPA concerning our Utah refinery alleging certain violations of the Clean Air Act at the refinery beginning in 2004. We have investigated the allegations contained in the NOV and sent the EPA additional information in 2009.  

 Environmental Capital Expenditures  

 The EPA issued regulations in February 2007 that require the reduction of benzene in gasoline. We spent $62 million in 2010, and plan to spend an additional $89 million through 2013 at five of our refineries to comply with the regulations. Our California refineries will not require capital spending to meet the benzene reduction standards.  

 We have evaluated alternative projects for wharves at our Golden Eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the State of California in February 2006 and expect a commercial transaction could significantly reduce capital spending requirements. We are currently working with a counterparty on this agreement. Based on the updated alternatives, we expect to spend $15 million through 2013. The timing of these projects is being evaluated and is subject to change.   

 49   
 Regulations issued by Californias South Coast Air Quality Management District require the emission of nitrogen oxides to be initially reduced in 2011 at our Los Angeles refinery. Currently, we plan to meet this requirement by implementing operational changes, small capital projects and the continued management of our emissions credits. We do not expect significant environmental capital expenditures in future years to satisfy these reductions.  

 Other projects at our Los Angeles refinery include replacing underground pipelines with above-ground pipelines to comply with an order from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. We spent $3 million in 2010, and do not expect to spend significant environmental capital in future years to comply with these orders.  

 We spent approximately $12 million to reconfigure and replace above-ground storage tank systems at our Golden Eagle refinery during 2010 to comply with a California Regional Water Quality Board Order. We do not expect significant environmental capital expenditures in future years to comply with this order.  

 We spent $13 million in 2010 to install equipment in the first quarter at our Golden Eagle refinery to eliminate the use of atmospheric blowdown towers as emergency relief systems.  

 We were required under a consent decree with the EPA to reduce air emissions at our North Dakota and Utah refineries. We spent $5 million in 2010 to install emission controls for nitrogen oxides on boilers and heaters at these refineries. We do not expect significant environmental capital expenditures in future years to comply with this order.  

 The cost estimates for the environmental projects described above are subject to further review and analysis and include estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs.  

 Pension Funding  

 We provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees, with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 7.5% as of December 31, 2010, and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a return of $30 million in 2010 and a return of $34 million in 2009. Based on a 5.55% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2010, the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 52% of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of 2010. At January 1, 2010 the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations) was 97%. Although Tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in 2010, we voluntarily contributed $34 million to improve the funded status of the plan. We currently are not required to fund any contributions in 2011 and continue to evaluate our expected 2011 voluntary contributions. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, discount rates, employee demographics, regulatory environments and other factors. See Note M to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.  

 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our accounting policies are described in Note A to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.  

 Receivables  Our trade receivables are stated at their invoiced amounts, less an allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts. We monitor the credit and payment experience of our customers and manage our loss exposure through our credit policies and procedures. The estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our general loss experience and identified loss exposures on individual accounts. Actual losses could vary from estimates as global economic conditions and the related credit environment could change.  

 Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles  We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental requirements could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and    

 50   
 amortization. We evaluate these assets for potential impairment when an asset disposition is probable or when there are indicators of impairment (for example, current period operating losses combined with a history of operating losses or a temporary shutdown of a refinery) and, if so, assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is equal to the amount by which the assets net book value exceeds its fair market value. Fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. At December 31, 2010, we evaluated certain of our refineries for potential impairment and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary.  

 Goodwill  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had goodwill of $36 million and $46 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist for the underlying assets. We review the recorded value of our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value, including the related goodwill, of that reporting unit. We use an income approach based on the present value of expected net cash flows and a market approach based on recent sales transactions and current stock prices to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units.  

 Market conditions associated with the economic recession, including excess product inventories and rising crude oil costs, reduced current period and forecasted earnings within our business and industry as well as quoted market prices for comparable company common stocks and refinery sales transactions. Decreased forecasted cash flows and quoted market prices reduced our estimated fair value below carrying value at certain of our refining reporting units resulting in a goodwill write-off of $10 million and $43 million, for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively. The estimated fair value of our largest remaining reporting unit with goodwill of approximately $30 million significantly exceeded its carrying value at year-end. However, our impairment test is subject to change from period to period as it requires us to make cash flow assumptions about many things including, future margins, volumes, operating costs, capital expenditures, growth rates and discount rates. Our assumptions regarding future margins and volumes require significant judgment as actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to do so. Changes in market conditions could result in impairment charges in the future.  

 Environmental Liabilities  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our total environmental liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities were $108 million and $106 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties. Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. We do not discount our estimated liabilities to present value.  

 Legal Liabilities  In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, and governmental investigations. These matters may involve large or unspecified damages or penalties that may be sought from us and may require years to resolve. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The liability is recorded for an amount that is managements best estimate of the loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss amount of a range of possible outcomes. Significant judgment is required in estimating such liabilities, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results.  

 Income Taxes  As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. We must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. We have recorded a    

 51   
 valuation allowance of $9 million on certain state credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010 based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. We may need to establish an additional valuation allowance if actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods. We also recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that are not recognized that we have taken or expect to take, are recorded as liabilities. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties totaled $33 million and $57 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

 Asset Retirement Obligations  Our asset retirement obligations totaled $30 million and $34 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record asset retirement obligations in the period in which the obligations are incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We use the present value of expected cash flows using third-party estimates or historical data to estimate fair value. The calculation of fair value is based on several estimates and assumptions, including projected cash flows, inflation, a discount rate, the settlement dates or a range of potential settlement dates and the probabilities associated with settlement. We consider our past practice, industry practice, managements intent and estimated economic lives to estimate settlement dates. Our estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the retirement and technological improvements associated with the retirement activities. We cannot currently make reasonable estimates of the fair values of some retirement obligations, principally those associated with our refineries, pipelines and certain terminals and retail stations, because the related assets have indeterminate useful lives which preclude development of assumptions about the potential timing of settlement dates. Such obligations will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status or a liability if the plans are underfunded. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans assets and its projected benefit obligations. While we believe the assumptions we used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.  

 A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the pension plans would have had the following effects in 2010 (in millions):

 Stock-Based Compensation  We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and certain other stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions including the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term, and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The Monte-Carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as outlined above, however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and impact of the possible differing stock price paths. Changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock-based awards. The fair values of our stock appreciation rights, phantom stock options and performance unit awards are estimated at the end of each reporting period and are recorded as liabilities. Changes in our assumptions may impact our liabilities and expenses associated with our stock-based awards.  

 New Accounting Standards and Disclosures  

 Fair Value Measurements  

 We adopted a standard on January 1, 2009, that expanded the framework and disclosures for measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, including:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The adoption of this standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations.  

 In January 2010, the FASB amended the standard covering fair value measurements to require additional disclosures, including transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements, the gross basis presentation of the reconciliation of level 3 fair value measurements, and fair value measurement disclosure at the class level, as opposed to category level, as previously required. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures related to level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (including interim periods). The adoption of the amendment did not impact our financial position or results of operations.  

 Variable Interest Entities  

 The FASB issued a standard in June 2009 that amends previous guidance on variable interest entities. The standard modifies the criteria for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest(s) give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This standard became effective January 1, 2010, and did not impact our financial position or results of operations.
