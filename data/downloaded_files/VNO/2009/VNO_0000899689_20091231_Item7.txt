Overview 

Vornado Realty Trust (Vornado) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 92.5% of the common limited partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2009. All references to we, us, our, the Company and Vornado refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. 

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our core operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexanders, Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments. 

On May 14, 2009, our Board of Trustees executed its long-planned management succession strategy and elected Michael D. Fascitelli, as our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Steven Roth, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board.  

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to that of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) and the SNL REIT Index (SNL) for the following periods ending December 31, 2009 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ______________________ 

 (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future. 

We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there 

 is high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and 

· Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.  

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. 

We may also determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund. We would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the funds performance. The fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the funds investment parameters. If we determine to raise capital through a fund, the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and could not be offered or sold in the United State s absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements.

Overview - continued 

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors. 

The economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the financial and capital markets have negatively affected substantially all businesses, including ours. Demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Real estate transactions and development opportunities have significantly curtailed and capitalization rates have risen. These trends have negatively impacted our 2008 and 2009 financial results, which include losses associated with abandoned development projects, valuation allowances on investments in mezzanine loans and impairments on other real estate investments. The details of these non-cash charges are described below. Impairment losses and valuation allowances are based on our estimates of the amounts we may ultimately realize upon disposition. The estimation pro cess is inherently uncertain and is based upon, among other factors, our expectations of future events, and accordingly, actual amounts received on these investments could differ materially from our estimates. It is not possible for us to quantify the impact of the above trends, which may continue in 2010 and beyond, on our future financial results.

Financings 

 In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters over-allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.  

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039. The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  These notes contain financial covenants, including limitations on outstanding debt and minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. 

During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively. This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired. We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings. In connection with the above, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $25,915,000 from the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income. 

Dispositions 

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washingtons Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000, which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations, on our consolidated statement of income. 

During 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000, which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations, on our consolidated statement of income.  

Mezzanine Loans Receivable 

On June 1, 2009, we were repaid the entire $41,758,000 balance of the Charles Square Hotel loan including accrued interest. This loan was scheduled to mature in September 2009. 

On January 28, 2010, we were repaid the entire $99,314,000 balance of the Equinox loan including accrued interest. This loan, which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500,000, was scheduled to mature in February 2013.

Leasing Activity 

The following table sets forth certain information for the properties we own directly or indirectly, including leasing activity. The leasing activity presented below is based on leases signed during the period and is not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue recognition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Tenant improvements and leasing commissions are presented below based on square feet leased during the period, on a per square foot and per square foot per annum basis based on weighted average lease terms and as a percentage of initial rent per square foot.

(1) Most leases include periodic step-ups in rent, which are not reflected in the initial rent per square foot leased.  

(2) In addition, the New York Office segment leased 43 square feet of retail space during the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average initial rent of $188.09, a 55.7% increase over the prior escalated rent per square foot. 

(3) Under GAAP, acquired below-market leases are marked-to-market at the time of their acquisition. Accordingly, when the space is subsequently re-leased, the cash basis rent increase is greater than the GAAP basis rent increase.

Impact of Retrospective Application of New Accounting Pronouncements 

During 2009, we paid quarterly dividends to our common shareholders in a combination of cash and stock and retrospectively adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding in the computations of income and FFO per share to include the additional common shares resulting from these dividends in the earliest periods presented in each of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and our Current Report on Form 8-K, issued on October 13, 2009, in which we elected to recast our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1) for the year ended December 31, 2008. On December 2, 2009, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF 09-E, Accounting for Distribution to Shareholders with Componen ts of Stock and Cash (EITF 09-E) as codified through Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-1 to ASC 505, Equity. EITF 09-E requires an entity to include the additional common shares resulting from the stock portion of these distributions prospectively in the periods following their issuance in all computations of income per share rather than retrospectively as we had previously done. As a result, we have adjusted all of our computations of income and FFO per share presented herein to exclude the additional shares resulting from these dividends in periods prior to their issuance. Below is a reconciliation of previously reported income and FFO per share to the amounts presented herein.

Overview - continued 

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which was required to be applied retrospectively. The adoption affected the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures by requiring the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a debt component and an equity component in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the date of issue. The initial debt components of our $1.4 billion Convertible Senior Debentures, $1 billion Convertible Senior Debentures and $500 million Exchangeable Senior Debentures were $1,241,286,000, $926,361,000 and $457,699,000, respectively, based on the fair value of similar nonconvertible instruments issued at that time. The aggregate initial debt discount of $216,655,000 after original issuance costs allocated to the equity component was recorded in additional capital in our consolidated statement of changes in equity. The discount is amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding (i.e., the earliest date the holders may require us to repurchase the debentures), which resulted in $39,546,000 and $30,418,000 of additional interest expense in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810, Consolidation, which requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. It also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parents ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009 and resulted in (i) the reclassification of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiarie s, a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets, (ii) the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, on our consolidated statements of income, and (iii) additional disclosures, including a consolidated statement of changes in equity in quarterly reporting periods. 

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to ASC 805, Business Combinations, which applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. It also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition. The amended guidance also expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The amended guidance b ecame effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements because there have been no acquisitions during 2009. 

In March 2008, the FASB issued an update to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. It also provided a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuers own stock. The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance on Januar y 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2008, the FASB issued an update to ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, which requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as participating securities and include such securities in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in ASC 260. The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009 and required all prior period earnings per share data presented, to be adjusted retroactively. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share. 

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance for other than temporary impairments (OTTI) of investments in debt securities, which changes the presentation of OTTI in financial statements. Under this guidance, if an OTTI debt security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount, the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings. Otherwise, losses on debt securities must be separated into two categories, the portion which is considered credit loss, which is charged to earnings, and the portion due to other factors, which is charged to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of balance sheet equity. When an unrealized loss on a fixed maturity security is not considered OTTI, the unrealized loss continues to be charged to other comprehensive income (loss) and not to earn ings. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810, Consolidation, which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary, based on whether the entity has (i) power over the significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  

71  

Critical Accounting Policies  

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Real Estate 

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.455 billion and $15.652 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. 

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions.  

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the propertys carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.  

Identified Intangibles  

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases), a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, were $442,510,000 and $522,719,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets, were $633,492,000 and $719,822,000, respectively. Identified intangibles are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, separate and apart from goodwill. Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including related real estate, if appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. If intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material. 

72  

Critical Accounting Policies  continued 

Mezzanine Loans Receivable 

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities that have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable, net were $203,286,000 and $472,539,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans each quarter, if circumstances warrant, in determining whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  

Partially Owned Entities 

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders and Toys R Us, were $1.209 billion and $1.083 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, or receive a majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.  

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment each quarter, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. &nbsp ; The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts 

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($46,708,000 and $32,834,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($4,680,000 and $5,773,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  

73  

Critical Accounting Policies  continued 

Revenue Recognition 

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: 

· Base Rent  income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straigh t-line basis over the term of the lease.  

· Percentage Rent  income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon sales of the tenants exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved). 

· Hotel Revenue  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. 

· Trade Shows Revenue  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred. 

· Expense Reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. 

· Management, Leasing and Other Fees  income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.  

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.  

Income Taxes 

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Notes to the preceding tabular information: 

(1) EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows and may not be c omparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 

(2) Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities. 

(3) Other EBITDA is comprised of:

Revenues 

Our revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements, hotel revenues, trade shows revenues, amortization of acquired below-market leases, net of above-market leases, and fee and other income, were $2,742,578,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $2,692,686,000 in the prior year, an increase of $49,892,000. Below are the details of the increase (decrease) by segment: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

____________________________ 

(1) Primarily due to a lease modification that reduced the term of a portion of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Companys (AXA) space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, which resulted in additional amortization of approximately $12,000 in the prior year. 

(2) Primarily due to lower REVPAR. 

(3) Primarily due to lower exhibitor occupancy. 

(4) Results from the elimination of inter-company fees from operating segments upon consolidation. See note (3) on page 80. 

(5) In December 2009, our agreement to sell an 8.6 acre parcel of land in the Pentagon City area of Arlington, Virginia, was terminated by the buyer. Accordingly, we recognized $27,089 of income, representing the buyers forfeited non-refundable purchase deposit. In connection therewith, we wrote down the carrying amount of the land to its fair value and recognized a $24,875 impairment loss which is included as a component of impairment and other losses on our consolidated statement of income. 

(6) Includes $5,402 of income previously deferred resulting from the termination of a lease with a partially owned entity.

Expenses 

Our expenses, which consist of operating, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses and costs of acquisitions and developments not consummated were $1,946,799,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $1,881,735,000 in the prior year, an increase of $65,064,000. Below are the details of the increase (decrease) by segment: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

_________________________ 

(1) Results from a $7,025 increase in BMS operating expenses and a $6,333 increase in property level operating expenses, primarily due to higher real estate taxes. 

(2) Primarily due to a $8,190 decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes which are reimbursed by tenants.  

(3) Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter-company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation. 

(4) Primarily due to a lease modification that reduced the term of a portion of AXAs space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, which resulted in additional depreciation of approximately $16,000 in the prior year. 

(5) On March 31, 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their 2007 and 2008 stock option awards and their 2008 out-performance plan awards. Accordingly, we recognized $32,588 of expense in the first quarter of 2009, representing the unamortized portion of these awards. 

(6) This increase in expense is entirely offset by a corresponding increase in income from the mark-to-market of the deferred compensation plan assets, a component of interest and other investment income on our consolidated statement of income.  

(7) Primarily due to 2009 pension plan termination costs of $2,800. 

(8) Primarily due to lower payroll and stock-based compensation expense.

Our 32.4% share of Alexanders net income (comprised of our share of Alexanders net income, management, leasing and development fees) was $53,529,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $36,671,000 for the prior year, an increase of $16,858,000. The increase was primarily due to $13,668,000 of income for our share of an income tax benefit and $11,105,000 for our share of the reversal of a portion of previously recognized stock appreciation rights compensation expense in the current year, compared to $6,583,000 for our share of such income in the prior year.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest and Debt Expense 

Interest and debt expense was $634,283,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $635,724,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $1,441,000. This decrease resulted primarily from savings of (i) $17,561,000 from a decrease in outstanding debt of approximately $1.5 billion, the full year effect of which is approximately $100,000,000, (ii) $27,830,000 from lower average interest rates on variable rate debt (1.61% in 2009 as compared to 3.88% in 2008), (iii) $1,857,000 from other items, partially offset by (iv) a decrease in capitalized interest of $45,807,000.  

Net (Loss) Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt 

Net loss on early extinguishment of debt was $25,915,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting primarily from the acquisition and retirement of approximately $1.9 billion of our convertible senior debentures and related write-off of the unamortized debt discount. Net gain on early extinguishment of debt was $9,820,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting primarily from the acquisition and retirement of approximately $81,540,000 of senior unsecured notes and $27,500,000 of convertible senior debentures. 

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate 

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $5,641,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $7,757,000 in the prior year and was primarily comprised of net gains on sale of marketable securities and residential condominiums.

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $20,737,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to an income tax benefit of $204,537,000 in the prior year. The prior year income tax benefit was the result of a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with our acquisition of H Street. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008 and reversed the deferred tax liabilities.  

Discontinued Operations 

The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 include the operating results of 1999 K Street, which was sold on September 1, 2009; Americold, which was sold on March 31, 2008 and Tysons Dulles Plaza, which was sold on June 10, 2008.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, Including Unit Distributions 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of (i) allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $5,834,000 and $33,327,000, respectively, (ii) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $2,839,000 and $3,263,000, respectively and (iii) preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership of $19,286,000 and $22,084,000, respectively. The decrease of $27,493,000 in allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests resulted primarily from lower net income subject to allocation to the unitholders. The decrease of $2,798,000 in preferred unit distributions was primarily due to a write-off of unit issuance costs in the prior year.  

Preferred Share Dividends 

Preferred share dividends were $57,076,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $57,091,000 for the prior year.

Same Store EBITDA 

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses that are not considered property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items. We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative t o net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(3) Primarily due to higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower real estate taxes. 

(4) Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter-company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation. 

(5) Primarily due to a $15,344 reduction from the mark-to-market of investments in our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding reduction in interest and other investment (loss) income, net), partially offset by a $4,600 pension termination cost, higher compensation expense and professional fees.

Interest and debt expense was $635,724,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $599,804,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $35,920,000. This increase was primarily due to the full year effect of interest expense from properties acquired during 2007 and property level refinancings during 2008, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average interest rates on variable rate debt.  

Net Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt 

In the year ended December 31, 2008, we had a $9,820,000 net gain from the early extinguishment of debt which resulted primarily from purchases of certain of our convertible senior debentures. 

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

The decrease results primarily from a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with the acquisition of H Street. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.

Supplemental Information  continued  

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

On March 2, 2009, Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli each exercised 150,000 stock appreciation rights (SARs) which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and each received gross proceeds of $11,419,000. 

On September 9, 2008, Alexanders Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008. The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexanders. Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexanders.  

On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Mr. Roth exercised an aggregate of 200,000 SARs which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.  

Interstate Properties (Interstate) 

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders, are Interstates two other partners. As of December 31, 2009, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 7.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexanders common stock. 

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $782,000, $803,000 and $800,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.  

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt or equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

We may determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund. We would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the funds performance. The fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the funds investment parameters. If we determine to raise capital through a fund, the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and could not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements. 

Acquisitions and Investments 

We did not make any significant investments in real estate during 2009. 

Financings 

 In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters over-allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.  

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039. The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. 

During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively. This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired. We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings. In connection with the above, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $25,915,000 from the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income  

We continue to evaluate plans to renovate and reposition the Springfield mall; given current economic conditions, that may require us to renegotiate the terms of the existing debt and, accordingly, we have requested that the debt be placed with the special servicer. 

Dispositions 

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building in Washingtons Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000, which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income. 

During 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000, which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income.

Mezzanine Loans 

On June 1, 2009, we were repaid the entire $41,758,000 balance of the Charles Square Hotel loan including accrued interest. This loan was scheduled to mature in September 2009. 

On January 28, 2010, we were repaid the entire $99,314,000 balance of the Equinox loan including accrued interest. This loan, which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500,000, was scheduled to mature in February 2013.   

Certain Future Cash Requirements 

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures  

We are currently engaged in various development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $200,000,000. Of this amount, $78,118,000 was expended prior to 2009 and $50,513,000 was expended during 2009. Substantially all of the estimated costs to complete our development projects aggregating approximately $71,000,000 are anticipated to be expended during 2010, of which approximately $18,000,000 is expected to be funded by existing construction loans. 

Other Capital Expenditures 

The following table summarizes other anticipated 2010 capital expenditures. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

____________________________ 

(1) Primarily 555 California Street, Hotel Pennsylvania and Warehouses.  

(2) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2010 leasing activity are $70.50 ($4.50 per annum) and $13.50 ($2.50 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively.  

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of non-consolidated entities, including Alexanders, Toys and Lexington, as these entities fund their capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.  

Dividends 

On January 13, 2010, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.65 per common share, payable all in cash on February 22, 2010. This dividend policy, if continued for all of 2010, would require approximately $507,000,000 of cash in the aggregate for common share dividends. In addition, we expect to pay cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares during 2010 aggregating approximately $57,000,000.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations 

We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes and that as of December 31, 2009 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a well-known seasoned issuer.  

Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009.

Insurance 

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate. 

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (PPIC), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) acts, as defined by TRIPRA. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC. 

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.  

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $135,000,000. 

At December 31, 2009, $37,232,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under our $0.965 billion revolving credit facility. Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $90,406,000. Of this amount, $71,788,000 is committed to the India Property Fund and is pledged as collateral to its lender.

Litigation 

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC-NJ) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the mo tions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Courts decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Courts decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Courts decision which was denied on March 13, 2007. Discovery is now complete. On October 19, 2009, Stop & Shop filed a motion for leave to amend its pleadings to assert new claims for relief, including a claim for damages in an unspecified amount, and an additional affirmative defense. The motion was argued and submitted for decision on December 18, 2009. The course of future proceedings will depend upon the outcome of Stop & Shops motion, but we anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2010. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above relating to a dispute over the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships. In decisions iss ued in 2006, 2007 and 2009, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed all of Mr. Trumps claims, and those decisions were affirmed by the Appellate Division. Mr. Trump cannot further appeal those decisions.  

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (H Street) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants. In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee. In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners. The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages. We believe this claim is without merit and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, this c laim will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs. Our cash and cash equivalents were $535,479,000 at December 31, 2009, a $991,374,000 decrease over the balance at December 31, 2008.

Funds From Operations (FFO) 

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets and GAAP extraordinary items, and to include depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate dimin ishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 15  Income per Share, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements on page 153 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $583,596,000, or $3.36 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $813,064,000 or $4.97 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $20,000 or $0.00 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to negative FFO of $88,154,000, or $0.57 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2008. Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial results summary of our Overview.
