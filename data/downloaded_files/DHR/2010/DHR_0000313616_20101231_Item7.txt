ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of Danahers financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Companys MD&A is divided into four main sections:  

       Overview  

       Results of Operations  

       Liquidity and Capital Resources  

       Critical Accounting Estimates  

OVERVIEW  

General  

Please see Item 1. Business  General for a discussion of Danahers objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2010, approximately 55% of Danahers sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. For example, in those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Companys customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Companys individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.  

As a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of challenges and opportunities, including rapid technological development in most of our served markets, the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of our competitors. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business (including through geographical and product line expansion), identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil) in order to improve the efficiency of our operations and be responsive to our customers throughout the world.  

Business Performance and Outlook  

While differences exist among the Companys businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Companys products and services increased substantially in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth. The growth in sales is due in part to the stabilization in global economic conditions that began in the fourth quarter 2009, easier year-over-year comparisons resulting from the recessionary economic conditions that prevailed during most of 2009, investments made in sales growth initiatives and other business-specific factors discussed below. Year-over-year sales growth rates during 2010 were led by emerging markets, with particular strength in China. North America and Europe also grew on a year-over-year basis, but at a lesser rate than the emerging markets. Providing no significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs, the Company expects sales to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2011 but at a moderating rate from that experienced during 2010 due primarily to more difficult year-over-year comparisons.

Acquisitions; Joint Venture with Cooper Industries plc  

On January 30, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS Inc., which includes a 50% ownership position in the Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (AB Sciex) and a 100% ownership position in the Molecular Devices business (Molecular Devices). In a separate but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB Sciex from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was $1.1 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. The aggregate sales of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices in their last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately $650 million and these businesses now operate within the Companys Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. The acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices significantly expand the Companys position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular establish a position in the mass spectrometry market. AB Sciex is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities in the Companys Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment, both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. Company management and other personnel are devoting significant resources to the successful integration of the acquired businesses into Danaher.  

In addition to the acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, the Company acquired 17 businesses during 2010 for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.1 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Test & Measurement, Dental, Environmental and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these 17 acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $440 million.  

On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (Cooper), combining certain of the Companys hand tool manufacturing and distribution businesses with Coopers Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC (Apex). The 2009 sales, on a combined basis, of the two tools businesses contributed to Apex were approximately $1.2 billion. Each of Cooper and the Company owns a 50% interest in Apex and has an equal number of representatives on Apexs Board of Directors. Upon the closing of the transaction, Apex simultaneously obtained a credit facility and term debt financing and used $45 million of the term debt financing to purchase from the Company certain assets of the Companys hand tools business. In addition to the cash received for the purchase of these assets, the Company recorded a receivable from Apex of $45 million upon closing. Subsequent to the formation of the joint venture, the Company collected $11.3 million from Apex related to the receivable and expects to the collect the balance in 2011. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated the financial results of its contributed businesses and began accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. In accordance with accounting standards applicable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, the Company recognized a $291 million gain ($232.2 million or $0.34 per diluted share on an after-tax basis) during the third quarter 2010 associated with the transaction reflecting the difference between the book value of the contributed business that was deconsolidated and the fair value of the consideration received in exchange, including the 50% interest in Apex and the cash and receivables received from Apex in connection with the transaction.  

Recent Acquisition and Divestiture Developments  

In January 2011, the Company announced that it has agreed to sell its Pacific Scientific Aerospace business for a sale price of $685 million in cash. This business, which is part of the Industrial Technologies segment and supplies safety, security and electric power components to commercial and military aerospace markets globally, had annual revenues of $378 million in 2010. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to the business, and is expected to close in the first half of 2011. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company expects to report an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $200 million or $0.29 per diluted share. The Company committed to sell the business subsequent to the end of 2010 and will be reporting the business as a discontinued operation in future filings.  

Also in January 2011, the Company announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market, for a purchase price of approximately 350 million ($470 million based on exchange rates on the date of the agreement), net of cash acquired. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals  

32  

Table of Contents 

 and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to EskoArtwork, and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2011. EskoArtworks suite of software and hardware solutions helps its customers reduce digital design cycle time and ensure integrity throughout the packaging material supply chain. EskoArtwork had revenues of $247 million (based on exchange rates at December 31, 2010) in its most recent completed fiscal year and is expected to become part of the Companys product identification platform included in the Industrial Technologies segment.  

On February 6, 2011, the Company and Beckman Coulter, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which the Company is making a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter for $83.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.8 billion including debt assumed and net of cash acquired, to be followed by a second step cash-out merger at the offer price. The offer is subject to customary conditions, including tender of a majority of the outstanding shares (on a fully diluted basis) into the offer, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to Beckman Coulter. The Company anticipates completing the offer in the first half of 2011. Beckman Coulter develops, manufactures and markets products that simplify, automate and innovate complex biomedical testing. Its diagnostic systems are found in hospitals and other clinical settings around the world and produce information used by physicians to diagnose disease, make treatment decisions and monitor patients. Scientists use its life science research instruments to study complex biological problems including causes of disease and potential new therapies or drugs. Beckman Coulter had revenues of approximately $3.7 billion in 2010, and would become part of the Companys Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. 

The Company anticipates financing the acquisition of Beckman Coulter through a combination of available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and proceeds from the issuance of securities. The Company may also enter into one or more additional credit facilities in order to expand borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and issue commercial paper in amounts in excess of the programs current capacity, and may also enter into one or more bridge loan agreements to provide temporary financing pending the implementation of more permanent financing arrangements.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 18.0% compared to 2009. Sales from existing businesses increased 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 0.5% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, slightly stronger against other major currencies during 2010 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2009. Acquired businesses provided sales growth of approximately 7.0%. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales calculated according to GAAP but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses, (2) second half 2009 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture, and (3) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. The portion of sales attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales from acquired businesses and second half 2009 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding the same items) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of the second half 2009 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture because as a result of application of the equity method of accounting beginning with the formation of the joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Company did not recognize sales from those businesses in the second half of 2010.  

Operating profit margins were 16.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons also benefited from approximately 160 basis points of incremental restructuring costs  

33

 incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. The favorable settlement of litigation with Align Technologies in the third quarter 2009 adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses, 2009 divestitures and the operating profit margin impact of contributing certain businesses to the Apex joint venture adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by approximately 65 basis points. Acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the Company (net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in the comparable period of 2009) also adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009.  

Operating profit margins were 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins during 2009 is primarily a result of lower sales volumes in 2009 compared to 2008, as well as restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the level incurred during 2008 which reduced operating profit margin comparisons by 115 basis points on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 20 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. In addition, accounting charges recorded in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points as such charges were greater in 2008 than 2009.  

Business Segments  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company changed the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in its internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Companys businesses and the contribution of certain of the Companys hand tool manufacturing and distribution businesses to the Apex joint venture. The Company now reports results in five separate business segments consisting of the Test & Measurement; Environmental; Life Sciences & Diagnostics; Dental; and Industrial Technologies segments. In addition, the historical results of the hand tool businesses contributed to Apex and the Companys equity in earnings of the Apex joint venture will be shown separately in the Companys segment disclosures. The Company previously reported its operations under four segments: Professional Instrumentation; Medical Technologies; Industrial Technologies; and Tools & Components.  

The table below summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated ($ in millions):

2010 COMPARED TO 2009  

During 2010, demand increased significantly for the business core instruments, including oscilloscopes, thermography products and digital multi-meters. Sales were strong in all major geographies, with particular strength in China. In addition, distributor inventory reductions that occurred in the first three quarters of 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions did not continue into 2010 which positively impacted the year-over-year comparisons. Sales from existing businesses in the segments network and communication businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 on a year-over-year basis driven by strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions. Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010.  

Operating profit margins increased 660 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 265 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. Acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points as such charges were greater in 2009 than in 2010. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 130 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons, partially offsetting these favorable year-over-year factors.  

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

Soft demand across all instrumentation related product lines, attributable to general economic conditions and inventory reductions by distributors, drove sales declines from existing businesses during 2009. Year-over-year price increases of 1.5% partially offset the sales decline during 2009. While year-over-year sales declined during each quarter during 2009, the rate of decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year primarily due to the adverse impact of inventory level reductions in the distribution channel that were largely completed by the end of the third quarter. Year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter were also  

35  

Table of Contents 

 favorably impacted by the decline in demand that commenced in the fourth quarter 2008 resulting in an easier comparison. Sales declined in all significant geographic regions. Year-over-year sales in the network and communication businesses declined at a lower rate than the instrumentation business primarily as a result of positive performance in the network management solutions businesses which benefited from the competition among mobile telecommunication providers to expand coverage, services and performance of their networks.  

Operating profit margins decreased 390 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 230 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a year-over-year basis by 35 basis points. Accounting charges incurred in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 120 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses also partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins.  

ENVIRONMENTAL  

The Companys Environmental segment provides products that help protect our water supply and air quality and serves two primary markets: water quality and retail/commercial petroleum. Danahers water quality business is a global leader in water quality analysis and treatment, providing instrumentation and disinfection systems to help analyze and manage the quality of ultra pure, potable, and waste water in residential, commercial and industrial applications. Danahers retail/commercial petroleum business is a leading worldwide provider of products and services for the retail/commercial petroleum market.

2010 COMPARED TO 2009  

Sales grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 in both the water quality and retail petroleum equipment businesses. Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

36  

Table of Contents 

Sales from existing businesses in the segments water quality businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009. Demand for the businesses laboratory and process instrumentation product lines was led by industrial markets and was stronger in all major geographies as compared to 2009. Sales in the business ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a high-single digit rate during 2010. Solid year-over-year growth in the product lines industrial and residential applications was partially offset by a difficult prior year comparison associated with a significant drinking water treatment project that favorably impacted revenues throughout 2009 and into the first half of 2010. Despite the difficult year-over-year comparison, underlying demand in the product lines municipal markets remains robust. Sales in the business chemical treatment solutions product line also grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 due, in part, to continuing expansion of the chemical treatment solutions product line outside of the US market.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments retail petroleum equipment businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009. Strong North American demand during 2010 for the business payment and point-of-sale retail solutions products was driven by enhanced industry standards deadlines and contributed significantly to the year-over-year sales growth. Demand for dispensing equipment also increased in all major geographic regions due to an increase in capital spending by customers. The business growth rate is expected to moderate in 2011 compared to 2010 as North American demand for payment and point-of-sale products is expected to moderate following the 2010 deadlines referenced above. Sales declines in the business vapor recovery product offerings in North America, primarily due to regulatory compliance deadlines in 2009 compared to 2010, partially offset these increases.  

Operating profit margins increased 110 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 100 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 55 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons, partially offsetting these favorable year-over-year factors. Incremental year-over-year investments in 2010 associated with the segments emerging market growth initiatives also negatively impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.  

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

Sales in the water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis while sales in the retail petroleum equipment businesses declined as compared to 2008. Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. A mid-teens growth rate in the business ultraviolet water treatment product line and a mid-single digit growth rate in the chemical treatment solutions product line along with year-over-year price increases of 2.0% offset low-single digit sales declines in the business laboratory and process instrumentation product line. Growth rates in the ultraviolet water treatment product line reflected strength in demand for municipal wastewater applications, as well as shipments related to a significant drinking water treatment plant project that commenced in 2009. In the business laboratory and process instrumentation and consumable product line, general economic conditions adversely impacted demand in all major geographies with the exception of China, where revenues grew at a low double-digit rate during 2009.  

Sales from existing businesses in the retail petroleum equipment business during 2009 declined at a low-single digit rate as compared to 2008. Strong North American sales of the business point-of-sale retail and payment solution product offerings that were driven in part by regulatory requirements were more than offset by lower demand for dispensing equipment, primarily in Europe, and service offerings. Lower demand for the business automatic tank gauge product offerings and leak detection systems also adversely impacted year-over-year comparisons. The decline in demand for the business leak detection systems was partially attributable to a significant project in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009.  

Operating profit margins decreased 30 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes from existing businesses during 2009, as well as 45 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The dilutive effect of recently acquired  

37

 businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a year-over-year basis by 50 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins.  

LIFE SCIENCES & DIAGNOSTICS  

The Companys life sciences businesses offer a broad range of research and clinical tools that are used by scientists to study cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of complex biological matters. The Companys diagnostics businesses offer a broad range of analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that are used to diagnose disease, make treatment decisions and monitor patients in hospitals and other critical care settings.

2010 COMPARED TO 2009  

During 2010, sales from existing businesses grew in each of the segments businesses. Sales growth from acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of AB/Sciex and Molecular Devices in January 2010. Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments acute care diagnostics business grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to strong demand in all major geographies for a new version of the business compact blood gas analyzer. Increased European demand for the business cardiac care instruments as well as continued strong consumable sales related to the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation also contributed to year-over-year sales growth.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010 as compared 2009. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by strong demand in all major geographies for new instruments and consumables in the pathology diagnostics business. Increased sales of compound and stereo microscopy equipment serving the life sciences research and industrial markets also contributed to the growth. Japanese economic stimulus funding also positively impacted 2010 sales as purchases were required to be completed by March 2010 in order to be eligible for Japanese stimulus funding.

Operating profit margins decreased 220 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. Acquisition related charges during 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances, primarily related to the AB Sciex and Molecular Devices acquisitions, as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the Company (in each case net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in the comparable period of 2009) adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 265 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. The favorable impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009, cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities and 50 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts.  

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

During 2009, sales growth in the segments acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostic businesses was largely offset by sales declines in the segments life sciences instrumentation businesses. Price increases contributed 1.5% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

Sales from existing businesses in the acute care diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Continued strong aftermarket consumables sales related to the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation drove the majority of the growth during 2009. Increased sales of the business cardiac marking instrument also contributed to the year-over-year growth. Sales grew at a double-digit rate in China and the emerging economies of Latin America during 2009, while combined Europe and North America sales were flat.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments life science instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses declined at a low-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales growth attributable to pathology diagnostic instrumentation and associated consumable products, primarily outside of North America, was more than offset by sales declines attributable to lower demand for compound and stereo microscopy equipment primarily in Europe and North America. Lower demand for microscopy equipment resulted largely from lower capital spending in the Companys customer base throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the life sciences instrumentation business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year as economic stimulus funding, primarily in Japan, began to favorably impact the business.  

Operating profit margins declined 90 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. Restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 65 basis points on a year-over-year basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 5 basis points. The impact of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 100 basis points. While the year-over-year sales declines diminished leverage of the segments fixed cost base, the 2009 cost savings attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses offset this adverse impact.  

DENTAL  

The Companys Dental segment is a leading worldwide provider of a broad range of equipment and consumables for the dental market, focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative solutions for dental professionals around the world.

Price increases throughout the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments dental technologies businesses grew at a low double-digit rate and increased in all major product categories during 2010 as compared to 2009. Growth was led by increased sales in the imaging product lines as a result of strong demand for 3D equipment and a recently introduced digital x-ray sensor. Year-over-year demand also increased for the business instruments and treatment units. Imaging product sales were particularly strong in North America and Asia, while instrument and treatment unit sales were particularly strong in Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses were essentially flat in 2010 as compared to 2009. Robust demand for orthodontia products throughout 2010 in addition to increased sales of infection control products were offset by weak demand for general dentistry consumables (primarily during the first three quarters of 2010) primarily as a result of adjustments to inventory levels in distribution channels that occurred during those periods. Demand in the general dentistry consumable businesses increased sequentially in the fourth quarter 2010 as inventories in the distribution channels returned to more normalized levels.  

Operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in operating profit margins is largely due to the favorable settlement of litigation with Align Technologies that occurred in 2009 and adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 10 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. The favorable impact of higher sales volumes during 2010 compared to 2009, cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities and 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts.  

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

Price increases contributed 1.0% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.

Table of Contents 

Sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables business in 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. Increased sales of orthodontia and infection control products during 2009 were offset by weaker demand for implants, endodontic products and general dentistry consumables. Lower capital spending by customers and inventory reductions in certain distribution channels drove year-over-year sales declines at a mid-teen rate in the dental technologies businesses. While year-over-year sales in the dental technologies business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year due to strong sales of treatment units in Europe, as well as easier year-over-year comparisons due to a large stocking order for imaging equipment that occurred in the third quarter 2008.  

Operating profit margins increased 310 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points. Restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 140 basis points on a year-over-year basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points. The impact of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 20 basis points. While the year-over-year sales declines diminished leverage of the segments fixed cost base, the 2009 cost savings attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset this adverse impact.  

INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES  

The Companys Industrial Technologies segment manufactures products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines, as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment consists of two strategic lines of business, product identification and motion, as well as the sensors and controls, aerospace and defense and engine retarder businesses.

2010 COMPARED TO 2009  

Price increases throughout the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments product identification businesses grew at a mid-teens rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased demand for core marking and coding equipment as customers released capital spending that had been delayed from prior years. Strong consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to year-over-year growth. Sales grew in all major geographies with particular strength in Europe and the emerging markets.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments motion businesses grew at a double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 as demand was strong in the majority of end markets served due primarily to the general economic recovery. While growth was generally broad-based, industrial automation led the growth with strong sales of advanced motor and drive product offerings. Sales increased in all major geographies.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments other businesses grew collectively at a high-single digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to generally higher demand in most major end-markets. Demand increased in the segments sensors and controls businesses and engine-retarder business during 2010. Sales in the aerospace and defense businesses were essentially flat compared to 2009 as the aerospace end markets did not begin to recover from the recession until the second half of 2010.  

Operating profit margins increased 540 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 175 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. The divestiture of certain lower margin businesses and product lines in the fourth quarter 2009 in connection with the Companys restructuring activities also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 40 basis points.  

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

Sales declines in a majority of the segments businesses during 2009 more than offset sales growth of approximately 1.5% related to price increases which are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments product identification businesses declined at a high single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales declines during 2009 resulted primarily from weak demand for core marking and coding equipment due to lower capital spending by customers as a result of general economic conditions. Sales of consumable products associated with the businesses installed base of marking and coding equipment also declined on a year-over-year basis but not as significantly as equipment sales. During the fourth quarter of 2009, equipment sales increased on a year-over-year basis primarily due to emerging market growth. Flat consumable product sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 were an improvement compared to year-over-year consumable sales declines during the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the China market grew during the second half of 2009, resulting in low-single digit sales growth for the full year.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments motion businesses declined at double digit rates during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales declined as a result of weak demand for most of the businesses product offerings attributable to the recessionary economic conditions that existed throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the motion businesses declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved slightly compared to the second and third quarters of the year, due to improvements in demand for certain product offerings and the absence of inventory reductions experienced in early 2009 in the business distribution channels.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments other businesses declined at a low-double digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Companys sensors and controls business saw modest improvement in certain end markets during the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to the first nine months of 2009. Demand in the Companys aerospace and defense businesses softened in the second half of 2009, however, primarily due to declines in demand in the commercial aviation end markets. Continued capital project freezes by the United States Postal Service contributed to year-over-year sales declines in the business integrated scanning system product line.

Table of Contents 

Operating profit margins in the segment declined 160 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 75 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The impact of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, combined with the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 10 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset these negative factors.  

GROSS PROFIT  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross profit margins for 2010 increased 300 basis points from 2009. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of higher sales volumes as compared to 2009, year-over-year cost savings attributable to the Companys 2009 restructuring activities and 95 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. Gross profit margins during 2010 also benefited from the contribution to the Apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter of certain of the Companys hand tools businesses that had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the Company. Acquisition related charges recorded in 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of AB Sciex, Molecular Devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 30 basis points.  

Gross profit margins for 2009 increased 40 basis points from 2008. Cost savings related to 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities primarily drove the year-over-year improvements in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009. Lower year-over-year commodity costs also contributed to the improvement, as costs for several types of raw materials increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009. Lower overall sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 diminished the leverage of the Companys fixed cost base and partially offset these positive factors. In addition, costs incurred associated with year-over-year incremental 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted gross profit margins by 65 basis points.  

OPERATING EXPENSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The year-over-year decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 reflects the benefit of increased leverage of the Companys cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2010 as compared to 2009 in addition to 65 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared

Table of Contents 

to 2010. Incremental year-over-year investments in the Companys sales growth initiatives, increased commission costs due to the higher sales volumes and the dilutive effect of certain recently acquired businesses and those businesses higher relative operating expense structures partially offset these year-over-year improvements.  

The year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to reduced leverage of the Companys cost base caused by lower sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008. Incremental year-over-year costs associated with 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis, although the 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions generated year-over-year cost savings that partially offset these negative factors.  

Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points during 2010 on a year-over-year basis. The increase is primarily attributable to the contribution of the Companys hand tools businesses to the Apex joint venture, as the research and development spending of such businesses has historically been less than the Company average. Overall research and development costs also increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to recently acquired businesses, primarily AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the Companys new product development initiatives.  

Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were flat during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Company continued to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses.  

EARNINGS FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE  

As previously discussed, in July, 2010 the Company closed on the formation of the Apex joint venture. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated its contributed businesses and commenced accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. As a result of the Companys continuing involvement with the joint venture, the contributed businesses are not presented as a discontinued operation. The equity in the earnings of Apex, reflecting the Companys 50% ownership position subsequent to the formation, is reflected in the Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  

The impact on the Companys results of operations from (1) the contributed business prior to the formation of Apex, and (2) the Companys equity in the earnings of Apex subsequent to the formation of Apex, is reflected in the table below ($ in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME  

For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financing Activities and Indebtedness below.  

Interest expense of $121 million in 2010 was essentially flat as compared to 2009. Interest expense of $123 million in 2009 was $7.5 million lower than 2008 primarily as a result of lower average debt levels during 2009 as the Company deployed cash flows to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings. Interest attributable to the $750 million principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes issued in March 2009 partially offset the positive impact of the reduction in outstanding commercial paper borrowings.  

44  

Table of Contents 

The Company recognized interest income of $6 million, $5 million and $10 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income in 2010 was higher than interest income in 2009 due to higher average invested cash balances. Interest income in 2009 was lower than interest income in 2008 as the lower interest rates on deposits in 2009 compared to 2008 more than offset higher average invested cash balances.  

INCOME TAXES  

General  

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Companys financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.  

The Companys effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The Companys effective tax rate for 2010 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.5 billion.  

The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitation, reserves are adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate  

The Companys effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 23.5%, 19.2% and 24.7%, respectively.  

The Companys 2010 effective tax rate of 23.5% reflects the benefit of earnings outside the United States taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Federal income tax rate. The 2010 effective tax rate includes the benefit of approximately 50 basis points ($11.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share) of discrete tax reserve reductions associated with resolution of certain international and domestic tax positions and refinements of reserve estimates related to prior period tax contingencies. The Companys tax provision was reduced by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of the extension of the research and experimentation credit and other U.S. legislation enacted in December 2010 related to taxation of international earnings.  

The Companys 2009 effective tax rate of 19.2% includes the impact of approximately 680 basis points ($97.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share) related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with the resolution of uncertain tax positions and discrete items. The impact of expensing transaction costs (in accordance with the business combination accounting standard that became effective at the beginning of 2009), much of which are not deductible for income tax purposes, partially offset these beneficial factors.  

The effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be approximately 25.5%. The anticipated increase from the 2010 rate is largely attributable to recent U.S. legislation effective as of the beginning of 2011 that repealed or modified certain tax provisions applicable to U.S. companies having international operations that enable the use of foreign tax credits to offset U.S. corporate income taxes.

INFLATION  

The effect of broad based inflation on the Companys operations was not significant in the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.  

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.  

Interest Rate Risk  

A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2010, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock) by approximately $105 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the Companys results of operations or stockholders equity.  

As of December 31, 2010, the Companys variable-rate debt obligations relate primarily to U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings, and as a result its primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2010. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2010, a 100% increase in average market interest rates on the Companys commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Companys interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 100% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Companys actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2010.  

Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

The Company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The Eurobond Notes described below (which as of December 31, 2010 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to $669 million) provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Companys net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Companys Eurobond Notes, is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2010 (net of the translation effect of the Companys Eurobond Notes) would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately $450 million.  

The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred, and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. 

46  

Table of Contents 

Currency exchange rates decreased reported 2010 sales by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, slightly stronger against other major currencies during 2010 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2009. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began in the second quarter 2010 and prevailed throughout most of the remainder of 2010 more than offset the U.S. dollars weakness against other major currencies during the first quarter of 2010.  

If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2010 prevail throughout 2011, currency exchange rates will positively impact 2011 reported sales by approximately 1.0% relative to the Companys performance in 2010. Weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a further positive impact on the Companys reported sales and results of operations. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Companys sales and results of operations on an overall basis.  

The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements.  

Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.  

In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Companys customers. The Companys businesses perform ongoing credit evaluations of their customers financial conditions and typically obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.  

Equity Price Risk  

The Companys available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Companys available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2010 would have reduced the fair value of the Companys available-for-sale investment portfolio by approximately $26 million.  

Commodity Price Risk

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Management assesses the Companys liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. For a discussion of risks related to the uncertainty in the financial markets and the global economy in general, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity, increased $284 million, or approximately 16%, during 2010 as compared to 2009.  

       Funding for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2010. The Company acquired 19 businesses during 2010. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $2.1 billion in cash, net of cash acquired.  

       The Company repaid approximately $9 million of debt (net of new borrowings) during 2010.  

       The Companys restructuring activities used approximately $110 million in cash during 2010.  

       The Company contributed approximately $90 million in cash to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $33 million to the Companys non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2010.  

       As of December 31, 2010, the Company held $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents.

Operating Activities  

The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.  

Operating cash flow was approximately $2.1 billion for 2010, an increase of $284 million, or 16% as compared to 2009. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009. Partially offsetting this benefit was an investment in trade accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable which in the aggregate used $204 million of cash flow during 2010 as compared to contributing $228 million of cash flow during 2009. The increased use of cash reflects increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, partially offset by increased accounts payable levels, associated with increased business activity.  

Operating cash flow was approximately $1.8 billion for 2009, a decrease of $58 million, or approximately 3% as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 and to a lesser extent attributable to the year-over-year incremental amount of cash paid related to the Companys restructuring activities. In addition, the Company voluntarily contributed $60 million to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2009 while it made no contribution in 2008. The declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by cash generated from the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable which contributed $228 million of cash flow during 2009 as compared to contributing $108 million of cash flow during 2008. Increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels (partially offset by reductions in accounts payable) associated with lower levels of business activity benefited cash flow in 2009 as compared to 2008. A decline of approximately $100 million in tax payments during 2009 as compared to 2008 also partially offset the decline in operating cash flow.  

In connection with the Companys restructuring activities, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities, severing personnel and, in connection with acquisitions, integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with these activities. During 2010, the Company paid approximately $110 million related to its 2009 restructuring activities. During 2009, the Company paid approximately $161 million related to its 2009 and 2008 restructuring activities and approximately $29 million related to restructuring activities associated with acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008. Please refer to Note 2 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these expenditures.  

Investing Activities  

Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion during 2010 compared to $943 million of net cash used in 2009. Gross capital spending of $217 million during 2010 was approximately $29 million more than gross capital spending during 2009. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In 2011, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $250 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.  

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $943 million in 2009 compared to approximately $567 in 2008. Gross capital spending of $194 million in 2009 decreased approximately $5 million from 2008 capital spending levels.  

As discussed below, the Company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2010, 2009 and 2008. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

2010 Acquisitions and Apex Joint Venture  

For a discussion of the Companys 2010 acquisitions and the 2010 formation of the Apex joint venture, please refer to Overview  Acquisitions; Joint Venture with Cooper Industries plc.  

2009 Acquisitions/Divestitures  

The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, Industrial Technologies, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million.  

In addition, during 2009 the Company divested five businesses or product lines for approximately $10 million of net cash proceeds. The divested businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies and the former Tools and Components segments and had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $53 million in 2009. The Company recorded no significant gain or loss, either individually or in the aggregate, associated with these divestitures. The Company used the proceeds from these sales for general corporate purposes.  

2008 Acquisitions  

The Company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These companies were acquired to complement existing units of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, Industrial Technologies, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million.  

Financing Activities and Indebtedness  

Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $117 million during 2010 compared to $407 million of cash provided during 2009. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (described below) during 2009 partially offset by lower repayments of borrowings during 2010 as compared to 2009.  

Total debt was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The Companys debt as of December 31, 2010 was as follows:  

       $180 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper;  

       $669 million (500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (Eurobond Notes);  

       $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 (2018 Notes);  

       $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes);  

       $573 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (LYONs); and  

       $152 million of other borrowings.

For additional details regarding the Companys debt as of December 31, 2010, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except in connection with the change of control provisions described as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. The Companys outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Companys operations and as of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility  

The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro denominated commercial paper. Under the Companys U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the Credit Facilities (described below) provide credit support for the program, the $1.525 billion of availability under the Credit Facilities has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $1.525 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.  

Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with a syndicate of banks that expires on April 25, 2012 and an unsecured $75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on May 3, 2011 (the Supplemental Credit Facility and together with the Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Companys option (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, (2) a formula based on the higher (as of the date of determination) of Bank of Americas prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. Under the Supplemental Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Companys option (1) a LIBOR-based formula, or (2) a formula based on the highest (as of the date of determination) of the lenders prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points. Both of the Credit Facilities require the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus stockholders equity) as of the last day of each quarter of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. The availability of the Credit Facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program. We expect to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facilities to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. The Company anticipates seeking a renewal of the term of the Supplemental Credit Facility from the lender prior to its scheduled expiration.  

During 2010, the Company refinanced balances under its commercial paper program as they came due to maintain an outstanding balance throughout the year. Amounts outstanding under the Companys U.S. dollar commercial paper program as of December 31, 2010 had a weighted average interest rate of 0.25% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 11 days. The Company had no outstanding Euro denominated commercial paper as of December 31, 2010.  

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Companys ability to issue commercial paper. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and our Credit Facilities to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our Credit Facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.

In addition to the Credit Facilities, the Company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit.  

Other Long-Term Indebtedness  

In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019. The notes were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper with the balance of the net proceeds used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 40 basis points.  

In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points.  

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed.  

In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs that were originally issued, approximately 24.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million shares of Danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. From January 1, 2011 through February 11, 2011, holders of certain of the Companys Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of approximately 5.2 million shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2010, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders had the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2011, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of approximately $13 thousand being redeemed by the Company for cash. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.  

Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $2.1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2010. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.

Shelf Registration Statement  

The Company has a well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include, but are not limited to, reduction or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; share repurchases and dividends; and working capital.  

Stock Repurchase Program  

On May 11, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (which repurchase program replaces the repurchase program that was authorized by the Board in April 2005). There is no expiration date for the Companys repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys equity compensation plans (or any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes.  

The Company did not repurchase any shares of Company common stock during 2010 or 2009. During 2008, the Company repurchased 2.76 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $74 million, under the Companys prior stock repurchase program. The 2008 repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2010, 20 million shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to this program. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Companys available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.  

Dividends  

The Company declared a regular dividend of $0.02 per share that was paid on January 28, 2011 to holders of record on December 31, 2010. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2010 were approximately $52 million.  

Cash and Cash Requirements  

The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its existing commercial paper programs or the Credit Facilities, enter into new credit facilities in order to expand borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and issue commercial paper in amounts in excess of the programs current capacity and/or access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. We also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. As of December 31, 2010, the Company held $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an average weighted annual interest rate of 0.4%.  

The Companys cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2010, approximately $1.4 billion of the Companys cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States although under current law would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Companys operations.

During 2010, the Company contributed $90 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2011, the Companys cash contribution requirements are expected to be approximately $50 million for its U.S. plan, although the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plans funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors. The Company expects to contribute approximately $27 million in employer contributions and unfunded benefit payments to the non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2011.  

Contractual Obligations  

The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $389 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.  

 (c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2010. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.  

 (d) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above.  

 (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  

 (f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon managements estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company as of December 31, 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components and for performance under specific sales agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities.  

Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe that any such liability will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Companys products or claims alleging that Company products infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company cannot estimate its maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions and has not accrued any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our contractual commitments table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.  

The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danahers Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.  

Legal Proceedings  

Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters.  

55  

Table of Contents 

In addition to the litigation matters noted under Item 1. Business  Regulatory Matters  Environmental, Health & Safety and Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon the Companys experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position or results of operations.  

While the Company maintains general, products, property, workers compensation, automobile, cargo, aviation, crime, fiduciary and directors and officers liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) up to certain limits that cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. For general and products liability and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (stop loss insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses.  

The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate recognizes a reserve for these contingencies. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Companys specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The Company believes the liability recorded for such contingencies as of December 31, 2010 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the Companys self-insurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate, it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings. Please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability.  

For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments.  

The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made, and (2) material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent managements best estimate of the credit losses expected from the Companys trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. The level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously written-off accounts increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserves would be required.  

Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.  

Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and acquired technology, over the estimated useful life of the identified asset. On an annual basis (the first day of the Companys fiscal fourth quarter) the Company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the fair value of each unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting units goodwill has been impaired. If circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that, in managements judgment, it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on EBITDA multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Companys reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data. The Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach in certain circumstances. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The  

57  

Table of Contents 

 discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, if actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.  

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 27 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from approximately $6.6 million to approximately $2.1 billion. The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2010 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Companys reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 16% to approximately 617%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Companys reporting units ranged from approximately 4% to approximately 545%.  

Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above under Legal Proceedings, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed above under Legal Proceedings. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.  

Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. See Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Companys revenue recognition policies. Although most of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For delivered elements, sales are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value, fair values of undelivered elements are known, there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized for delivered elements.  

Share-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. For a discussion of the Companys share-based compensation accounting practices, please see Note 16 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Companys equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If the Companys actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate, the Companys earnings may be significantly impacted as the Company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Companys employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company measures its pension and post retirement plans assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan. The Company recognizes an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status in its statement of financial position. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income. Accounting standards require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations.  

Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, changes in the assumptions (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For the U.S. plan, the Company used a 5.2% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2010, which represents a decrease of 55 basis points in the discount rate from December 31, 2009. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. net obligation by $59 million ($40 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2010.  

For 2010, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the U.S. plan has been estimated at 8%. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2010 would have increased $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis). The Companys non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 7.20% for 2010 and ranged from 0.75% to 8.0% for 2009.

Income Taxes: The Companys income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Companys tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies, and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the Companys tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company generally re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when (i) there is completion of tax audit; (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations.

An increase in our nominal tax rate of 1.0 percent would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $23 million.  

New Accounting Standards  

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. This ASU establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendors multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. Concurrent with the issuance of ASU No. 2009-13, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements. This ASU changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality, and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality. The amendments will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the provisions of these updated accounting standards related to revenue recognition associated with contractual arrangements involving multiple elements and contractual arrangements involving tangible products that include software. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified transactions in any given period.
