ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Executive Overview  

Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.  

To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organizations core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.  

Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Companys sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Companys exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.  

The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hills also competes on a worldwide basis, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers.  

On an on-going basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Companys corporate governance practices (including the Companys Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained.  

To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Companys products.  

The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.  

Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its household bleach businesses in Latin America and Canada. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. In the Latin American countries, the transaction closed during the first quarter of 2007 with the exception of Colombia, where the transaction did not receive regulatory approval and the parties have agreed not to proceed with the sale. Also consistent with this strategy the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy-duty laundry detergent brands during 2005.

The Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc. in 2006. This acquisition allowed the Company to enter the fast-growing health and specialty trade channel in the U.S. where Toms of Maine toothpaste and deodorants are market leaders.  

The Companys previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. On April 24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December 31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). Once all projects are implemented, savings are projected to be in the range of $425 and $475 ($325 and $350 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which is expected to increase future cash flows.  

Looking forward into 2008, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, the Company believes it is well positioned for continued growth. As further explained in the Outlook section of Part II, Item 7, of this report, over the long-term, the Companys continued focus on its consumer products business, the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.  

Results of Operations  

Net Sales  

Worldwide Net sales were $13,789.7 in 2007, up 12.5% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 6.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.0%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses in 2007 and 2006, respectively, reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007, by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.0% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.0%.  

Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $11,930.6 in 2007, up 13.0% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 7.0%, net selling price increases of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.5%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007, by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.5% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.5%.  

Net sales in Hills Pet Nutrition were $1,859.1 in 2007, up 11.5% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%.  

In 2006, worldwide Net sales were $12,237.7, up 7.5% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5%. The 2005 divestment of the Companys heavy-duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2006, by 1.5% versus the comparable period of 2005. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestments, sales increased 9.0% in 2006 on volume growth of 7.0%.  

Gross Profit  

Worldwide gross profit margin was 56.2% in 2007, 54.8% in 2006 and 54.4% in 2005. In 2007, Gross profit benefited from a continued focus on cost-savings programs, lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program and the shift toward higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and   

14  

Table of Contents 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

 packaging material costs. The increase in gross profit margin in 2006 from 2005 was driven by the benefits from higher pricing, a continued focus on cost-savings programs and a shift towards higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs and increased charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program.  

Restructuring and related implementation charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $153.8, $196.2 and $100.2, respectively. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing manufacturing facilities, start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities, accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 110 basis points (bps), 160 bps and 90 bps in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin increased to 57.3% in 2007 as compared to 56.4% in 2006 and 55.3% in 2005.  

For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 36.1% in 2007, 35.6% in 2006 and 34.4% in 2005. The 50 bps increase in 2007 was driven primarily by increased advertising (40 bps) and an increase in shipping and handling costs. Advertising increased 17% to $1,545.7 as compared to 2006, on top of an 11% increase in the year-ago period. During 2007, the increase in gross profit margin and other savings programs funded an increase in advertising, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 increased by a net 120 bps as compared to 2005, primarily due to increased advertising (30 bps), charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program (40 bps) and incremental stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) (60 bps). Selling, general and administrative expenses include charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $49.1 in 2007, $46.1 in 2006 and $1.8 in 2005.  

Other (Income) Expense, Net  

Other (income) expense, net was $121.3, $185.9 and $69.2 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As noted in the preceding table, Other (income) expense, net in 2007 included a gain on the sale of the Companys household bleach business in Latin America, which was offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products (see the   

15  

Table of Contents 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

 Segment Results section, below, for further information regarding the voluntary recall) and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of lump sum payments of normal retirement benefits associated with a nonqualified retirement plan in the U.S. as required by SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits (SFAS 88 charges).  

Other (income) expense, net in 2006 included a gain on the sale of the Companys household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program.  

Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain on the sale of heavy-duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Companys international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by SFAS 88.  

Investment losses (income) consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, principally due to declines and increases in the fair value of foreign-denominated deposits, which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting.  

Operating Profit  

In 2007, Operating profit increased 23% to $2,653.1 as compared to $2,160.5 in 2006 and decreased 2% in 2006 as compared to $2,215.0 in 2005. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost-saving initiatives. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to a higher gross profit margin and a decrease in charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $136.9. These items were partially offset by higher advertising, the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products.  

In 2006, Operating profit decreased 2% to $2,160.5 as compared to $2,215.0 in 2005, primarily due to an increase in charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $212.6, lower gains on sale of non-core product lines of $101.4 and incremental stock-based compensation expense of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. Operating profit in 2005 included $34.0 of charges related to the re-measurement of certain pension obligations; there was no comparable amount in 2006.  

Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net was $156.6 in 2007 compared with $158.7 in 2006 and $136.0 in 2005. The increase in Interest expense, net from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher average interest rates in 2006.  

Income Taxes   

The effective income tax rate was 30.4% in 2007, 32.4% in 2006 and 35.0% in 2005. The tax rate in all years was impacted by the benefits of global tax planning strategies, the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, gains on asset sales and other one-time items. The 2007 effective tax rate of 30.4% reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $73.9 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $94.6 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and an increase of 40 bps from the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. The 2006 effective income tax rate of 32.4% reflects an 80 bps increase from the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a decrease of 30 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Canada. Also increasing the 2007 effective rate is the cost associated with higher remittances from overseas subsidiaries and the one-time impact of statutory tax rate changes in certain overseas subsidiaries.

The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2007, 2006 and 2005 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 28.9%, 27.6% and 20.6%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%.  

For additional information regarding the Companys income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net Income  

Net income was $1,737.4 in 2007 or $3.20 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,353.4 in 2006 or $2.46 per share and $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share. Net income in 2007 included a $29.7 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $73.9 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above. Such benefits were more than offset by $183.7 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, $10.0 ($0.02 per share) of SFAS 88 charges and $8.2 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products. Net income in 2006 included a $38.2 ($0.07 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and $48.1 ($0.09 per share) of incremental stock-based compensation charges due to the adoption of SFAS 123R as compared to 2005. In 2005, Net income was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, gains on sales of certain non-core product lines, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) and certain pension charges.  

Segment Results  

The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Pet Nutrition  

Net sales for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 11.5% in 2007 to $1,859.1 on volume gains of 3.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 5.5% and 2.5% positive impact of foreign exchange. Sales growth within the U.S. specialty pet channel was driven by Science Diet Adult Large Breed Canine, Science Diet Lamb Meal & Rice Adult Small Bites Canine and Science Diet Natures Best Canine with upgraded all natural ingredients. Science Diet Indoor Cat and Science Diet Light contributed to growth in feline products. Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline, Prescription Diet j/d Canine and new Prescription Diet Hypoallergenic Treats for dogs and cats contributed to growth in the U.S. veterinary channel. Internationally, growth was led by South Africa, the Nordic region, Australia, Spain and Russia. New pet food products contributing to the international growth include Prescription Diet j/d Light Canine, Science Plan Chunks in Gravy Feline pouches and Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline. In 2006, Net sales for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 10.0% to $1,669.1 on volume gains of 6.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 4.5%, offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange.  

Like most major North American pet food producers, Hills Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations pet food recall in March 2007. Hills took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hills Pet Nutritions annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Companys 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hills Pet Nutritions Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment.  

Operating profit increased 9% to $487.8 in 2007 due to increased sales offset by higher agricultural commodities costs. In 2006, Operating profit grew 9% to $447.9 due to increased sales, partially offset by higher advertising.  

Corporate  

Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($634.1), ($670.3) and ($306.8) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Corporate operations include research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets and certain SFAS 88 charges. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2007 decreased as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by higher costs resulting from supply chain globalization initiatives implemented under the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and increases in research and development costs and other new product initiatives. In addition, 2007 includes the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the negative impact of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products.  

The increase in Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges and incremental stock-based compensation of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R and lower gains on the sale of certain non-core product lines. In 2005, Corporate Operating profit (loss) included the remeasurement of certain pension obligations as required by SFAS 88.

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

Corporate Operating profit (loss) includes charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $258.5 in 2007, $395.4 in 2006 and $182.8 in 2005. Charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were higher in 2006 as a result of the charges related to the voluntary early retirement program applicable to certain U.S. employees, which was implemented in 2006.  

For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges, below, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Net sales and volume growth both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions are discussed in this Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from on-going operations. Worldwide Gross profit margin is discussed in this Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of restructuring charges (non-GAAP). Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Companys on-going operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. While the Company believes that this financial measure is useful in evaluating the Companys business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  

2004 Restructuring Program  

The Companys previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. As part of this program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets.  

On April 24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December 31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). It is estimated that the total cumulative pretax charges of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program, once completed, will be comprised of the following: termination benefits (40%), incremental depreciation (20%), asset impairments (5%) and other charges consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The estimated cost in 2008 is between $95 and $170 ($70 and $125 aftertax). Once all projects are implemented, savings are projected to be in the range of $425 and $475 ($325 and $350 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which is expected to increase future cash flows.  

During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/

 Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to manufacture toothpaste more cost effectively, by taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies.  

The Company is in the process of consolidating toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Poland. Upon completion of the consolidation project within 2008, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Companys facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Brasov, Romania and Gebze, Turkey. Toothpaste manufacturing has already ceased at Anzio, Italy. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company ceased production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana, plant in December 2007 and transferred production of the Companys market-leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility in Morristown, Tennessee, and relocated other production and administrative services performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Companys Kansas City, Kansas facility, formerly the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to a U.S. third-party manufacturer.  

In 2006, the Company continued with the implementation of previously announced projects, most notably the changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. In addition, the Company implemented several other projects, including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re-align organizational resources consistent with its business-building goals. Also consistent with its global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. During 2007, the Company continued to exit certain manufacturing activities and to re-align organizational resources in various locations throughout the world consistent with its business-building goals.  

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Restructuring charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

Total 2007 charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (22%), Latin America (3%), Greater Asia/Africa (14%) and Corporate (25%). Total program-to-date accumulated charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (38%), Europe/South Pacific (29%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (9%) and Corporate (20%). Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $905.4 ($663.1 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana, oral care facility; the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Denmark, Puerto Rico, Senegal and Kansas City, Kansas; and the realignment of sales, administrative and research and development functions in various locations around the world.  

The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring charges discussed above and related accrual:

Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements of $14.1 and $98.4 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets. In 2007 and 2006, Termination benefits also include $2.2 and $10.0, respectively, of charges related to other retiree benefit enhancements and are reflected in Other charges as an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities. In 2007 and 2006, the Company made voluntary contributions of $34.5 and $85.0, respectively, to partially fund this obligation. The Company anticipates that it will continue to make incremental cash contributions to its plans in order to fund its restructuring-related pension obligations over the duration of the 2004 Restructuring Program.  

Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.  

Other charges primarily consist of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges include ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007 charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $33.2, and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $37.9. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $40.7 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $70.3 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. All costs relating to start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives are expensed as incurred.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company expects cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Companys strong cash-generating capability and financial condition also allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide.  

Cash Flow  

Net cash provided by operations in 2007 was $2,203.7 as compared with $1,821.5 in 2006 and $1,784.4 in 2005. The increase in 2007 reflects the Companys improved profitability, decreased spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program and changes in working capital, offset by a decrease in net deferred income tax liabilities.  

The Companys working capital as a percentage of Net sales improved to 2.2% in 2007 as compared with 2.3% in 2006. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Companys working capital changes were driven by higher levels of payables and accruals, primarily due to the timing of tax payments and higher advertising, offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales in 2007. Days sales outstanding decreased slightly as compared to 2006. The inventory days coverage ratio increased to 73 in 2007 as compared to 69 in 2006 to ensure continued product supply during plant closings under the 2004 Restructuring Program.

With the progression of the 2004 Restructuring Program, pretax restructuring charges decreased $136.9, and cash spending decreased $12.8 in 2007 relative to the comparable period of 2006. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2007, will be paid out before year end 2008. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2004 Restructuring Program will continue to be funded from operating cash flows.  

Investing activities used $528.3 of cash during 2007 compared with uses of $620.4 and $220.7 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in uses as compared to 2006 is primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions and higher proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.  

In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $26.5. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc., for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, in 2006 the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary.  

Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain non-core product lines. Investing activities in 2007 include $66.5 of net proceeds from the sale of the Companys Latin American household bleach business and $43.2 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities include $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Canadian household bleach business in 2006 and $215.6 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Southeast Asian and North American heavy-duty detergent brands in 2005.  

Capital expenditures were $583.1, $476.4 and $389.2 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital spending is trending upwards as a result of the Companys multi-year restructuring and business-building program and continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to remain consistent at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales.  

Financing activities used $1,754.4 of cash during 2007 compared to $1,059.0 and $1,524.4 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to higher purchases of treasury shares and a net reduction of debt. The decrease in 2006 was primarily related to proceeds from exercise of stock options and proceeds from debt.  

The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March 31, 2006. The Company completed this program in the first quarter of 2006. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2006 Program) under which the Company may purchase up to 30 million common shares. On January 30, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the 2008 Program) that replaces the 2006 Program and authorizes the Company to purchase up to 30 million common shares. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 15.8 million common shares under the 2006 Program and 5.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $1,269.4. Aggregate repurchases in 2006 included 14.0 million common shares under the 2004 and 2006 Programs and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $884.7. Aggregate repurchases in 2005 included 14.0 million common shares under the 2004 Program and 1.1 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $796.2.  

Dividend payments in 2007 were $749.6, up from $677.8 in 2006 and $607.2 in 2005. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.40 per share in 2007 from $1.25 per share in 2006 and $1.11 per share in

 2005. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments increased to $11.20 per share in 2007 from $10.00 per share in 2006 and $8.88 per share in 2005. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations.  

In 2005, financing activities reflect a cash payment of $89.7 to an outside investor as a result of the discontinuation of a financing subsidiary of the Company. The Company previously had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors, the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Companys receivables and thereby give the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest.  

Long-term debt decreased to $3,360.0 as of December 31, 2007 as compared to $3,497.1 as of December 31, 2006 and total debt decreased to $3,515.9 as of December 31, 2007 as compared to $3,671.2 as of December 31, 2006. The Companys long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. During 2007, the Company issued 250 million of Euro-denominated medium term notes (approximately $365 at the December 31, 2007 exchange rate) maturing in June 2014, at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S.-denominated commercial paper. During 2005, the Company issued 250 million of Swiss franc-denominated five-year bonds (approximately $221 at the December 31, 2007 exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%.  

Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $478.8 and $651.6 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2007 and 2006 was approximately $1,700 and $1,400, respectively. The average daily balance outstanding for U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper in 2007 and 2006 was $872.0 and $766.1, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A-1+ and a Moodys Investors Service rating of P-1. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $478.8 and $674.0, respectively, were classified as long-term debt, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2012.  

At December 31, 2007, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,752.3 and also had $1,052.2 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Companys domestic lines of credit include a five-year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0, which was extended an additional year in the fourth quarter of 2007 and now expires in November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance.  

The long-term notes of the Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that are guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote.

The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  (1)    Long-term debt due in 2008 includes $478.8 of commercial paper that has been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2007, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2012.  

  (2)    Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on managements best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.  

  (3)    The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2007 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.  

  (4)    Long-term liabilities associated with the Companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates, below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2015. Managements best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2008, is approximately $95, including approximately $16 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $53 of projected contributions to the Companys postretirement plans and approximately $42 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans.  

As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.  

Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure  

The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of   

27  

Table of Contents 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

 techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes.  

As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Companys major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe, Asia/Africa and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.  

The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options with durations no greater than 18 months.  

Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility.  

The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2007, the results of the Companys commodity hedging activities were not material.  

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher.  

Value at Risk  

The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity-based financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates.  

The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate, foreign exchange rate or commodity-based instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2007 and 2006. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, or commodity-based instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations in 2007 and 2006. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with certain requirements being effective in fiscal years beginning after 2008. The Company does not expect that SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. Certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred, and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 160 and does not expect it will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.  

       Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 790 bps from 56.2% to 48.3% in 2007 and decreased 770 bps and 750 bps in 2006 and 2005, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.  

       The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2007, 2006 and 2005 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.  

The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies.  

       In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 6.50%, 5.80% and 5.50% as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Companys international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys pension and other postretirement plans.)  

       The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 10% for 2008, declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $7.  

       Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-

 Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards under SFAS 123R. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $12.72. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 13%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%.  

       Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires managements best estimate of net realizable value.  

       The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement.  

       Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.  

       Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.)  

The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.)  

Outlook  

Looking forward into 2008, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. In order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share, the Company anticipates continuing to prioritize investments in key categories and markets and increasing momentum against its strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and our customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Companys other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability.

However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long-term, the Companys continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.
