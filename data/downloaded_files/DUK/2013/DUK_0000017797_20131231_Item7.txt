ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment income, discussed below. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

The following combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. However, none of the registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.  

DUKE ENERGY  

Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke Energy Indiana, as well as in Latin America.  

When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which, along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. 

Executive Overview  

Merger with Progress Energy 

On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy, with Duke Energy continuing as the surviving corporation, and Progress Energy becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, Progress Energy’s regulated utility subsidiaries, are now indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy. Duke Energy’s consolidated financial statements include Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida activity beginning July 2, 2012. 

Immediately preceding the merger, Duke Energy completed a one-for-three reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock. All share and per share amounts presented herein reflect the impact of the one-for-three reverse stock split. 

For additional information on the details of this transaction including regulatory conditions and accounting implications, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses and Sales of Other Assets.” 

2013 Financial Results  

The following table summarizes adjusted earnings and net income attributable to Duke Energy for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted earnings increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Progress Energy results in 2013, the impact of the revised rates, net of higher depreciation and amortization expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). Adjusted earnings increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of Progress Energy’s results beginning July 2012, and the impact of the 2011 Duke Energy Carolina’s rate cases.  

See “Results of Operations” below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations, as well as a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy’s reportable business segments, as well as Other.  

2013 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments  

In 2013, Duke Energy was focused on completing the fleet modernization program, achieving constructive outcomes in its rate cases, resolving key issues – including the future Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear station, improving nuclear fleet performance, and realizing merger integration plans. 

Completing the Fleet Modernization Program 

35  

PART II  

During 2013, Duke Energy completed its $9 billion fleet modernization program. This program added approximately 6,600 MWs of new combined-cycle natural gas and state-of-the-art coal capacity in North Carolina, South Carolina and Indiana. This new generation will replace up to 6,700 MW of older coal and oil plants, already retired or scheduled for retirement by 2015. The Edwardsport IGCC and Sutton combined-cycle natural gas plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, were placed in commercial service in June and November, respectively. 

At Edwardsport, Duke Energy has been testing, tuning and optimizing the unit. All major technology systems have been validated. Performance testing was delayed in January by extreme weather, which also caused some equipment issues that are being resolved. The Edwardsport IGCC project is expected to achieve its full operational capabilities later this year and to be completed within the revised cost estimate of $3.5 billion.  

Achieving Constructive Outcomes in Rate Cases 

Duke Energy reached constructive regulatory outcomes in all five of its general rate cases to recover investments made to modernize its fleet. When fully implemented, the base rate cases will add approximately $600 million in annualized revenues, while keeping customers’ retail priced below national averages. 

Resolving Key Issues 

Duke Energy also made the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, resolved insurance claims with its insurance provider, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), and obtained approval from the FPSC of a comprehensive settlement. This settlement agreement addressed cost recovery of the nuclear unit, Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units, and the proposed Levy Nuclear Station (Levy). The settlement agreement also provides for new generation in the latter half of this decade to meet customer demand.  

Improving Nuclear Fleet Performance 

In 2013, Duke Energy’s nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.8 percent, the 15th consecutive year with a capacity factor over 90 percent. Duke Energy has made targeted investments at nuclear stations to bring the entire fleet to consistent level of excellent performance. In particular, the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) completed a record continuous run of 531 days before beginning a scheduled refueling outage in September. This complemented the record of continuous runs achieved at Oconee Nuclear Station Units 2 and Unit 3.  

Realizing Merger Integration Plans 

Duke Energy expects to exceed its original targets for fuel and joint-dispatch savings, which benefit customers in the North Carolina and South Carolina. Through 2013, Duke Energy has recorded approximately $190 million of cumulative fuel and joint-dispatch savings since the merger closed. In addition, approximately 65 percent of the total guaranteed savings of $687 million have been contractually locked-in or generated. 

Duke Energy is also realizing cost synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and has exceed the original target of five to seven percent in non-fuel operating and maintenance savings. Duke Energy is on pace to deliver about nine percent, or approximately $550 million, of non-fuel operating and maintenance expense in 2014.  

2014 Objectives  

Duke Energy is dedicated to the energy experience that customers value and trust. Duke Energy strives for leadership and excellence that benefit customers, shareholders and employees. Objectives for 2014 are: 

· Continue to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-decile safety results, 

· Develop and engage employees, 

· Deliver new value by improving the customer experience and advancing more flexible regulatory models,  

· Establish a rigorous process for managing business and financial performance to deliver customer value at a competitive price, 

· Successfully complete 2014 integration milestones and continue innovative use of technology to deliver value, 

· Achieve 2014 financial goals, including delivering adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.45 - $4.60, and advance viable future growth opportunities for regulated and nonregulated businesses,  and 

· Serve as a respected leading voice in helping to shape national and state energy policies. 

Due to the forward-looking nature of the adjusted diluted EPS range, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as Duke Energy is unable to forecast all special items, the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment, or any amounts that may be reported as discontinued operations or extraordinary items for future periods. 

Results of Operations  

In this section, Duke Energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). These items are measured as income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. Mark-to-market adjustments reflect the impact of derivative contracts, which are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until  

36  

PART II  

settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Board of Directors, employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energy’s financial performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and discontinued operations. 

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. 

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments,” for a discussion of Duke Energy’s segment structure. 

Overview 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily due to:  

· The inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013; 

· Increased retail pricing and riders resulting primarily from the implementation of revised rates in all jurisdictions; and 

37  

PART II  

· Lower operating and maintenance expense resulting primarily from the adoption of nuclear outage cost levelization in the Carolinas, lower benefit costs and merger synergies.  

Partially offsetting these increases was: 

· Higher depreciation and amortization expense; 

· Lower AFUDC;  

· Lower nonregulated Midwest gas generation results; and  

· Incremental shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share amounts only).  

The variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily due to:  

· The inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012; and 

· Increased retail pricing and riders primarily resulting from the implementation of revised rates in North Carolina and South Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas.  

Partially offsetting these increases was: 

· Unfavorable weather in 2012 compared to 2011;  

· Higher depreciation and amortization expense; 

· Lower nonregulated Midwest coal generation results; and  

· Incremental shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share amounts only).  

Segment Results 

The remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. 

Regulated Utilities  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012  

Regulated Utilities’ results were positively impacted by 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, higher retail pricing and rate riders, the inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013, a net increase in wholesale power revenues, and higher weather normal sales volumes. These impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense, Crystal River Unit 3  

38  

PART II  

charges, lower AFUDC equity and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $4,339 million increase due to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013,  

· A $434 million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to revised rates approved in all jurisdictions; 

· A $76 million net increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to additional volumes and charges for capacity for customers served under long-term contracts; and  

· A $72 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand. 

Partially offset by:  

· A $132 million decrease in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by (i) the impact of lower Florida residential fuel rates, including amortization associated with the settlement agreement approved by the FPSC in 2012 (2012 Settlement), (ii) lower fuel rates for electric retail customers in the Carolinas, Florida and Ohio, and (iii) lower revenues for purchased power, partially offset by (iv) increased demand from electric retail customers. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $3,393 million increase due to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013,  

· A $346 million increase in impairment and other charges in 2013 primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information, and 

· A $102 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement.  

Partially offset by:  

· A $600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information, and 

· A $120 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds in Florida, including amortization associated with the 2012 Settlement; (ii) lower purchased power costs in (a) the Carolinas, primarily due to additional generating capacity placed in service in late 2012 and market conditions, (b) Ohio, primarily due to reduced sales volumes, and (c) Indiana, reflective of market conditions; partially offset by (iii) higher volumes of natural gas used in electric generation due primarily to additional generating capacity placed in service; (iv) higher prices for natural gas and coal used in electric generation; and (v) higher volumes of coal used in electric generation primarily due to generation mix.  

Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease is primarily due to lower AFUDC equity, resulting from major projects that were placed into service in late 2012 and the implementation of new customer rates related to the IGCC rider, partially offset by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013.  

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily driven by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013.  

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and a reduction in AFUDC equity. 

Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011  

Regulated Utilities’ results were positively impacted by the inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012, higher net retail pricing and rate riders and decreased operating and maintenance expenses. These impacts were partially offset by additional charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, unfavorable weather, and increased depreciation and amortization.  

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $4,918 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of Progress Energy beginning in July 2012; 

· A $352 million net increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to revised retail rates resulting from the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases implemented in the first quarter of 2012, and revenues recognized for energy efficiency programs; and 

· A $293 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by higher revenues in Ohio for purchases of power as a result of the Ohio Electric Stabilization Plan (ESP), higher fuel rates for electric retail customers in all jurisdictions, and higher revenues for purchases of power in Indiana and the Carolinas, partially offset by decreased demand from electric retail customers in 2012 mainly due to unfavorable weather conditions, and lower demand and fuel rates in Ohio and Kentucky from natural gas retail customers. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers. 

Partially offset by:  

· A $155 million decrease in electric and gas sales (net of fuel) to retail customers due to unfavorable weather conditions in 2012 compared to 2011. For the Carolinas, weather statistics for cooling degree days in 2012 were less favorable compared to 2011, while  

39  

PART II  

cooling degree days in Ohio and Indiana were favorable in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. For the Carolinas, Ohio and Indiana, weather statistics for heating degree days in 2012 were unfavorable compared to 2011. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $3,845 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of Progress Energy beginning in July 2012; 

· A $378 million increase due to additional charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant that was under construction. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information; 

· A $277 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to higher purchases of power in Ohio as a result of the new Ohio ESP, higher volumes of natural gas used in electric generation, higher coal prices, higher purchased power costs in Indiana and the Carolinas, partially offset by lower volume of coal used in electric generation resulting from unfavorable weather conditions and lower coal-fired generation due to low natural gas prices, lower prices for natural gas used in electric generation, and lower gas volumes and prices to full-service retail gas customers; and 

· A $105 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of regulatory assets.  

Partially offset by:  

· A $99 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter of 2012, pursuant to regulatory orders, for future recovery of certain employee severance costs related to the 2010 voluntary severance plan and other costs, and lower storm costs, partially offset by increased costs associated with the energy-efficiency programs.  

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance was driven primarily by the inclusion of Progress Energy beginning in July 2012.  

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily driven by the inclusion of Progress Energy beginning in July 2012.  

Income Tax Expense. The variance is primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 35 percent and 36.3 percent, respectively.  

Matters Impacting Future Regulated Utilities Results 

Appeals of recently approved rate cases are pending at the North Carolina Supreme Court. The North Carolina Attorney General (NCAG) and NC Waste Awareness and Reduction Network (NC WARN) dispute the rate of return, capital structure and other matters approved by the NCUC. The outcome of these appeals could have an adverse impact to Regulated Utilities’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information. 

On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. For additional information related to the ash basin release, see “Other Issues” in this section. 

International Energy  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 

International Energy’s results were negatively impacted by an extended outage at NMC and unfavorable exchange rates in Latin America, partially offset by the acquisition of Iberoamericana de Energía Ibener, S.A. (Ibener) in 2012 and higher average prices and lower purchased power costs in Brazil. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $67 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar, 

· A $53 million decrease in Central America due to lower average prices and volumes, and 

· An $18 million decrease in Argentina as a result of unfavorable exchange rates. 

40  

PART II  

Partially offset by:  

· A $67 million increase in Brazil due to higher average prices, net of lower volumes, and 

· A $65 million increase in Chile as a result of asset acquisitions in 2012. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $65 million decrease in Central America due to lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher purchased power and coal consumption, and 

· A $20 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar and lower purchased power partially offset by higher variable costs. 

Partially offset by:  

· A $36 million increase in Chile as a result of acquisitions in 2012. 

Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease was primarily driven by a net currency remeasurement loss in Latin America due to strengthening of the dollar, and lower equity earnings at NMC as a result of lower MTBE average prices and lower volumes due to extended maintenance, partially offset by lower butane costs. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to the Chile acquisitions in 2012, partially offset by favorable exchange rates and lower inflation in Brazil. 

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 28.3 percent and 24.8 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in countries with higher tax rates.  

Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011  

International Energy’s results were negatively impacted by unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil, a 2011 Peru arbitration award, and lower margins in Central America, partially offset by higher average prices and volumes in Brazil and higher average prices in Peru. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $53 million increase in Central America as a result of higher volumes due to a full year of commercial operations of the Las Palmas II plant and favorable hydrology, 

· A $24 million increase in Peru due to higher average prices, and 

· A $10 million increase in Argentina due to higher volumes as a result of favorable hydrology, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $76 million increase in Central America due to higher fuel costs and consumption as a result of increased dispatch. 

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance was primarily driven by the absence of a $20 million arbitration award in Peru. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to lower capitalized interest in Central America and Brazil, as well as higher inflation partially offset by favorable exchange rates in Brazil. 

Income Tax Expense. The variance in tax expense is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 24.8 percent and 28.9 percent, respectively.  

Commercial Power [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

41  

PART II  

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012  

Commercial Power’s results were negatively impacted by lower PJM capacity revenues and lower income from the renewables portfolio and gas-fired generation assets. These impacts are partially offset by higher income tax benefits and higher income from the coal-fired generation assets. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $102 million increase in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power and capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market gains of $96 million in 2013 compared to losses of $6 million in 2012; 

· A $68 million increase for the gas-fired generation assets driven primarily by higher power prices, partially offset by decreased volumes; and 

· A $67 million increase due to higher volumes in the renewables portfolio. 

Partially offset by:  

· An $85 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared capacity auction pricing; and  

· An $81 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $109 million increase in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets driven by higher average natural gas prices per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), partially offset by decreased natural gas volumes; and 

· A $96 million increase in net mark-to-market fuel expenses on non-qualifying fuel hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $99 million in 2013 compared to losses of $3 million in 2012. 

(Losses) Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The variance is attributable to a loss recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013 and a gain on the 2012 contribution of certain renewable assets to a joint venture. 

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance is primarily due to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012, lower interest income and lower equity earnings from the renewables portfolio. 

Income Tax Benefit. The variance was primarily due to a decrease in both pretax income and manufacturing deductions combined with higher production tax credits in 2013. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 97.2 percent and (9.5) percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the period was primarily due to a pretax loss in 2013 compared to pretax income in 2012.  

Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011  

Commercial Power’s results were negatively impacted by the net impact of the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP and the impact of competitive market dispatch for the coal-fired assets, lower Duke Energy Retail earnings, and lower PJM capacity revenues. These impacts were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower impairment charges, and increased margins from the gas-fired generation assets. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $285 million decrease for the coal-fired generation assets driven primarily by the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP, net of stability charge revenues under the 2012-2014 ESP, partially offset by participating in the PJM wholesale energy market in 2012; 

· A $116 million decrease for Duke Energy Retail resulting from lower volumes and unfavorable pricing; 

· A $39 million decrease for the gas-fired generation assets driven primarily by lower power prices, partially offset by increased volumes; 

· A $27 million decrease due primarily to the termination of certain non-core operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and a reduction of coal sales volumes as a result of lower natural gas prices; 

· An $18 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared capacity auction pricing in 2012 compared to 2011 for the gas-fired generation assets, net of an increase associated with the move of the coal-fired generation assets from Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) to PJM in 2012; and 

· An $8 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power and capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $6 million in 2012 compared to gains of $2 million in 2011. 

Partially offset by:  

· A $64 million increase from participation in competitive retail load auctions; and 

· A $17 million increase from higher production in the renewables portfolio. 

42  

PART II  

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:  

· A $140 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses resulting primarily from the prior year recognition of MISO exit fees; lower transmission costs, prior year station outages, and 2011 regulatory asset amortization expenses; 

· An $88 million decrease primarily from the 2011 impairment of excess emission allowances as a result of the EPA’s issuance of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR); 

· An $85 million decrease in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets driven by lower natural gas costs, partially offset by increased volumes; 

· A $19 million decrease in fuel used due primarily to the termination of certain non-core operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and from lower natural gas prices; 

· A $15 million decrease due to the receipt of funds in 2012 related to a previously written-off receivable associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy; 

· A $15 million decrease in purchased power to serve Duke Energy Retail customers; and 

· A $13 million decrease in fuel used for the coal-fired generation assets driven primarily by lower generation volumes. 

Partially offset by: 

· A $54 million increase in purchased power to serve competitive retail load auctions. 

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance is primarily due to the sale of certain Duke Energy Generation Services, Inc. (DEGS) operations and higher equity earnings from the renewables portfolio. 

Interest Expense. The variance is primarily due to higher capitalized interest on wind construction projects. 

Income Tax Benefit. The variance in tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were (9.5) percent and (1.4) percent, respectively.  

Matters Impacting Future Commercial Power Results  

On February 17, 2014, Commercial Power announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Commercial Power expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Commercial Power will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell. 

In 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Commercial Power is responsible for certain MVP costs, a type of Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Commercial Power’s withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Commercial Power intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Commercial Power ultimately is found to be responsible for these costs, a portion of these costs may not be eligible for recovery, resulting in an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information. 

Changes or variability in assumptions used in calculating fair value of the renewables reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes including but not limited to, legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rates and discount rates, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit, goodwill and other asset impairment charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets associated with proposed renewable projects within Commercial Power’s renewables reporting unit was approximately $84 million at December 31, 2013. In addition, management periodically reviews individual projects within Commercial Power’s renewables portfolio to evaluate ongoing alignment with the strategic direction of the business. A determination that a project is no longer consistent with the business strategy and a decision to divest of a project or projects could result in an impairment charge.

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012  

Other’s results were positively impacted by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, the sale of DukeNet, and increased current year activity from mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger. These impacts were partially offset by increased interest expense, lower income tax benefit and the Crescent Resources LLC (Crescent) litigation reserve in 2013. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.  

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by increased activity from mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger and higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy.  

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, and prior year donations, partially offset by the Crescent litigation reserve in 2013 and unfavorable loss experience at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy. 

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of Duke Energy’s 50 percent ownership in DukeNet in 2013. 

Interest Expense. The variance was due primarily to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013 and additional debt issuances. 

Income Tax Benefit. The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 55.1 percent and 41.1 percent, respectively. 

Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011  

Other’s results were negatively impacted by charges related to the Progress Energy merger and higher interest expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher income tax benefit due to increased net expense and higher returns on investments that support benefit obligations. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy and mark-to-market activity at Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC (DETM). 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by charges related to the Progress Energy merger and higher current year donations. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower JV costs related to DETM. 

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance was driven primarily by current year impairments and prior year gains on sales of investments, higher interest income recorded in 2011 following the resolution of certain income tax matters related to prior years and reversal of reserves related to certain guarantees Duke Energy had issued on behalf of Crescent in 2011. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher returns on investments that support benefit obligations. 

Interest Expense. The variance was due primarily to higher debt balances as a result of debt issuances and the inclusion of Progress Energy interest expense beginning in July 2012. 

Income Tax Benefit. The variance is primarily due to an increase in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 41.1 percent and 56.0 percent, respectively. 

Matters Impacting Future Other Results  

Duke Energy previously held an effective 50 percent interest in Crescent. Crescent was a real estate joint venture formed by Duke Energy in 2006 that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. On June 9, 2010, Crescent restructured and emerged from bankruptcy and Duke Energy forfeited its entire 50 percent ownership interest to Crescent debt holders. This forfeiture caused Duke Energy to recognize a loss, for tax purposes, on its interest in the second quarter of 2010. Although Crescent has reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy with creditors owning all Crescent interest, there remains uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the restructuring. Based on this uncertainty, it is possible that Duke Energy could incur a future tax liability related to the tax losses associated with its partnership interest in Crescent and the resolution of issues associated with Crescent’s emergence from bankruptcy.

Introduction  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. 

Basis of Presentation  

The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Carolinas is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 

Results of Operations  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012  

Operating Revenues. The variance was primarily due to:  

· A $104 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by higher natural gas prices and increased sales volumes. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;  

· A $98 million increase in retail rates in North Carolina and South Carolina; 

· A $44 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers primarily due to higher demand; and 

· A $32 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to a new customer in 2013, increased capacity charges, and additional volumes for customers served under long-term contracts. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was primarily due to:  

· A $111 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower costs associated with the Progress Energy merger, decreased corporate costs, lower outage and non-outage costs at generation plants and the levelization of nuclear outage costs, partially offset by the establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter of 2012, pursuant to regulatory orders for future recovery of certain employee severance costs related to the 2010 voluntary severance plan and other costs; and  

· A $31 million decrease in impairment charges related to the merger with Progress Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission project costs for which recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC. 

Partially offset by:  

· A $118 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily related to higher sales volumes and increased prices of natural gas used in electric generation, net of change in fuel mix, partially offset by decreased purchased power due to additional generating capacity placed in service late 2012. 

Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The variance is due to recognition of gains on the sale of emissions allowances in 2012. 

Other Income and Expense, net. The variance is primarily due to lower earnings from AFUDC equity, resulting from major projects placed into service in late 2012, partially offset by higher deferred returns on completed projects prior to their inclusion in customer rates. 

45  

PART II  

Interest Expense. The variance is primarily due to deferrals of debt costs on completed projects prior to their inclusion in customer rates in September 2013, partially offset by lower AFUDC debt due primarily to certain major projects that were placed into service in late 2012. 

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax book income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 34.3 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC equity. 

Matters Impacting Future Duke Energy Carolinas Results 

Appeals of recently approved rate cases are pending at the North Carolina Supreme Court. The NCAG and NC WARN dispute the rate of return, capital structure and other matters approved by the NCUC. The outcome of these appeals could have an adverse impact to Duke Energy Carolinas’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012  

Operating Revenues. The variance was primarily due to:  

· A $167 million increase in base revenues at Duke Energy Florida as allowed by the 2012 Settlement; 

· A $136 million increase in wholesale sales at Duke Energy Progress (excluding fuel revenues) primarily due to a new customer contract that began in January 2013, an amended capacity contract that began in May 2012 and favorable weather conditions; 

· A $117 million increase at Duke Energy Progress due to revised rates in North Carolina; 

· A $57 million increase in nuclear cost-recovery clause revenues at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to an increase in recovery rates related to the Crystal River Unit 3 uprate project, prior period true-ups, and Levy as allowed by the 2012 Settlement; and 

· A $24 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in GWh sales to retail customers at Duke Energy Progress due to higher weather normal sales volumes to retail customers. 

Partially offset by:  

· A $387 million decrease in retail fuel revenues at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to the impact of lower residential fuel rates and a decrease in GWh retail sales due to weather and lower usage. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was primarily due to:  

· A $482 million decrease in retail fuel expense at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds including amortization associated with the 2012 Settlement, lower system requirements, and the prior year establishment of a regulatory liability for replacement power in accordance with the 2012 Settlement;  

· A $136 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses at Duke Energy Progress primarily due to lower costs associated with the merger with Duke Energy and the levelization of nuclear outage costs;  

· A $71 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to the deferral of Crystal River Unit 3-related expenses, in accordance with the 2012 Settlement, lower costs associated with the merger with Duke Energy, and the prior year write-off of previously deferred costs related to the vendor not selected costs for the Crystal River Unit 3 containment repair. These were partially offset by the prior year reversal of accruals in conjunction with the placement of Crystal River Unit 3 into extended cold shutdown in accordance with the 2012 Settlement and higher charges associated with related settlement matters; and 

· A $32 million decrease in impairment charges at Duke Energy Progress related to the merger with Duke Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission project costs for which recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC, partially offset by a current year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at Harris. 

Partially offset by:

PART II  

· A $212 million increase in impairment and other charges at Duke Energy Florida. In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded charges primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy. In 2012, Duke Energy Florida recorded impairment and other charges related to the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information; and 

· A $138 million increase in depreciation and amortization at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to higher nuclear cost-recovery amortization related to Levy and a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement. 

Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to lower AFUDC equity resulting from to major projects placed in service in late 2012 and the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to the deferral of debt costs recorded on the retail portion of the retired Crystal River Unit 3 assets, partially offset by the charge to interest expense on the redemption of Progress Energy’s 7.10% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS) in January 2013.  

Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations. The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 36.2 percent and 32.7 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC equity and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) dividend deduction being recorded at Duke Energy in 2012. 

Discontinued Operations, net of tax. The variance was primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Global, LLC (Global) settlement in 2012. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information.

The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 42.2 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and a decrease in the manufacturing deduction in 2013. 

Matters Impacting Future Duke Energy Ohio Results 

On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell. 

In 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Duke Energy Ohio is responsible for certain MVP costs, a type of MTEP cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Duke Energy Ohio’s withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Duke Energy Ohio ultimately is found to be responsible for these costs, a portion of these costs may not be eligible for recovery, resulting in an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.

Basis of Presentation  

The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Indiana is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 

Results of Operations  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012  

Operating Revenues. The variance was primarily driven by:  

· A $155 million net increase primarily related to updates to the IGCC rider, and 

· A $43 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) due to an increase in fuel rates as a result of higher fuel and purchased power costs. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was primarily driven by:  

· A $600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, and 

· A $40 million decrease in depreciation expense due to a regulatory order related to the Edwardsport IGCC settlement agreement. 

Partially offset by: 

· A $43 million increase in fuel costs primarily driven by higher fuel and purchased power costs.  

Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily driven by a $70 million decrease in AFUDC equity primarily due to updates to the IGCC rider in January 2013. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily driven by a $30 million decrease in AFUDC debt primarily due to updates to the IGCC rider in January 2013. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit). The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 38.4 percent and 59.5 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax was primarily due to pretax income in 2013 compared to pretax loss in 2012 primarily resulting from the Edwardsport IGCC project impairment and the impact of AFUDC equity in 2013 that reduced the tax expense compared to higher AFUDC in 2012 that increased the tax benefit.

PART II  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs.  

Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the Duke Energy board of directors. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. 

Regulatory Accounting   

A substantial majority of Regulated Utilities, Duke Energy’s regulated operations, meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy records assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds, or reduce rates, to customers for previous collections or for costs that have yet to be incurred.  

Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy’s jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. Total regulatory assets for Duke Energy were $10,086 million and $11,741 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total regulatory liabilities were $6,265 million and $5,740 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”  

As required by regulated operations accounting, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable cost is considered to be an entity specific cost recoverable in future rates and therefore a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.  

Regulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. Other disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery. As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” during 2012 and 2011 Duke Energy Indiana recorded charges of $631 million and $222 million, respectively, related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded a charge of $295 million related to the retired Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Station. Also as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Sales of Other Assets”, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded disallowance charges in 2012 in order to gain FERC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress guaranteed total fuel savings to customers in North Carolina and South Carolina of $687 million over the five years in order to gain NCUC and SCPSC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Based on current estimates of future fuel costs, Duke Energy anticipates that it will meet the guaranteed fuel savings. However, if actual fuel costs are higher than expected, Duke Energy could record a charge for the unmet guaranteed savings. 

Goodwill Impairment Assessments   

Duke Energy’s goodwill balances by segment are included in the following table.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2012, Duke Energy recorded $12,469 million of goodwill associated with the merger with Progress Energy. This goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, and was allocated entirely to the Regulated Utilities segment. The remainder of Regulated Utilities’ goodwill relates to the acquisition of Cinergy in April 2006.  

Duke Energy allocates goodwill to reporting units, which are a subset of the business segments and are determined based on how the segment is managed. Duke Energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Duke Energy performs its annual impairment test as of August 31.  

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate  

56  

PART II  

regulation, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for Duke Energy’s business and the fair value of debt. 

Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on Duke Energy’s internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for Duke Energy’s views of market participant assumptions. Duke Energy’s internal business plan reflects management’s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third-party sources, projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. The business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service, the renewal of certain contracts and the future of renewable tax credits. Management also makes assumptions regarding operation, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense forecasts.  

One of the most significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on twenty-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2013 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. For example, Duke Energy Ohio’s transmission and distribution reporting unit generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as it does not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor does it have significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon legislation or pending EPA regulations. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2013, for each of Duke Energy’s domestic reporting units ranged from 5.4 percent to 7.4 percent.  

For Duke Energy’s international operations, a country specific risk adder based on the average risk premium for each separate country in which International Energy operates was added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profiles. This resulted in a discount rate for the August 31, 2013 goodwill impairment test for the international operations of 10.6 percent. 

The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.  

The majority of Duke Energy’s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy’s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, changes in discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of equity.  

As of August 31, 2013, all of the reporting units’ estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by more than 10 percent. 

The fair value of Commercial Power’s Renewables reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of factors, including legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and discount rates. As of December 31, 2013, the Renewables reporting unit’s estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity. Duke Energy continues to monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value, and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate. 

Long-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments   

Property, plant and equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections, the determination that it is more likely than not an asset or asset group will be sold, or a regulating body with authority to set rates Duke Energy charges to customers approves an order disallowing recovery of costs incurred or to be incurred) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value, except when applied to regulated plant costs that are disallowed for ratemaking purposes. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows. See “Regulatory Accounting” for information related to accounting for rate regulated operations.  

Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the asset and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value of the asset requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.  

When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows. For regulated entities, the lowest level with discrete cash flows is generally the operating utility level. 

When it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon  

57  

PART II  

amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable.  

As discussed further in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions, Dispositions, and Sales of Other Assets,” in the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. As a result, Duke Energy expects to classify the Midwest generation business as held for sale and record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2014. As discussed further in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions, Dispositions, and Sales of Other Assets,” in the third quarter of 2012, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded certain impairment charges in conjunction with the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. As discussed further in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” in the third quarter of 2011, Commercial Power recorded $79 million of pretax impairment charges related to CAA emission allowances that were no longer expected to be used as a result of the issuance of the final CSAPR. These impairment charges are recorded in Goodwill and Other Impairment Charges on Duke Energy’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

Accounting for Loss Contingencies   

Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures require judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events. Duke Energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as federal, state and local courts and other regulators. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved, which could have a material impact on future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy.  

For further information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies.”  

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits   

The calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Additionally, medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to Duke Energy’s estimates of other post-retirement benefits.  

Duke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. Prior service cost or credit, which represents the effect on plan liabilities due to plan amendments, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. 

Duke Energy maintains non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and years of service and current interest credits. Certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula.  

Duke Energy provides some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans.  

For both pension and other post-retirement plans, Duke Energy assumes its plan’s assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent as of December 31, 2013. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. U.S. equities are held for their high expected return. Non-U.S. equities, debt securities, hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments. In September 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for its pension plan assets. As the funded status of the Duke Energy and Progress Energy pension plans increase, over time the allocation to return-seeking assets will be reduced and the allocation to fixed-income assets will be increased to better manage Duke Energy’s pension liability and reduce funded status volatility. Based on the current funded status of the plans, the asset allocation for the Duke Energy pension plans has been adjusted to 60 percent fixed-income assets and 40 percent return-seeking assets and the asset allocation for the Progress Energy pension plans has been adjusted to 55 percent fixed-income assets and 45 percent return-seeking assets. 

The assets for Duke Energy’s pension and other post-retirement plans are maintained in a master trust. Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the Duke Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust (VEBA I). The investment objective of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants. VEBA I is passively managed.  

Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 4.7 percent as of December 31, 2013. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2013, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to match the timing of projected benefit payments. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.  

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy’s pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will

be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy’s 2013 pretax pension expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25 percent change in rates were to occur. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Duke Energy’s U.S. post-retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in medical health care costs. Duke Energy’s U.S. post-retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug health care costs. As of December 31, 2013, the medical care trend rates were 8.5 percent, which grades to 5.00 percent by 2021. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy’s 2013 pretax other post-retirement expense and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 1 percentage point change in the health care trend rate were to occur.

PART II  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Sources and Uses of Cash  

Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy’s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Duke Energy’s projected primary sources and uses for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement. 

Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. Duke Energy’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its business. 

Credit Facilities and Registration Statements 

Master Credit Facility Summary 

Duke Energy has a master credit facility with a capacity of $6 billion through December 2018. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy each have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the master credit facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the master credit facility. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

PremierNotes 

Duke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, was $836 million and $395 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

PART II  

Shelf Registration 

In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy.  

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

Duke Energy’s projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

DEBT MATURITIES 

The following table shows the significant components of Current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Duke Energy Registrants currently anticipate satisfying these obligations, primarily with cash on hand and proceeds from additional borrowings. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS 

Duke Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for 88 consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.  

Over the past several years, Duke Energy’s dividend has grown at approximately two percent annually, slower than overall earnings growth. The Board of Directors continues to target a payout ratio of 65 percent to 70 percent, based upon adjusted diluted EPS. Once the dividend is within the target payout ratio, Duke Energy believes it has the flexibility to grow the dividend at a pace more consistent with earnings growth.  

Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries 

As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements “Regulatory Matters”, Duke Energy’s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy via dividend, advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2013, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend is less than 25 percent of Duke Energy’s consolidated net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on Duke Energy’s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations. 

61  

PART II  

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 

The relatively stable operating cash flows of Regulated Utilities compose a substantial portion of Duke Energy’s cash flows from operations. Regulated Utilities’ cash flows from operations are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas and costs of operations. Weather conditions, commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses, including unplanned plant outages and storms can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations. Duke Energy provides the liquidity support for Commercial Power’s coal-fired and gas-fired assets that are dispatched into the PJM wholesale market. Commercial Power has economically hedged a portion of its forecasted generation through 2018 with various counterparties, and a substantial portion of these contracts require daily posting of margin, which can be significant. Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the master credit facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information).  

At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion, of which $1.1 billion is held by entities domiciled in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in International Energy. Undistributed foreign earnings associated with International Energy’s operations are considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result, no U.S. tax is recorded on such earnings. This assertion is based on management’s determination that the cash held in International Energy’s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its U.S. operations and that International Energy either has invested or has intentions to reinvest such earnings. While management currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all of International Energy’s unremitted earnings, should circumstances change, Duke Energy may need to record additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination changes. The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2013, on which Duke Energy has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes is approximately $2.4 billion. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at between $300 million and $375 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. 

DEBT ISSUANCES 

Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.  

Duke Energy’s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. The 2014 projected capitalization percentages exclude purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Duke Energy’s fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using SEC guidelines, was 3.0 times for 2013, 2.5 times for 2012, and 3.2 times for 2011. 

Restrictive Debt Covenants 

Duke Energy’s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. The master credit facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 percent for each borrower. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2013, Duke Energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses. 

Credit Ratings 

Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries each hold credit ratings by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (S&P). Duke Energy’s corporate credit rating and issuer credit rating from Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, respectively, as of February 13, 2013 is BBB+, A3 and BBB+, respectively. As of February 13, 2014, the Duke Energy Registrants’ have stable outlooks from Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. 

The following table includes the Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries’ Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings as of February 13, 2014. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Credit ratings are dependent on the ability to meet our debt principal and interest obligations when they come due, which is a measure of the strength of the current balance sheet. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, Duke Energy and certain other subsidiaries are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.  

Most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007 spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp (Spectra Energy), having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.  

Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. 

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and Indemnifications,” for further details of the guarantee arrangements.  

Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy’s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information on these commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies.”  

Contractual Obligations   

Duke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energy’s contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2013. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PART II  

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Risk Management Policies  

Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures, and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.  

The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please review Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein. 

Commodity Price Risk  

Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. Duke Energy’s exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation of its operations in its Regulated Utilities segment as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations.  

Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy’s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Derivatives and Hedging.”  

Validation of a contract’s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from Duke Energy’s deal origination function. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition.  

HEDGING STRATEGIES 

Duke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. These instruments are also used to optimize the value of the nonregulated generation portfolio. Duke Energy’s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel.  

The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy’s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.  

Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract’s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.  

GENERATION PORTFOLIO RISKS  

Duke Energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, natural gas, and coal prices in the Regulated Utilities and Commercial Power segments. The Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their wholesale and nonregulated generation portfolios. The portfolios include generation assets, fuel, and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units. For the Regulated Utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers. The Commercial Power nonregulated generation portfolio dispatches all of its electricity into unregulated markets on a day-ahead and real-time basis and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from PJM. Commercial Power has economically hedged its forecasted coal-fired generation and a significant portion of its forecasted gas-fired generation for 2014. Commercial Power also has long-term economic hedges in place for a portion of expected coal and gas generation through 2017 and 2018, respectively. Capacity revenues are 100 percent fixed in PJM through May 2017. International Energy generally hedges its expected generation using long-term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions exist and it is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts. International Energy dispatches electricity not sold under long-term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from national system operators. Derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond 2014 are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, fuel oil and coal. See “Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio and Derivative Price Risks” below, for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity prices on Duke Energy’s net income.  

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR GENERATION PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE PRICE RISKS 

68  

PART II  

The table below summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on Duke Energy’s pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed for the nonregulated generation portfolio. Forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for the Regulated Utilities segment is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy’s results of operations in 2014. The following commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels, as indicated in the table below, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest Rate Risk   

Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 14, and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” “Debt and Credit Facilities,” “Derivatives and Hedging,” and “Fair Value Measurements.”  

The paragraph below summarizes the potential effect of interest rate changes on the Duke Energy Registrants’ pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. 

At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had no notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and no pre-issuance hedges outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on $5,677 million of long-term and short-term variable interest rate exposure that has not been hedged at December 31, 2013 was 1.45 percent. 

These amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short-term and long-term investments, cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The change in interest rate sensitivity for Duke Energy is primarily due to changes in short-term debt balances and cash balances. If interest rates changed significantly, Duke Energy would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in Duke Energy’s financial structure.  

Marketable Securities Price Risk   

As described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.  

PENSION PLAN ASSETS 

Duke Energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. 

A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy’s results of operations in those periods.  

NDTF 

As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2013, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, fixed-income securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code,NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail rates; therefore, fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their Consolidated Statements of Operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or

regulatory liabilities pursuant to an Order by the NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations” for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” for additional information regarding NDTF assets.  

Foreign Currency Risk   

Duke Energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity-related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S. Dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency. Duke Energy may also use foreign currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations. To monitor its currency exchange rate risks, Duke Energy uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure.  

Duke Energy’s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real. The table below summarizes the potential effect of foreign currency devaluations on Duke Energy’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

OTHER ISSUES  

Fixed Charges Coverage Ratios  

The Duke Energy Registrants’ fixed charges coverage ratios, as calculated using SEC guidelines, are included in the table below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Dan River Ash Basin Release  

On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas’ retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river. 

Duke Energy cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with remediation of this release at this time. Other costs related to the Dan River release and other ash basins, including regulatory directives, natural resources damages, future lawsuits, future claims, long-term environmental impact costs, long-term operational changes, and costs associated with new laws and regulations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  

Global Climate Change  

The Duke Energy Registrants’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions consist primarily of CO2 with most coming from their fleet of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. In 2013, the Duke Energy Registrants’ U.S. power plants emitted approximately 134 million tons of CO2. CO2 emissions from Duke Energy’s international operations were approximately 3 million tons. The Duke Energy Registrants’ future CO2 emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, and the Duke Energy Registrants’ decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs. 

The Duke Energy Registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which they currently operate fossil-fueled electric generating units to implement requirements to reduce CO2 emissions absent a federal requirement to mandate reductions in GHG emissions. On June 25, 2013, the President of the United States issued a memorandum directing the EPA to propose CO2 emissions requirements for existing fossil-fuel  

70  

PART II  

electric generating units by June 1, 2014, and to finalize the guidelines for states to develop their own regulations for implementing the guidelines by June 1, 2015. The memorandum directed the EPA to require state to submit their implementation regulations for approval by June 30, 2016. 

The Duke Energy Registrants are taking actions that will result in reduced GHG emissions over time. These actions will lower the Duke Energy Registrants’ exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether a result of federal legislation or EPA regulation. Under any future scenario involving mandatory GHG limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of compliance costs associated with their regulated operations through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. 

The Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change, and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place, and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants’ impossible. Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events they experience from time to time, such as ice storms, tornados, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and droughts. 

The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems. The Duke Energy Registrants’ electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity. The Duke Energy Registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on their operations. 

Other EPA Regulations Recently Published and Under Development   

The EPA has issued and is in various stages of developing several non-greenhouse gas (non-GHG) environmental regulations that will affect the Duke Energy Registrants. These include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for hazardous air pollutants, which is effective beginning in 2015, as well as proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures under the Clean Water Act 316(b), coal combustion residuals, and steam effluent limitation guidelines. As a group, these non-GHG environmental regulations will require the Duke Energy Registrants to install additional environmental controls and accelerate retirement of some coal-fired units. While the ultimate regulatory requirements for the Duke Energy Registrants from the group of EPA regulatory actions will not be known until all the rules have been finalized, for planning purposes, the Duke Energy Registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that may need to be installed to comply with this group of rules could total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, over the next 10 years. This range includes estimated costs for new control equipment necessary to comply with the MATS of $525 million to $625 million. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other expenses in conjunction with the non-GHG regulations. The Duke Energy Registrants are planning to retire coal-fired generating capacity that is not economic to bring into compliance with the EPA’s regulations. Beyond 2013, total planned and potential retirements could exceed 2,400 MW of coal-fired generating capacity. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur costs for replacement generation as a result of the potential coal-fired power plant retirements. Until the final regulatory requirements of the group of EPA regulations are known and can be fully evaluated, the potential compliance costs associated with these EPA regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty. Therefore, the actual compliance costs incurred and MW to be retired may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final EPA regulations.

Nuclear Matters  

Following the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan, Duke Energy conducted thorough inspections at each of its seven nuclear sites during 2011. The initial inspections did not identify any significant vulnerabilities, however, Duke Energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to external events. Emergency-response capabilities, written procedures and engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each site’s ability to respond in the unlikely event of station blackout. Duke Energy is working within the nuclear industry to improve safety standards and margin using the three layers of safety approach used in the U.S.: protection, mitigation and emergency response. Emergency equipment is currently being added at each station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources are lost permanently. These improvements are in addition to the numerous layers of safety measures and systems previously in place. 

In March 2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. On July 13, 2011, the task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection, enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of NRC programs. The recommendations were further prioritized into three tiers based on the safety enhancement level. On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation. 

On August 30, 2012, the NRC issued implementation guidance to enable power plants to achieve compliance with the orders issued in March 2012. Plants were required to submit implementation plans to the NRC by February 28, 2013, and complete implementation of the safety enhancements within two refueling outages or by December 31, 2016, whichever comes first. Each plant is also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present-day methods and information, conduct inspections to ensure protection against hazards in the current design basis, and re-evaluate emergency communications systems and staffing levels. 

Duke Energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the NRC in connection with the March 12, 2012, regulatory orders noted above, the cost of which could be material. Until such time as the NRC-mandated reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and cost of compliance modifications to Duke Energy’s sites will not be known. With the NRC’s continuing review of the remaining recommendations, Duke Energy cannot predict to what extent the NRC will impose additional licensing and safety-related requirements, or the costs of complying with such requirements. Upon receipt of additional guidance from the NRC and a collaborative
