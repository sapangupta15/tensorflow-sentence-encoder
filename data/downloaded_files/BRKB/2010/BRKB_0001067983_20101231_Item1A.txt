Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as we, us, our or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in our business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.  

Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.  

We have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. We could incur a significant loss from a single event and do so willingly if properly paid for the risk assumed. We have also written some coverages for losses arising from acts of terrorism. In all cases, however, we attempt to avoid writing groups of policies from which losses might seriously aggregate. However, it is possible that despite our efforts, losses may aggregate in ways that were not anticipated. The tolerance for huge losses may result in such losses in future periods, which may result in lower reported earnings.  

The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses.  

In the insurance business, premiums are charged today for promises to pay covered losses in the future. The principal cost associated with premium revenue is claims. However, it will take decades before all losses that have occurred as of the balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that loss reserve balances are adequate to cover losses, we will not truly know whether the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Except for certain product lines, our objective is to generate underwriting profits over the long-term. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated insurance loss reserves are large ($60 billion at December 31, 2010) so increases to reserve estimates can result in materially lower periodic reported earnings.  

Insurance subsidiaries investments are unusually concentrated and fair values are subject to loss in value.  

Compared to other insurers, our insurance subsidiaries invest an unusually high percentage of their assets in common stocks and diversify their portfolios far less than is conventional. A significant decline in the general stock market or in the price of major investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders equity and under certain circumstances may require the recognition of losses in the statement of earnings. Decreases in values of equity investments can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share.  

Derivative contracts may require significant future cash settlement payments and result in significant losses.  

We have assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Although we received considerable premiums as compensation for accepting these risks, there is no assurance that the premiums we received will exceed our aggregate cash settlement payments. While the risks under the credit default contracts are limited to specified entities, amounts per entity and aggregate contract limits, the deterioration of the U.S. economy or in the financial condition of the referenced entities, could result in significant losses. Although no loss events occurred in 2010 and our remaining exposures decreased, the risks of additional payments and losses in our earnings from credit defaults continues into the future. Our risks of losses under equity index put option contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major stock indexes worldwide. Although the contracts currently in-force do not begin to expire until 2018, we could be subject to significant future settlement payments at expiration if equity index prices are below the strike prices specified in the contracts.  

The credit default and equity index put option contracts are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the periodic changes in fair value are reported in earnings. The valuations of these contracts and the impact on our earnings can be particularly significant reflecting the volatility of credit and equity markets and material losses may be reported in future periodic earnings.  

We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.  

Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, age 80, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 87. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a

 material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshires Board of Directors has identified four current Berkshire subsidiary managers who are capable of being CEO. Berkshires Board has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Boards succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk.  

The past growth rate in Berkshires book value per share is not an indication of future results.  

In the years since our present management acquired control of Berkshire, our book value per share has grown at a highly satisfactory rate. Because of the large size of our capital base (shareholders equity of approximately $157.3 billion as of December 31, 2010), our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at a rate even close to its past rate.  

Competition  

Each of our operating businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. Competition may arise domestically as well as internationally. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline from current levels.  

Unfavorable economic and political conditions could hurt our operating businesses.  

Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the industries in which we operate. To the extent that the recovery from the recent economic recession in the U.S. and worldwide is slow or the economy worsens for a prolonged period of time, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses, our railroad business and our manufactured housing finance operations regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures. These businesses depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the credit is restricted or the cost of funding increases, our operations could be adversely affected.  

Historically, we derived a relatively small amount of our revenues and earnings from international markets. Our international business was conducted primarily in regions where relatively stable political and economic conditions have prevailed. As a result of our business acquisitions, we are subject to increased risks from unstable political conditions and civil unrest at certain of our internationally based businesses. Further, terrorism activities deriving from unstable conditions could produce significant insurance and other operating losses to our worldwide operations, including operations based in the United States. Our business operations could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resources and destruction of production facilities.  

Risks unique to our regulated businesses  

Insurance Businesses  

Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business we can write, the rates we can charge for coverage, the level of capital that we must maintain, and restrictions on the types and size of investments we can make. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance companies, may adversely impact our results of operations.  

Railroad Business  

Our railroad business is subject to a significant amount of governmental laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSFs business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Increased economic regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSFs ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Utilities and Energy Businesses  

For the most part, our utilities and energy businesses, which generate, transmit and distribute electricity and transport, store and distribute natural gas, are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions in which they operate. These regulations are complex, dynamic and may be subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses, have broad application and limit our ability to independently make and implement management decisions regarding numerous matters, including business combinations; constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; operation of generating facilities and transmission and distribution assets; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; transactions between our domestic utilities and other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends to shareholders. Adverse new legislation, regulation, reinterpretations of existing regulation, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproducts, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.  

Our utilities and energy business requires significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain sufficient generation, transmission and distribution systems. Usually, large amounts of borrowed funds are required to capitalize these businesses and additional borrowed funds may not be available at economically favorable terms. Additionally, such systems may need to be operational for very long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers.  

Our Class B common stock is not convertible and has a lower vote and stock price than our Class A common stock.  

Each share of Class A common stock is currently convertible into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock, but shares of Class B common stock are not convertible into shares of Class A common stock or any other security. Although a share of Class B common stock may sell below one-fifteen-hundredth of the market price for a share of Class A common stock, it is unlikely that a share of Class B common stock will sell significantly above 1/1,500 of the market price for a share of Class A common stock because higher prices than that would cause arbitrage activity to ensue. Also, holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote, but holders of Class B common stock are currently entitled to only 1/10,000 of a vote for each Class B share on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.  

Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.  

Over the past year, partially in response to the financial markets crises and the global economic recession, regulatory initiatives have accelerated in the United States and abroad. Such initiatives address for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, regulations related to environmental and global-warming matters and health care reform. It is not yet clear whether or not these initiatives will result in significant changes to existing laws and regulations. These initiatives could have a significant impact on our operating businesses as well as on the businesses that we have a significant but not controlling economic interest. Accordingly we cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
