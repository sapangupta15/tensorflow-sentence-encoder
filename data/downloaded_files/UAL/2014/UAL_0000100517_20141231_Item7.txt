ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview  

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, UAL or the Company) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, United). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. Uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UALs revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UALs assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the Company in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.  

2014 Financial Highlights  

       2014 net income was $1.1 billion, or $2.93 diluted earnings per share. The Company recorded Non-GAAP net income of $1.97 billion for 2014, or $5.06 diluted earnings per share, which excludes $507 million of operating and nonoperating special charges and $327 million of Economic Hedge Adjustments, consisting of $244 million of mark-to-market losses recorded in Nonoperating expense from fuel hedges settling in future periods and $83 million of prior period gains recorded in Nonoperating expense on fuel contracts settled in the current period. See Part II, Item 6 of this report for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP net income.  

       Uniteds consolidated PRASM increased 1.6% for 2014 compared to 2013.  

       2014 consolidated CASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, increased 1.3% year-over-year on a consolidated capacity increase of 0.3%. 2014 CASM, including those items, decreased 1.6% year-over-year.  

       In 2014, UAL returned approximately $320 million to shareholders as part of its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In addition, throughout the year, United spent $310 million to retire convertible debt that was convertible into approximately 5.8 million shares of UAL common stock.  

       UAL ended the year with $5.7 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which consisted of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available capacity under the revolving credit facility of the Companys Credit Agreement.  

2014 Operational Highlights  

       Consolidated RPMs for 2014 increased 0.2% as compared to 2013, and consolidated ASMs increased 0.3% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 83.6% in 2014, which is the same load factor as in 2013.  

       The Company took delivery of four new Boeing 787-8 and two new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2014, bringing its total Dreamliner fleet to 14 aircraft. The Company also took delivery of 29 new Boeing 737-900ERs and 19 new Embraer E175s in 2014. United exited from scheduled service 37 Boeing 757-200s.  

2015 Outlook  

Set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. See Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report and the factors described under Forward-Looking Information below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.

The Company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2015. Key initiatives for the year include improving our operational reliability and the handling of customers during irregular operations, such as adverse weather, improving our customer experience by adding satellite-based Wi-Fi to nearly all our mainline aircraft, introducing a new united.com website, refurbishing aircraft interiors, investing in our airports and taking delivery of more than 40 new, highly-efficient and customer-pleasing aircraft, and improving our financial performance.  

Economic Conditions. The economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2015 is characterized by expected slow or modest U.S. and global economic growth. In such conditions, we expect a modest increase in the demand for air travel. Continuing economic uncertainty, along with the strengthening U.S. dollar, is providing uncertainty in key Asian and European markets, and along with continued political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the Middle East, may result in diminished demand for air travel. The global economy is also being impacted by declining oil prices, putting pressure on certain geographic markets.   

Capacity. Over the past three years, the Company leveraged the flexibility of its fleet to better match capacity with market demand. In 2015, the Company expects consolidated ASMs to grow between 1.5% and 2.5% year-over-year.   

Fuel. The Companys average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $2.99 in 2014 as compared to $3.13 in 2013. Recently, the price of jet fuel has declined, but remains volatile. Decreases in fuel prices for an extended period may result in increased industry capacity, increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general. If fuel prices were subsequently to rise significantly, there may be a lag between improvement of revenue and the adverse impact of higher fuel prices. Given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, the Company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices, especially if these increases are rapid and sustained. Further, such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable, may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the Companys strategic growth and investment plans for the future. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2015, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Companys annual fuel expense by approximately $93 million. To protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel, the Company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements.  

Labor. As of December 31, 2014, United had approximately 80% of employees represented by unions. During 2014, Uniteds maintenance instructor, load planner, fleet technical instructor, security officer and dispatcher work groups ratified new joint labor agreements. We are in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with our technicians and flight attendants. The Company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups, although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have a material financial impact on the Company.  

CASM. In 2015, the Company expects CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense, profit sharing and special charges to be flat to up one percent year-over-year. We are unable to project CASM on a GAAP basis as the nature and amount of special charges are not determinable at this time.   

The Companys cost initiative project that began in 2014, called Project Quality, has a goal to reduce the Companys annual costs by $2 billion and generate an incremental $700 million in additional ancillary revenue by the end of 2017. The anticipated savings are comprised of $1 billion in annual fuel savings, based on fuel prices in 2013, and $1 billion of non-fuel savings. In 2014, the Company achieved approximately $200 million in fuel savings and $380 million in non-fuel savings.  

MileagePlus. Effective March 1, 2015, the Company will modify its MileagePlus program for most tickets from the current model in which members earn redeemable miles based on distance traveled to one based on ticket price (including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges). Members will be able to earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their MileagePlus status. The updated program will enhance the rewards for customers who spend more with United and give them improved mileage-earning opportunities.

Results of Operations  

In this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor the Companys performance on a consistent basis.  

2014 compared to 2013  

Operating Revenue  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in the Companys operating revenues for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents the Companys selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region (regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) See Part II, Item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.  

Consolidated passenger revenue in 2014 increased $640 million, or 1.9%, as compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 1.7% and an increase in average fare per passenger of 2.8%. There was also an increase in capacity and traffic of 0.3%and 0.2%, respectively, as compared to 2013. The 2014 average fare increase was due in part to a strong domestic demand environment and a number of new long-haul routes that generated higher fares than the system average. Also in 2014, the Company improved its revenue management demand forecast process related to close-in bookings which improved yields. 2013 consolidated passenger revenue was negatively impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in China and the Japanese yen weakening against the U.S. dollar, resulting in lower Pacific yields.

Table of Contents 

Cargo revenue increased by $56 million, or 6.3%, in 2014 as compared to 2013, which was primarily due to higher freight volumes and an improvement in mail revenue year-over-year, partially offset by lower yield on freight.  

Other operating revenue decreased $74 million, or 1.7%, in 2014 as compared to 2013, which was primarily due to the Companys decision to discontinue sales of aircraft fuel to a third party, partially offset by increases in ancillary, MileagePlus and contract services revenue.  

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to the Companys operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 0.3% increase in capacity.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Includes ineffectiveness gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges and gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges that were not designated for hedge accounting. Ineffectiveness gains (losses) and gains (losses) on hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net.  

(b) Includes $81 million for hedges settled in the fourth quarter of 2014 prior to their original 2015 maturity dates.  

Salaries and related costs increased $310 million, or 3.6%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher pay rates driven by collective bargaining agreements, increased medical and dental costs and costs associated with crew shortages and new crew rest rules, partially offset by lower post-employment benefit costs.  

36  

Table of Contents 

Landing fees and other rent increased $184 million, or 8.8%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly. Landing fees have also increased due to airport security services and modernization projects at certain airport locations.  

Aircraft rent decreased $53 million, or 5.7%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to aircraft lease expirations and terminations of several Boeing 757-200 aircraft leases resulting from the Companys purchase of the leased aircraft.  

The table below presents integration-related costs and special items incurred by the Company during the years ended December 31 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See Note 17 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Companys nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $48 million, or 6.1%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the Companys extinguishment of certain of its debt instruments and the refinancing of certain of its debt instruments at lower interest rates.  

In 2014, Miscellaneous, net included a MTM loss of $465 million from fuel hedge derivatives as compared to a gain of $84 million in 2013. Miscellaneous, net also included foreign currency losses of $41 million and $29 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 2014 Miscellaneous, net includes a $64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the $248 million 6% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures.  

Uniteds nonoperating expense also included a net gain of $19 million associated with marking to market the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities related to agreements that provide for Uniteds convertible debt to be settled with UAL common stock as compared to a net gain of $70 million in 2013. These net gains and related derivatives are reflected only in the United stand-alone financial statements as they are eliminated at the consolidated level. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Operating Revenue  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in the Companys operating revenues for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents the Companys selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region (regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a) See Part II, Item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.  

Consolidated passenger revenue in 2013 increased $539 million, or 1.7%, as compared to 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 1.8% and an increase in average fare per passenger of 2.6%, offset in part by a decline in capacity of 1.4% and a reduction in traffic of 0.2% as compared to the year-ago period. Consolidated passenger revenue was also impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in China and the Japanese yen weakening against the U.S. dollar, resulting in lower Pacific yields and a revenue management demand forecast which underestimated the amount of close-in booking demand resulting in a lower-than-expected yield mix in 2013.  

Cargo revenue decreased by $136 million, or 13.4%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to lower volumes on freight primarily in the Domestic and Atlantic regions offset slightly by an increase in mail revenue for the period. Both freight volume and yield continued to decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the continuation of declining demand for shipments of freight.  

Other operating revenue increased $724 million, or 20.4%, in 2013 as compared to 2012, which was primarily due to the sale of aircraft fuel of approximately $400 million to a third party. Other operating revenue also increased due to additional revenue from non-airline partners under our MileagePlus loyalty program, passenger ticket change fees and sales of airport lounge access.

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to the Companys operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The significant decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices, a 1.4% reduction in capacity and gains (losses) from fuel hedging activity in both years, as shown in the table below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Includes ineffectiveness gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges and gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges that were not designated for hedge accounting. These amounts are recorded in Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net.  

Salaries and related costs increased $680 million, or 8.6%, in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase was due to higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements, profit sharing and other incentive programs, as well as increased pension and retirement plan costs.  

Landing fees and other rent increased $161 million, or 8.3%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly. Landing fees paid directly to airports are charged to Landing fees and other rent while payments to regional carriers are recorded to Regional capacity purchase. As a result of this change, there was a significant shift of expense out of Regional capacity purchase into Landing fees and other rent in 2013. Other rent also increased as a result of the increase in rent at Newark Liberty pursuant to an amendment to Uniteds Terminal C lease signed in early 2013 that extended the term of the Terminal C lease with respect to concourses C-1 and C-2 at Newark Liberty until 2033.  

39  

Table of Contents 

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $61 million, or 3.5%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased volume and scope of airframe heavy checks, mainly on the Boeing 747 and Boeing 757 fleet types, partially offset by a reduction in engine maintenance volumes driven mainly by the timing of overhauls.  

Depreciation and amortization increased $167 million, or 11.0%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to additions in owned property and equipment in the current year, specifically related to new aircraft and improvements at airport facilities, as well as accelerated depreciation of $89 million on 30 Boeing 757-200 aircraft in process of being sold to a third party.  

Other operating expenses increased $514 million, or 11.0%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the cost of aircraft fuel sold to a third party and an increase in other personnel-related expenses.  

The table below presents integration-related costs and special items incurred by UAL during the years ended December 31 (in millions):

See Note 17 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $52 million, or 6.2%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower average debt principal outstanding for a majority of the year.  

In 2013, miscellaneous, net included a gain of $84 million from fuel hedge derivatives as compared to a gain of $37 million in 2012.  

Uniteds nonoperating expense also included a net gain of $70 million associated with marking to market the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities related to agreements that provide for Uniteds convertible debt to be settled with UAL common stock as compared to a net gain of $42 million in 2012. This net gain and related derivatives were reflected only in the United stand-alone financial statements as they were eliminated at the consolidated level. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $4.4 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of $0.7 billion from December 31, 2013. The Company had its entire commitment capacity of $1.35 billion under the Credit Agreement available for letters of credit or borrowings as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $320 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for performance bonds, letters of credit, credit card processing agreements and estimated future workers compensation claims. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations that are not currently backed by cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 totaled $395 million. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had cash collateralized $74 million of letters of credit. Approximately $100 million of the Companys unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars as of December 31, 2014 based on a mix of historical rates in effect at the time of submission for repatriation. United is working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency.  

As is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital. We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. At December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $12.1 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.4 billion that are due within the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial non-cancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. The Company had principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling $2.6 billion in 2014.  

The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and the amount of interest paid on its indebtedness.  

For 2015, the Company expects between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion of gross capital expenditures. See Notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.  

As of December 31, 2014, a substantial portion of the Companys assets, principally aircraft, route authorities and certain other intangible assets, were pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 11 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.  

Although access to the capital markets improved in recent years as evidenced by our financing transactions, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines.  

The following is a discussion of the Companys sources and uses of cash from 2012 through 2014.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

2014 compared to 2013  

The Companys cash from operating activities increased by $1.2 billion in 2014, as compared to 2013. Cash from operations increased primarily due to an increase in operating income and advanced ticket sales and a decrease in other working capital items in 2014.  

2013 compared to 2012  

The Companys cash from operating activities increased by $509 million in 2013, as compared to 2012. Cash from operations increased primarily due to the Companys improvement in earnings in 2013.

2014 compared to 2013  

The Companys capital expenditures were $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs.  

2013 compared to 2012  

The Companys capital expenditures were $2.2 billion and $2 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft and other fleet-related expenditures to improve the onboard experience of our customers on our existing aircraft.  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

Significant financing events in 2014 were as follows:  

Share Repurchases  

The Company used $320 million of cash to purchase 6.5 million shares of its common stock during 2014 under its $1 billion share repurchase program.

Significant financing events in 2013 were as follows:  

Debt Issuances  

During 2013, United issued debt related to three separate EETC offerings to finance new aircraft deliveries, bringing the total issued at year end 2013 pursuant to these three EETC offerings to $1.5 billion. Including the EETC offerings in 2012, United recorded $900 million of proceeds as debt during 2013.  

UAL issued $600 million unsecured Senior Notes.  

United and UAL entered into the Credit Agreement as the borrower and guarantor, respectively. The Companys Credit Agreement originally consisted of a $900 million term loan due April 1, 2019 and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility available for drawing until April 1, 2018.

       United redeemed all of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 and $200 million aggregate principal amount of 12.0% Senior Second Lien Notes due 2013.  

       United redeemed $303 million aggregate principal amount of EETC notes.  

Financing Activities Not Affecting Cash  

UAL issued approximately 28 million shares of UAL common stock pursuant to agreements that UAL entered into with certain of its securityholders in exchange for approximately $240 million in aggregate principal amount of UALs outstanding 6% Convertible Senior Notes held by the holders of these notes. The Company retired the 6% Convertible Senior Notes acquired in the exchange.  

Significant financing events in 2012 were as follows:  

The Company received $1.5 billion in proceeds from EETC transactions in 2012.  

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company made debt and capital lease payments of $1.5 billion, including prepayments. These payments include $195 million related to Uniteds Series 2002-1 EETCs.  

In August 2012, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (the Authority) issued approximately $101 million of special facility revenue bonds (the 2012 Bonds) to provide funds for the defeasance of approximately $100 million of the Authoritys previously issued and outstanding special facility revenue bonds maturing on September 15, 2012 (the Refunded Bonds). The Refunded Bonds were guaranteed by United and payable from certain rental payments made by United pursuant to two lease agreements between the Authority and United. The 2012 Bonds are payable from certain loan repayments made by United under a loan agreement between United and the Authority. The 2012 Bonds are recorded by the Company as unsecured long-term debt.

Credit Ratings. As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

*The credit agency does not issue corporate credit ratings for subsidiary entities.  

These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Below is a summary of additional liquidity matters. See the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Certain of the Companys financing agreements have covenants that impose certain operating and financial restrictions, as applicable, on the Company and its material subsidiaries.  

Contractual Obligations. The Companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.  

The table below provides a summary of the Companys material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (in billions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Long-term debt presented in the Companys financial statements is net of a $99 million debt discount which is being amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount. Contractual long-term debt includes $65 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a company that leases three aircraft from United. The creditors only recourse to United is repossession of the aircraft.

 (b) Includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $58 million in 2015, $52 million in 2016, $32 million in 2017, $23 million in 2018, $18 million in 2019 and $210 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.  

 (c) Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our CPAs and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. Amounts also exclude a portion of Uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its CPAs. See Note 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.  

 (d) Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2024. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.  

 (e) Represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for Uniteds material pension plans. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies, below, for a discussion of our current year assumptions regarding Uniteds pension plans.  

 (f) Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft and spare engines only and noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services, primarily information technology support. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. The Companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in Contractual Obligations, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.  

As of December 31, 2014, United had cash collateralized $74 million of letters of credit. United also had $410 million of performance bonds and letters of credit relating to various real estate, customs and aircraft financing obligations at December 31, 2014. Most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the performance bonds have expiration dates through 2019.  

As of December 31, 2014, United is the guarantor of approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in the Companys financial statements. The leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. The annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above.  

EETCs. In August 2014, April 2014 and August 2013, United completed three separate EETC offerings for a total principal amount of $2.9 billion. Of the $2.9 billion, United has received and recorded $2.0 billion of proceeds as debt as of December 31, 2014. United expects to receive all proceeds from the August 2014 pass-through trusts by the end of 2015. See Notes 11 and 14 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on EETC pass-through trusts and variable interest entity consideration.  

Increased Cost Provisions. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the Companys debt.  

Fuel Consortia. United participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $1.4 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United  

45  

Table of Contents 

 participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December 31, 2014, the Companys contingent exposure was approximately $239 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which range from 2015 to 2041. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.  

Passenger Revenue Recognition. The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. The Company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. When necessary, the Company records a reserve against our interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different. Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date.  

Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred. The fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection of fare, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Companys additional service to modify a previous sale. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes.  

The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends. Refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance.  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The amendments will become effective for the Companys annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017. Under the new standard, certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets, such as airline change fees and baggage fees, are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component. In addition, the change fees which were previously recognized when incurred, will likely be recognized when transportation is provided. The Company is evaluating other impacts on its consolidated financial statements.  

Frequent Flyer Accounting. The Companys MileagePlus program is designed to increase customer loyalty. Program participants earn miles by flying on United and certain other participating airlines. Program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in the Companys loyalty  

46  

Table of Contents 

 program. We sell miles to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. The Company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.  

In the case of the sale of air services, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. The miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the Companys balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided.  

The Company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. The total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis. The Companys estimated selling price of miles prior to April 1, 2014 was based on the price we sell miles to Star Alliance partners in our reciprocal frequent flyer agreements as the best estimate of selling price for these miles.  

On March 30, 2014, US Airways exited Star Alliance. Effective with the exit date, the Company updated its estimated selling price for miles to a value based on the equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles. The equivalent ticket value used as the basis for the estimated selling price of miles is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups. This change in estimate was applied on a prospective basis beginning April 1, 2014. The impact of this change resulted in an increase in consolidated revenue of approximately $95 million (and an increase of approximately $0.26 per UAL basic share and $0.24 per UAL diluted share) in 2014.  

United has a significant contract to sell MileagePlus miles to its co-branded credit card partner, Chase. United identified five revenue elements in the Co-Brand Agreement: the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the United brand and access to MileagePlus member lists; advertising; baggage services; and airport lounge usage (together, excluding the air transportation element, the marketing-related deliverables).  

The fair value of the elements is determined using managements estimated selling price of each element. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the Co-Brand Agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. The method for determining the selling price of the mile component changed March 30, 2014, as described above. We also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis.  

The Company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. The Company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. Miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity.  

The Companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.

The Company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered. The other elements are generally recognized as Other operating revenue when earned.  

The following table summarizes information related to the Companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Effective March 1, 2015, the Company will modify its MileagePlus program for most tickets from the current model in which members earn redeemable miles based on distance traveled to one based on ticket price (including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges). Members will be able to earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their MileagePlus status. The updated program will enhance the rewards for customers who spend more with United and give them improved mileage-earning opportunities.  

Long-Lived Assets. The net book value of operating property and equipment for the Company was $19 billion and $18 billion at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.  

The Company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the Companys fleet plan and other relevant information. A one-year increase in the average depreciable life of the Companys flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $50 million.  

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. For purposes of this testing, the Company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment. An impairment charge is recognized when the assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value.  

Defined Benefit Plan Accounting. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets.  

Uniteds pension plans under-funded status was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2014. Funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. In 2015, we anticipate contributing at least $400 million to our pension plans, substantially all of which is in excess of the minimum funding requirements. The fair value of the plans assets was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2014.  

When calculating pension expense for 2015, the Company assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.36%. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return reflects the active management of our plans assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results  

48  

Table of Contents 

 from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. Plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.  

The defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. Return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity and hedge funds). Risk mitigating investments include primarily U.S. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. The allocation of assets was as follows at December 31, 2014:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points (from 7.36% to 6.86%) would increase estimated 2015 pension expense by approximately $13 million.  

Future pension obligations for Uniteds plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 4.20% at December 31, 2014. The Company selected the 2014 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2014 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments.  

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 4.20% to 3.7%) would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2014 by approximately $532 million and increase the estimated 2015 pension expense by approximately $61 million.  

Future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. All gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of $982 million and $162 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  

During 2014, the Company experienced changes in its benefit obligations related to changes in discount rates and mortality tables in its pension plans. The Company used the Society of Actuaries 2014 mortality tables, modified to reflect the Social Security Administration Trustees Report on current projections regarding expected longevity improvements. See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to pension plans.  

Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Accounting. Uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the United States, to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as Other Benefits. United also has retiree medical programs that permit  

49  

Table of Contents 

 retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and Medicare eligibility. Eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. Plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles, and other limits as described in the plans.  

The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. Other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. United has not been required to pre-fund its plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below. The Companys benefit obligation was $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. The Company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The Companys weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of December 31, 2014 was 4.07%, as compared to 4.94% for December 31, 2013. The health care cost trend rate assumed for 2014 was 7.25%, declining to 5.0% in 2023, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2015 of 7.00%, declining to 5.0% in 2023. A 1% increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the Companys total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2014 by $13 million; whereas, a 1% decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the Companys total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2014 by $11 million. A one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the Companys postretirement benefit liability by approximately $247 million and increase the estimated 2014 benefits expense by approximately $10 million.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans. Under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $233 million and $555 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  

During 2014, the Company experienced changes in its benefit obligations related to changes in discount rates and mortality tables in its other postretirement benefit plans. The Company used the Society of Actuaries 2014 mortality tables, modified to reflect the Social Security Administration Trustees Report on current projections regarding expected longevity improvements. See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to other postretirement benefit plans.  

Income Taxes. Our effective tax rates are lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily because of the impact of changes to existing valuation allowances. We continue to provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will ultimately not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible. The Companys management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. To form a conclusion, management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences, projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies and negative evidence such as historical losses. Although the Company was not in a three-year cumulative loss position at the end of 2014, management determined that the low level of cumulative pretax income, combined with uncertainty about forecasted results,  

50  

Table of Contents 

 supports the conclusion that the valuation allowance is still necessary. Management will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowance. If we reverse the valuation allowance, we will begin to record income tax expense at an effective rate of approximately 37%. However, we will not pay significant cash taxes until we utilize our NOL carryforward of $9.6 billion.
