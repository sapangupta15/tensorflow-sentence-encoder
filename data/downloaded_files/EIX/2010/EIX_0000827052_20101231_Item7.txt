ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

     EDISON INTERNATIONAL OVERVIEW 

Edison International is a holding company whose operations are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiaries. Its principal wholly owned subsidiaries are SCE, a rate-regulated electric utility that supplies electric energy to an approximately 50,000 square-mile area of southern California; and EMG, a wholly owned competitive power generation company that operates in 12 states.  

 Highlights of Operating Results 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Includes termination of Edison Capital's cross-border leases in 2009 and state tax impact of the Global Settlement with the IRS.   

Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including lease terminations, sale of certain assets, early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings.  

SCE's 2010 core earnings increased $110 million primarily due to higher operating income and capitalized financing costs (AFUDC), both driven by higher rate base growth, and lower income tax expense. The lower tax expense in 2010 includes a change in the method of tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to SCE's infrastructure replacement program.  

EMG's 2010 core earnings decreased $30 million from 2009 primarily from higher plant maintenance costs in 2010 due to scheduled outages in EMG's merchant power plants, unrealized losses in 2010 compared to gains in 2009, higher income tax expense partially offset by higher energy trading revenues.

Table of Contents 

Edison International Parent and Other 2010 core losses increased from 2009 primarily due to higher interest and general and administrative costs.  

Consolidated non-core items for Edison International included:   

An after tax earnings benefit of $175 million recorded in 2010 relating to the California impact of the federal Global Settlement resulting from acceptance by the California Franchise Tax Board of tax positions finalized with the IRS in 2009 and a revision to interest recorded on the federal Global Settlement. In 2009, Edison International recorded an after-tax earnings charge of $254 million related to the Global Settlement with the IRS and termination of EMG's cross-border leases ($920 million pre-tax loss). For further discussion of the Global Settlement, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 7. Income Taxes."   

An after tax earnings charge of $39 million recorded in 2010 to reverse previously recognized federal tax benefits eliminated by the recently enacted federal health care legislation. The new health care law eliminated the federal tax deduction for retiree health care costs to the extent those costs are eligible for federal Medicare Part D subsidies.   

An after-tax earnings charge of $24 million ($40 million pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 resulting from the write-off of capitalized engineering and other costs for air emissions control technology that is not currently being pursued for use at the Powerton Station. These activities were previously suspended as Midwest Generation pursued testing and evaluation of the use of a dry sorbent injection system using Trona or similar sorbents which is expected to require lower capital costs. The Illinois EPA recently issued a construction permit to authorize installation of a dry sorbent injection system, which Midwest Generation currently expects to use if this project is undertaken. For further discussion, see "Environmental DevelopmentsMidwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs" below.   

An after-tax earnings benefit of $46 million recorded in 2009 resulting from the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base pursuant to CPUC and FERC approvals.  

See "SCE: Results of Operations" for discussion of SCE results of operations, including a comparison of 2009 results to 2008. Also, see "EMG: Results of Operations" for discussion of EMG results of operations, including a comparison of 2009 results to 2008.  

 Management Overview of SCE 

During 2009 and 2010, SCE focused on the execution of its capital investment program. Capital expenditures under the program were primarily for: upgrading, maintaining and expanding SCE's transmission and distribution system; extending the useful life of generation assets; and installing smart meters. Total capital expenditures were $2.9 billion in 2009 and $3.8 billion in 2010. A description of SCE's capital program for 2011  2014 and status of major rate cases is discussed below.  

 Capital Program 

SCE's capital program for 2011  2014 is focused primarily in the following areas:   

Maintaining reliability and expanding the capability of SCE's transmission and distribution system.   

Upgrading and constructing new transmission lines for system reliability and increased access to renewable energy, including the Tehachapi, Devers-Colorado River, Eldorado-Ivanpah, Red Bluff and Alberhill projects.   

Generation investments for nuclear and hydro-electric plant betterment projects and general facilities and technology needs.   

Installing "smart" meters in households and small businesses, referred to as EdisonSmartConnect. Through 2010, SCE installed 2 million smart meters and plans to complete installation of the remaining 3.3 million meters during 2011 and 2012.  

36 

Table of Contents 

SCE forecasts capital expenditures in the range of $15.6 billion to $17.5 billion for 2011  2014. The rate of actual capital spending may be affected by permitting, regulatory, market and other factors as discussed further under "SCE: Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Investment Plan." SCE plans to utilize cash generated from its operations, tax benefits and issuance of additional debt and preferred equity to fund its capital needs.  

 SCE Rate Cases 

     2012 CPUC General Rate Case 

On November 23, 2010, SCE filed its 2012 GRC application requesting a 2012 base rate revenue requirement of $6.3 billion. After considering the effects of sales growth, SCE's request would be an $866 million increase in 2012 base rate revenue. The requested revenue requirement increase is driven by investments in capital projects to maintain system reliability and accommodate customer load growth, as well as an increase in operation and maintenance expenses primarily for capital-related projects, information technology, insurance premiums and pension contributions. If the CPUC approves the requested rate increase, the system average rate increase over base rate and total revenue requirement is estimated to be 16.2% and 7.6%, respectively. The increase excludes the impact of rate changes not associated with the CPUC GRC, such as rates to recover purchased power. The application also proposes a ratemaking mechanism that would result in 2013 and 2014 incremental base rate revenue requirement increases, net of sales growth of $246 million and $527 million, respectively, driven by the same reasons.  

SCE is required to update its 2012 GRC request to reflect, among other items, the impacts of governmental and legislative actions. As part of this update, SCE expects the base rate revenue requirement will be reduced to reflect bonus depreciation (discussed below in "Bonus Depreciation Impact on Edison International"). Bonus depreciation is an acceleration of future tax deductions which results in a reduction to rate base. SCE intends to update its 2012 GRC request after the IRS issues final regulations.  

The current schedule anticipates a final decision on SCE's 2012 GRC by the end of 2011. SCE cannot predict the revenue requirement the CPUC will ultimately authorize or when a final decision will be adopted.  

 FERC 2010 Rate Case 

In February 2011, the FERC approved a settlement agreement in SCE's 2010 FERC rate case that provides a FERC retail base revenue requirement of $490 million, an increase of $42 million, or 9.4%, over the 2009 FERC base revenue requirement. The increased revenue requirement is primarily due to an increase in transmission capital investments and will be retroactive to March 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, SCE had collected revenue, subject to refund, of $58 million that will be refunded to ratepayers. SCE did not previously recognize revenue for the amount that will be refunded.  

 NRC Oversight of San Onofre 

SCE continues to apply increased management focus and other resources to San Onofre to address regulatory and performance issues identified by the NRC (see "Item 1. BusinessSouthern California Edison CompanyRegulationNuclear Power Plant Regulation" for further discussion).  

 Management Overview of EMG 

EMG's competitive power generation business primarily consists of the generation and sale into the PJM market of energy and capacity from its approximately 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants. The profitability of these operations is expected to decline significantly in 2011 as a result of lower realized energy prices (largely driven by the expiration of hedge contracts) and higher fuel costs. In addition, the profitability of EMG's Midwest Generation plants is expected to be adversely affected in 2012 by a decline in capacity prices (projected to begin in June 2012) and higher rail transportation costs (due to the expiration at the end of 2011 of a favorable long-term rail contract). For discussion of energy and fuel price risks, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price Risk" and "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to EMGMarket Risks." As a result of the projected decrease in profitability of EMG's merchant  

37 

Table of Contents 

activities, EMG may incur net losses during 2011 and in subsequent years unless energy prices recover or its costs decline.  

At December 31, 2010, EMG and its subsidiaries had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $981 million of liquidity available from credit facilities that expire in 2012. EMG's principal subsidiary, EME, had $3.7 billion of notes outstanding at December 31, 2010, $500 million of which mature in 2013. EMG business plans are focused on operating effectively through the current commodity price cycle and on environmental compliance and renewable energy plans as described below.  

 Environmental Developments 

     Midwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs 

During 2010, Midwest Generation continued its permitting and planning activities for NOx and SO2 controls to meet the requirements of the CPS. Midwest Generation has received all necessary permits from the Illinois EPA to allow the installation of SNCR technology on multiple units to meet the NOx portion of the CPS. In November 2010 and February 2011, the Illinois EPA issued construction permits authorizing Midwest Generation to install a dry sorbent injection system using Trona or its equivalent at the Waukegan generating station's Unit 7 and Units 5 and 6 at the Powerton Station. The permit for Unit 7 for the Waukegan Station also authorizes Midwest Generation to convert the existing electrostatic precipitator to a cold-side design which will improve removal efficiency of particulate matter to satisfy the particulate control requirements of the CPS.  

Testing of dry scrubbing using Trona on select Midwest Generation units has demonstrated significant reductions in SO2 emissions. Use of this technology in conjunction with low sulfur coal is expected to require substantially less capital and time than the use of spray dryer absorber technology, but would likely result in higher ongoing operating costs and may consequently result in lower dispatch rates and competitiveness of Midwest Generation's plants, depending on competitors' costs.  

Based on work to date, Midwest Generation estimates the cost of retrofitting all units, using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents to comply with CPS requirements for SO2 emissions, and the associated upgrading of existing particulate removal systems, would be approximately $1.2 billion in 2010 dollars. If these projects are undertaken, these expenditures would be incurred through 2018.  

Decisions regarding whether or not to proceed with the above projects or other approaches to compliance remain subject to a number of factors, such as market conditions, regulatory and legislative developments, and forecasted commodity prices and capital and operating costs applicable at the time decisions are required or made. Midwest Generation could also elect to shut down units, instead of installing controls, to be in compliance with the CPS. Therefore, decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ also remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made. Due to existing uncertainties about these factors, Midwest Generation intends to defer final decisions about particular units for the maximum time available. Accordingly, final decisions on whether to install controls, to install particular kinds of controls, and to actually expend capital that is budgeted may not occur until 2012 for some of the units and potentially later for others. Preconstruction engineering and initial construction work on a project may occur in 2011 in advance of a final decision to continue or complete the project.  

 Homer City Environmental Issues and Capital Resource Limitations 

Homer City may be required to install additional environmental equipment on Units 1 and 2 to comply with environmental regulations under the Transport Rule. Homer City projects that if SO2 reduction technology becomes required, it may need to make capital commitments for such equipment several years in advance of the effective date of such requirements. Homer City continues to review technologies available to reduce SO2 and mercury emissions and to monitor developments related to hazardous pollutants and other environmental regulations. The timing, selection of technology and required capital costs remain uncertain. The installation of environmental compliance equipment will be dependent on lessor decisions regarding the funding of these expenditures. Restrictions under the agreements entered into as part of Homer City's 2001 sale-leaseback transaction could affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, Homer City's ability to incur indebtedness or make capital expenditures. EME has no legal  

38 

Table of Contents 

obligation to provide funding. Accordingly, final decisions on whether to install controls, to install particular kinds of controls, and to actually expend capital have not been made.  

 EMG Renewable Program 

At December 31, 2010, EMG had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately 3,600 MW and had four projects totaling 480 MW under construction. EMG anticipates that these projects will achieve commercial operation in 2011. In addition to the projects under construction at December 31, 2010, EMG expects the 55 MW Pinnacle project in West Virginia will commence construction in 2011 with anticipated commercial operation in 2011. The pace of additional growth in EMG's renewable program will be subject to the availability of third-party capital.  

 Bonus Depreciation Impact on Edison International 

The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 ("2010 Tax Relief Act") extended 50% bonus depreciation for qualifying property through 2012 and created a new 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying property placed in service between September 9, 2010 and December 31, 2011. In addition to the update of the 2012 GRC discussed above, these provisions are expected to:   

result in a consolidated net operating loss for federal income tax purposes for 2010 and 2011;   

provide additional cash flow benefits during 2011 to SCE of approximately $550 million;   

delay tax-allocation payments to EMG until tax benefits are fully utilized by Edison International on a consolidated basis which may take several years; and   

eliminate income tax benefits from the domestic production activities deduction (also known as Section 199 deductions) of $16 million in 2011. The negative impact on 2010 net income was $15 million from recapture of 2008 Section 199 deductions realized in prior years resulting from the carry back of net operating losses.  

The impact on cash flow represents an acceleration of tax benefits that would have otherwise been deductible over the life of the qualifying assets.

 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY 

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

SCE's results of operations are derived mainly through two sources:   

Utility earning activities  representing CPUC and FERC-authorized base rates, including an authorized reasonable return, and CPUC-authorized incentive mechanisms; and   

Utility cost-recovery activities  representing CPUC-authorized balancing accounts which allow for recovery of costs incurred or provide for mechanisms to track and recover or refund differences in forecasted and actual amounts.  

Utility earning activities include base rates that are designed to recover forecasted operation and maintenance costs, certain capital-related carrying costs, interest (including interest on balancing accounts), taxes and a return, including the return on capital projects recovered through balancing account mechanisms. Differences between authorized amounts and actual results impact earnings. Also, included in utility earning activities are revenues or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue, and regulatory charges or disallowances, if any.  

Utility cost-recovery activities include rates that provide for recovery, subject to reasonableness review, of fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs), certain operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation expense related to certain projects. There is no return for cost-recovery expenses.

 Electric Utility Results of Operations 

The following table is a summary of SCE's results of operations for the periods indicated. The presentation below separately identifies utility earning activities and utility cost-recovery activities.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Effective January 1, 2010, SCE deconsolidated the Big 4 projects and therefore these projects are no longer reflected in 2010 activities (see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Variable Interest Entities" for further discussion). 

2Effective July 1, 2009, SCE transferred Mountainview Power Company, LLC to SCE (see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2. Property, Plant and Equipment" for further discussion). As a result of the transfer and for comparability purposes, Mountainview's 2009 and 2008 activities were reclassified from cost-recovery activities to utility earning activities consistent with the 2010 regulatory recovery mechanism. 

3See use of Non-GAAP financial measures in "Edison International OverviewHighlights of Operating Results."   

 Utility Earning Activities 

     2010 vs. 2009 

Utility earning activities were primarily affected by the following:   

Higher operating revenue of $303 million primarily due to the following:   

$190 million increase related to the implementation of SCE's 2009 GRC (effective January 1, 2009) which authorized an increase of approximately $205 million ($15 million of which is reflected in utility cost-recovery activities) from SCE's 2009 revenue requirement.   

$55 million increase in FERC-related revenue, primarily due to the implementation of SCE's 2010 and 2009 FERC rate cases effective March 1, 2010 and March 1, 2009, respectively (see    

41 

Table of Contents    

"Edison International OverviewSCE Rate Cases2010 FERC Rate Case" for further discussion).    

$55 million increase related to capital-related revenue requirements recovered through CPUC-authorized mechanisms outside of the GRC process primarily related to the steam generator replacement project and the EdisonSmartConnectTM project.   

Higher operation and maintenance expense of $160 million primarily due to the following:   

$75 million of higher expenses to support company growth programs, including new information technology system requirements and facility maintenance.   

$45 million of higher transmission and distribution expenses to support system reliability and infrastructure replacement, right of way costs; preventive maintenance work, technical training and line clearing.   

$15 million of higher generation expenses primarily from a $25 million increase from the San Onofre Unit 2 and 3 scheduled outages, including $10 million of additional work identified during the Unit 2 scheduled outage, and a $10 million increase primarily due to overhaul and outage costs at Four Corners. These increases were partially offset by a $20 million decrease resulting from 2009 scheduled outages at the Mountainview power plant.       

SCE completed the replacement of the steam generators at San Onofre Unit 2 and Unit 3 in April 2010 and February 2011, respectively. During the San Onofre Unit 2 scheduled outage, SCE identified and completed additional work unrelated to the steam generator replacement that resulted in increased operation and maintenance expense and extended the outage beyond SCE's initial estimated timeframe. The San Onofre Unit 3 outage was briefly extended beyond SCE's initial estimated timeframe.  

The CPUC previously adopted a mechanism establishing thresholds for review and recovery of SCE's incurred capital costs for the steam generator replacements. Based on preliminary cost information, SCE does not expect a reasonableness review will be required. SCE will file an application with the CPUC setting forth its final costs and compliance with the adopted mechanism.    

$15 million of higher expense related to general liability and property insurance due to higher premiums for wildfire coverage.   

Higher depreciation expense of $89 million primarily related to increased capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs.   

Higher net interest expense and other of $32 million primarily due to:   

Lower other income of $19 million primarily related to a decrease in AFUDC  equity earnings due to the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base in the third quarter of 2009 partially offset by an increase in AFUDC  equity resulting from a higher capitalization rate and level of construction in progress associated with SCE's capital expenditure plan.   

Higher interest expense of $7 million primarily due to higher outstanding balances on long-term debt.    

See "Income Taxes" below for discussion of higher income taxes during 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  

42 

Table of Contents 

 2009 vs. 2008 

Utility earning activities were primarily affected by:   

Higher operating revenue of $447 million primarily due to the following:   

$485 million increase resulting from the implementation of SCE's 2009 CPUC GRC decision which authorized an increase of $512 million ($27 million of which is reflected in utility cost-recovery activities) from SCE's 2008 revenue requirement effective January 1, 2009.   

$114 million increase resulting from the implementation of SCE's 2009 FERC approved rate case settlement effective March 1, 2009.   

$25 million decrease due to the presentation of revenue requirements for medical, dental, and vision expenses and SCE's share of Palo Verde operation and maintenance expenses, which beginning in 2009 are reflected in utility cost-recovery activities consistent with the balancing account ratemaking treatment authorized in SCE's 2009 GRC.   

Higher operation and maintenance expenses of $32 million primarily due to:   

$105 million of higher transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to higher costs to support system reliability and infrastructure projects, increases in preventive maintenance work, as well as engineering costs.   

$50 million of higher expenses related to regulatory and performance issues, including the NRC requiring SCE to take action to provide greater assurance of compliance by San Onofre personnel with applicable NRC requirements and procedures (See "Item 1. BusinessSouthern California Edison Company RegulationNuclear Power Plant Regulation" for further discussion).   

$50 million of higher expenses associated with new information technology system requirements and facility maintenance to support company growth programs.   

$175 million decrease due to presentation of medical, dental and vision expenses and SCE's share of Palo Verde operations and maintenance expenses, which beginning in 2009 are reflected in cost-recovery activities consistent with the balancing account ratemaking treatment authorized in SCE's 2009 GRC.   

Higher depreciation expense of $69 million primarily resulting from increased capital expenditures including capitalized software costs.   

Lower net interest expense and other of $116 million primarily due to:   

Lower other expenses of $71 million primarily due to a final charge of $60 million ($49 million after-tax) recorded in 2008 resulting from the CPUC decision on SCE's PBR mechanism, as well as a $14 million decrease in civic, political and related activity expenditures primarily related to spending on Proposition 7 in 2008. These decreases were partially offset by an $8 million increase in donations.   

Higher other income of $61 million due to an increase in AFUDC  equity earnings primarily resulting from a $50 million one-time gain resulting from the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base authorized in SCE's 2009 GRC and a $12 million increase resulting from a higher level of construction work in progress associated with SCE's capital expenditure program.   

Higher interest expense of $8 million primarily due to higher outstanding balances on long-term debt partially offset by lower interest expense on short-term borrowings. Due to an increase in cash flow from operations, including the positive cash impact from the Global Settlement and other tax timing differences, SCE was able to defer some of its expected financings in 2009 to support its growth programs.

See "Income Taxes" below for discussion of lower income taxes during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.  

 Utility Cost-Recovery Activities 

     2010 vs. 2009 

Utility cost-recovery activities excludes the impact of the consolidation of the Big 4 projects in 2009 for comparability purposes. The following amounts were excluded for 2009: $370 million for purchased power expense to reflect the elimination of sales between the VIEs and SCE; $368 million for fuel expense; and $94 million for operation and maintenance expense. Utility cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by:   

Lower purchased power expense of $191 million related to: lower realized losses on economic hedging activities ($156 million in 2010 compared to $344 million in 2009) reflecting the impact of higher natural gas prices and changes in SCE's hedge portfolio mix; lower bilateral energy purchase expense of $50 million primarily due to decreased kWh purchases associated with overall lower kWh demand; and lower net ISO-related and other energy costs of $50 million primarily due to milder weather experienced during 2010 compared to 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the purchase of replacement power costs related to the San Onofre Unit 2 extended outage and higher QF and renewable purchased power expense of $85 million primarily due to higher natural gas prices.   

Higher fuel expense of $10 million related to a $25 million increase at the Mountainview power plant resulting from higher natural gas prices and a $10 million decrease at Four Corners resulting from a planned outage in 2010.   

Higher operation and maintenance expense of $71 million primarily due to an increase in spending for various public purpose programs.  

 2009 vs. 2008 

Utility cost-recovery activities excludes the impact of the consolidation of the Big 4 projects in 2009 and 2008 for comparability purposes. In addition to the 2009 amounts noted above, the following amounts were excluded for 2008: $692 million for purchased power expense to reflect the elimination of sales between the VIEs and SCE; $813 million for fuel expense; and $90 million for operation and maintenance expense. Utility cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by:   

Lower purchased power expense of $1.4 billion primarily due to: lower bilateral energy and QF purchases of $1.6 billion primarily due to lower natural gas prices and decreased kWh purchases; and lower firm transmission rights costs of $65 million due to implementation of CAISO's MRTU market; and a change in net realized losses due to settled natural gas prices being significantly lower than average fixed prices. Realized losses on economic hedging activities were $344 million in 2009 and $60 million in 2008.   

Lower fuel expense of $234 million primarily due to lower costs at the Mountainview plant resulting from lower natural gas costs in 2009 compared to 2008.   

Higher operation and maintenance expense of $105 million primarily related to the presentation of $185 million of medical, dental, and vision expenses and its share of Palo Verde operation and maintenance expenses which beginning in 2009 are reflected in cost-recovery activities consisting with the balancing account ratemaking treatment authorized in SCE's 2009 GRC. In addition, SCE recorded higher pension and PBOP expenses of $60 million due to the volatile market conditions experienced in 2008. These increases were partially offset by $50 million of lower energy efficiency costs and $85 million of lower transmission access and reliability service charges.  

 Supplemental Operating Revenue Information 

SCE's retail billed and unbilled revenue (excluding wholesale sales and balancing account over/undercollections) was $10 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.3 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The 2010 and 2009 increases reflect a rate increase of $777 million and $564 million, respectively, and a sales volume decrease  

44 

Table of Contents 

of $255 million and $380 million, respectively. The 2010 rate increase was due to higher system average rates for 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 mainly due to the implementation of the CPUC 2009 GRC decision and approved FERC transmission rate changes. The 2010 sales volume decrease was primarily due to milder weather experienced during 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Economic conditions continued to contribute to the sales volume decrease. The 2009 rate increase reflects a rate change effective April 4, 2009 due to the implementation of both revenue allocation and rate design changes authorized in Phase 2 of the 2009 GRC and the FERC transmission rate changes authorized in the 2009 FERC Rate Case. The 2009 sales volume decrease was due to the economic downturn as well as the milder weather experienced in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. As a result of the CPUC-authorized decoupling mechanism, SCE does not bear the volumetric risk related to retail electricity sales (see "Item 1. BusinessSouthern California Edison CompanyOverview of Ratemaking Mechanisms").  

SCE remits to CDWR and does not recognize as revenue the amounts that SCE bills and collects from its customers for electric power purchased and sold by the CDWR to SCE's customers, CDWR bond-related costs and a portion of direct access exit fees. The amounts collected and remitted to CDWR were $1.2 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Effective January 1, 2010, the CDWR-related rates were decreased to reflect lower power procurement expenses and to refund operating reserves that CDWR can release as these contracts begin to terminate. The remaining power contracts that CDWR allocated to SCE will terminate by the end of 2011. SCE's revenue and related purchased power expense is expected to increase as these CDWR contracts are replaced by power purchase agreements entered into by SCE.  

 Income Taxes 

The table below provides an analysis of the principal factors impacting SCE's effective tax rate.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1During the second quarter of 2010, the IRS approved SCE's request to change its tax accounting method for asset removal costs primarily related to its infrastructure replacement program. As a result, SCE recognized a $40 million earnings benefit ($28 million of which relates to asset removal costs incurred prior to 2010) from deducting asset removal costs earlier in the construction cycle. These deductions are recorded on a flow-through basis. 

2During the first quarter of 2010, SCE recognized a $39 million non-cash charge to reverse previously recognized federal tax benefits eliminated by the federal health care legislation enacted in March 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, includes a provision that eliminates the federal tax deduction for retiree health care costs to the extent those costs are eligible for federal Medicare Part D subsidies. Although this change does not take effect until January 1, 2013, SCE is required to recognize the full accounting impact of the legislation in its financial statements in the period of enactment.   

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

SCE's ability to operate its business, complete planned capital projects, and implement its business strategy are dependent upon its cash flow and access to the capital markets to finance its activities. SCE's overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its

customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, dividend payments made to Edison International, and the outcome of tax and regulatory matters.  

SCE expects to fund its continuing obligations and projected capital expenditures for 2011 and dividends to Edison International through cash and equivalents on hand, operating cash flows, tax benefits and capital market financings of debt and preferred equity, as needed. SCE also has availability under its credit facilities if additional funding and liquidity are necessary to meet operating and capital requirements.  

 Available Liquidity 

As of December 31, 2010, SCE had approximately $257 million of cash and equivalents. SCE had two credit facilities: a $2.4 billion five-year credit facility that matures in February 2013, with four one-year options to extend by mutual consent, and a $500 million three-year credit facility that matures in March 2013.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Debt Covenant 

SCE has a debt covenant in its credit facilities that limits its debt to total capitalization ratio to less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2010, SCE's debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.46 to 1.  

 Capital Investment Plan 

SCE's capital expenditures for 2011  2014 include a capital forecast in the range of $15.6 billion to $17.5 billion. The 2011 planned capital expenditures for projects under CPUC jurisdiction are recovered through the authorized revenue requirement in SCE's 2009 GRC or through other CPUC-authorized mechanisms. Recovery of the 2012  2014 planned capital expenditures for projects under CPUC jurisdiction and not already approved through other CPUC-authorized mechanisms, is subject to the outcome of the 2012 CPUC GRC or other CPUC approvals. The 2011 planned capital expenditures for projects under FERC jurisdiction are recovered through the authorized FERC revenue requirement. Recovery of the 2012  2014 planned capital expenditures under FERC jurisdiction will be requested in future FERC transmission filings, as applicable.  

The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, weather and other unforeseen conditions.  

SCE's capital expenditures (including accruals) in 2010 were $3.8 billion. The estimated capital expenditures for the next four years may vary from SCE's current forecast in a range of $15.6 billion to $17.5 billion based on the average variability experienced in 2009 and 2010 of 10.5%. SCE's 2010 capital expenditures

and the 2011  2014 capital expenditures forecast, including the two-year historical average variability to the current forecast, is set forth in the table below:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Included in SCE's capital expenditures plan are projected environmental capital expenditures of $397 million in 2011. The projected environmental capital expenditures are to comply with laws, regulations, and other nondiscretionary requirements.   

 Distribution Projects 

Distribution expenditures include projects and programs to meet customer load growth requirements, reliability and infrastructure replacement needs, information and other technology and related facility requirements. Of the total forecasted distribution expenditures, $2.0 billion are recoverable through rates authorized in SCE's 2009 CPUC GRC decision, and $7.1 billion are subject to review and approval in the 2012 CPUC GRC proceeding.  

 Transmission Projects 

SCE's has planned the following significant transmission projects:   

Tehachapi Transmission Project  an 11-segment project consisting of new and upgraded transmission lines and associated substations primarily built to enhance reliability and enable the delivery of renewable energy generated primarily by wind farms in remote areas of eastern Kern County, California. Tehachapi segments 1, 2 and a portion of segment 3 were completed and placed in service in 2009. The remainder of segment 3 is under construction and expected to be placed in service over the period 2012  2013. SCE continues to seek the necessary licensing permits for Tehachapi segments 4 through 11, which are expected to be placed in service between 2011 and 2015, subject to receipt of licensing and regulatory approvals. SCE expects to invest $1.3 billion over the period 2011  2014 on this project. The FERC approved a 125 basis point ROE project adder, a 50 basis point incentive for CAISO participation, 100% CWIP in rate base treatment, and the ability to seek recovery of 100% abandoned plant costs (if any) on this project.   

Devers-Colorado River Project  a transmission project involving the installation of a high voltage (500 kV) transmission line from western Riverside County, California to the Colorado River switchyard west of Blythe, California. The project is currently expected to be placed in service in 2013, subject to final licensing and regulatory approvals. Over the period 2011  2013, SCE expects to invest $655 million for this project. The FERC approved a 100 basis point ROE project adder, a 50 basis point adder for CAISO participation, 100% CWIP in rate base treatment and the ability to seek recovery of 100% abandoned plant costs (if any) on this project.   

Eldorado-Ivanpah Transmission Project  a proposed 220/115 kV substation near Primm, Nevada and an upgrade of a 35-mile portion of an existing transmission line connecting the new substation to the Eldorado Substation, near Boulder City, Nevada. The project is currently expected to be placed in service in 2013, subject to necessary licensing and regulatory approvals. SCE expects to invest $483 million over the period 2011  2013 on this project. The FERC approved a 50 basis point incentive for CAISO participation, 100% CWIP in rate base treatment, and the ability to seek recovery of 100% abandoned plant costs (if any) on this project.

 Table of Contents   

Red Bluff Substation Project  a substation project that consists of a new 500/220 kV substation that loops into the existing Devers-Palo Verde 500 kV transmission line near Desert Center in Riverside County, California. The project is currently expected to be placed in service in 2013, subject to final licensing and regulatory approvals. SCE expects to invest $225 million over the period 2011  2013 on this project. The FERC approved 100% CWIP in rate base treatment and the ability to seek recovery of 100% abandoned plant costs (if any) on this project.   

Other capital investments consisting of $2.3 billion to maintain reliability and expand capability of its infrastructure over the period 2011  2014.  

 Generation Projects 

Generation expenditures of $2.3 billion include:   

Nuclear-related capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and reliable plant operation, meet NRC and other regulatory requirements, and optimize plant performance and cost-effectiveness.   

Hydro-related capital expenditures associated with required infrastructure and equipment replacement and ongoing efforts to renew FERC licenses. Infrastructure expenditures generally include projects such as dam improvements, flowline and substation refurbishments, and powerline replacements. Equipment replacement expenditures generally include projects for transformers, automation, switchgear, hydro turbine repowers, generator rewinds, and small generator replacements.  

 EdisonSmartConnectTM 

SCE's EdisonSmartConnectTM project involves installing state-of-the-art "smart" meters in approximately 5.3 million households and small businesses through its service territory. In March 2008, SCE was authorized by the CPUC to recover $1.63 billion in customer rates for the deployment phase of EdisonSmartConnectTM. In 2009, SCE began full deployment of meters to all residential and small business customers under 200 kW. SCE anticipates completion of the deployment in 2012.  

 Solar Rooftop Program 

In June 2009, the CPUC approved SCE's Solar Photovoltaic Program to develop up to 250 MW of utility-owned Solar Photovoltaic generating facilities generally ranging in size from 1 to 2 MW each, on commercial and industrial rooftops and other space in SCE's service territory. The CPUC has authorized recovery of reasonable costs and allowed for a return on its investment. In February 2011, SCE filed an application with the CPUC to reduce the maximum utility owned solar projects from 250 MW to 125 MW and to allow SCE to purchase power from new solar projects up to 125 MW in a separate solicitation not subject to the same parameters as the original Program. SCE filed this application to permit greater competition and reduce overall solar program customer costs. SCE's capital expenditures for the period 2011  2014 reflect this reduction in procurement obligations and related estimated cost savings.  

 Regulatory Proceedings 

     Energy Efficiency Shareholder Mechanism 

In December 2010, the CPUC issued a decision approving a $24 million final payment for 2006  2008 performance under the Energy Efficiency Mechanism and also modifying the mechanism. The modified mechanism will also be applied to the 2009 energy efficiency program year. SCE anticipates filing an application with the CPUC for incentives related to the 2009 program year performance, in the first half of 2011.  

Based on the modified mechanism, SCE may recognize a 2009 program year payment of up to an estimated $27 million by December 2011; however, there is no assurance that SCE will receive any payment for that period. Additionally, the CPUC may further modify or eliminate this mechanism. See "Item 1. BusinessSouthern California Edison CompanyRegulationEnergy Efficiency Shareholder Risk/Reward Incentive Mechanism" for further information on the Energy Efficiency Mechanism for the 2009 program year and the potential 2010  2012 mechanism.

Table of Contents 

 Ratemaking Mechanism to Track Bonus Depreciation 

The CPUC has proposed a resolution that establishes a memorandum account to track the base rate revenue requirement reduction, if any, associated with the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the 2010 Tax Relief Act from the effective date of the resolution to the effective date of SCE's 2012 GRC decision. The CPUC will determine at a future date whether rates should be changed to reflect any benefits attributable to these Acts. The impact on the 2011 base rate revenue requirement is dependent upon, the ratemaking mechanism adopted, the final IRS regulations, the timing and amount of actual capital expenditures, working capital requirements and work order closings.  

 Dividend Restrictions  

The CPUC regulates SCE's capital structure and limits the dividends it may pay Edison International. In SCE's most recent cost of capital proceeding, the CPUC set an authorized capital structure for SCE which included a common equity component of 48%. SCE may make distributions to Edison International as long as the common equity component of SCE's capital structure remains at or above the 48% authorized level on a 13-month weighted average basis. At December 31, 2010, SCE's 13-month weighted-average common equity component of total capitalization was 51% resulting in the capacity to pay $497 million in additional dividends.  

During 2010, SCE made a total of $300 million of dividend payments to its parent, Edison International, and in February 2011 declared a $115 million dividend to Edison International which is payable in March 2011. Future dividend amounts and timing of distributions are dependent upon several factors including the actual level of capital expenditures, operating cash flows and earnings.  

 Income Tax Matters 

     Repair Deductions 

In 2009, Edison International made a voluntary election to change its tax accounting method for certain repair costs incurred on SCE's transmission, distribution and generation assets. The change in tax accounting method resulted in a $192 million cash benefit realized in the fourth quarter of 2009. This initial benefit was based on an estimated cumulative catch-up deduction for certain repair costs that were previously capitalized and depreciated over the tax depreciable life of the property. The deduction reflected on the 2009 income tax return was consistent with this cash benefit. The amount claimed on the 2009 tax return may be revised in the future based on further guidance from the IRS. The income tax benefit from the change in accounting for repair costs represents a timing difference which will reverse over the estimated remaining tax life of the assets. This method change, and incremental deductions taken in 2009 and 2010, did not impact SCE's 2009 or 2010 results of operations. Regulatory treatment for future increases in income taxes related to this matter will be addressed in SCE's 2012 GRC. SCE has not recognized an earnings benefit or regulatory asset, as the regulatory treatment is pending.  

 Margin and Collateral Deposits 

     Derivative Instruments and Power Procurement Contracts 

Certain derivative instruments and power procurement contracts under SCE's power and natural gas hedging activities contain collateral requirements. SCE has historically provided collateral in the form of cash and/or letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties. Collateral requirements can vary depending upon the level of unsecured credit extended by counterparties, changes in market prices relative to contractual commitments, and other factors. Future collateral requirements may be higher (or lower) than requirements at December 31, 2010, due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on SCE's contractual obligations.  

Certain of these power procurement contracts contain a provision that requires SCE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. If SCE's credit rating were to fall below investment grade, SCE may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral. The table  

49 

Table of Contents 

below illustrates the amount of collateral posted by SCE to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of December 31, 2010.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Collateral posted consisted of $4 million which was offset against net derivative liabilities and $29 million provided to counterparties and other brokers (consisting of $5 million in cash reflected in "Other current assets" on the consolidated balance sheets and $24 million in letters of credit). 

2Total posted and potential collateral requirements may increase by an additional $19 million, based on SCE's forward positions as of December 31, 2010, due to adverse market price movements over the remaining life of the existing power procurement contracts using a 95% confidence level.   

 Potential Regulation of Swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act may impact margin, capital and collateral requirements in the future. See "Edison International (Consolidated)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesPotential Regulation of Swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act" for further discussion.  

 Workers Compensation Self-Insurance Fund 

SCE is self-insured for workers compensation claims. SCE assesses workers compensation claims that have been asserted and those that have been incurred but not reported to determine the probable amount of losses that should be recorded. The Department of Industrial Relations for the State of California requires companies that are self-insured for workers compensation to post collateral (in the form of cash and/or letters of credits) based on the estimated workers' compensation liability if a company's bond rating were to fall below "B." As of December 31, 2010, if SCE's bond rating were to fall below a "B" rating, SCE would be required to post $209 million for its workers compensation self-insurance plan.  

 Regulatory Balancing Accounts 

SCE's cash flows are affected by regulatory balancing account over or under collections. Balancing account over and under collections represent differences between cash collected in current rates and the costs incurred related to these regulatory mechanisms. In general, SCE seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis to recover or refund the balances recorded in certain balancing accounts. However, some over collections relate to specific programs that the CPUC has established annual funding levels in which funds must be spent by a certain date and therefore these over collections are not necessarily included in annual rate changes. Balancing account under collections and over collections accrue interest based on a three-month commercial paper rate published by the Federal Reserve.  

As of December 31, 2010, balancing account net over collections were $1.3 billion primarily related to base rate differences, fuel and power procurement-related costs (ERRA) and various public purpose related-program costs. SCE expects to refund the base rate and ERRA combined over collection of $516 million through a rate adjustment beginning on June 1, 2011. The remaining over collections are expected to decrease as costs are incurred, amounts are refunded to ratepayers, or used to fund future programs established by the CPUC. Balancing account over or under collections may fluctuate due to, among other things, changes in: sales volume driven by growth or declines in customer base and weather; procurement-related costs driven both by market prices and sales volumes; and timing of expenditures under certain public purpose programs.

 Historical Segment Cash Flows  

The table below sets forth condensed historical cash flow information for SCE:  

 Condensed Statement of Cash Flows  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating activities decreased $683 million in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily due to the following:   

$531 million decrease in cash reflecting lower net tax receipts in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily related to the impacts of the Global Settlement. In 2009, SCE received tax-allocation payments of $875 million from the Global Settlement, compared to tax-allocation payments received of $26 million in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by higher estimated tax payments in 2009 compared to 2010.   

$155 million net cash inflow from balancing accounts composed of:   

$310 million net cash inflow from the funding of public purpose and solar initiative programs and lower pension and PBOP contributions in 2010 compared to 2009; and   

$155 million net cash outflow due to the decrease in ERRA balancing account cash flows (collections of approximately $300 million in 2010, compared to collections of approximately $450 million in 2009). The ERRA balancing account was over-collected by $345 million at December 31, 2010, over-collected by $46 million at December 31, 2009 and under-collected by $406 million at December 31, 2008.   

Timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to working capital items, including a net cash outflow of $95 million related to the timing of fuel and power procurement-related activities primarily related to ISO charges and a $60 million decrease in margin and collateral deposits  net of collateral received.  

Cash provided by operating activities increased $2.4 billion in 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily due to the following:   

$875 million cash inflow from the receipt of payments due to Global Settlement related to the settlement of affirmative claims, a portion of which is timing and will be payable in future periods.   

$468 million net cash inflow due to the increase in balancing account cash flows composed of:   

$1.3 billion net cash inflow due to the increase in ERRA balancing account cash flows (collections of approximately $450 million in 2009, compared to refunds of approximately $840 million in 2008).   

$820 million net cash outflow related to increased spending in 2009 compared to 2008 for public purpose and solar initiative programs and increased pension and PBOP contributions. In addition, a $200 million refund payment was received in 2008 related to public purpose programs.   

$250 million cash inflow benefit related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 50% bonus depreciation provision.  

51 

Table of Contents  

$192 million cash inflow benefit related to the change in its tax accounting method for certain repair costs incurred on SCE's transmission, distribution and generation assets.   

Higher cash inflow due to the increase in pre-tax income primarily driven by higher authorized revenue requirements resulting from the implementation of the 2009 CPUC and FERC GRC decisions.   

Timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to working capital items.  

 Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities 

Cash provided (used) by financing activities mainly consisted of net repayments of short-term debt and long-term debt issuances (payments).  

Cash provided by financing activities for 2010 was $503 million consisting of the following significant events:   

Issued $1 billion of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2040 to fund SCE's capital program.   

Reissued $144 million of tax-exempt pollution control bonds due in 2035 to fund SCE's capital program.   

Repaid $250 million of senior unsecured notes.   

Paid $300 million in dividends to Edison International.  

Cash used by financing activities for 2009 was $2.0 billion consisting of the following significant events:   

Issued $500 million of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2039 and $250 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2014. The bond proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to finance fuel inventories.   

Repaid a net $1.9 billion of short-term debt.   

Repaid $150 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds.   

Purchased $219 million of two issues of tax-exempt pollution control bonds and converted the issues to a variable rate structure. As discussed above, SCE reissued $144 million of these bonds in 2010. SCE continues to hold the remaining $75 million of these bonds which are outstanding and have not been retired or cancelled.   

Paid $300 million in dividends to Edison International.  

Cash provided by financing activities for 2008 was $2.0 billion consisting of the following significant events:   

Borrowed $1.4 billion under the line of credit to increase SCE's cash position to meet working capital requirements, if needed, during uncertainty over economic conditions during the second half of 2008.   

Issued $600 million of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2038. The proceeds were used to repay SCE's outstanding commercial paper of approximately $426 million and for general corporate purposes.   

Issued $500 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2014. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.   

Issued $400 million of 5.50% first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2018. The proceeds were used to repay SCE's outstanding commercial paper of approximately $110 million and borrowings under the credit facility of $200 million, as well as for general corporate purposes.   

Paid $325 million in dividends to Edison International.  

52 

Table of Contents  

Purchased $212 million of its auction rate bonds, converted the issue to a variable rate structure, and terminated the FGIC insurance policy. SCE continues to hold the bonds which remain outstanding and have not been retired or cancelled.   

Paid $36 million for the purchase and delivery of outstanding common stock for settlement of stock based awards (facilitated by a third party).  

 Net Cash Used by Investing Activities 

Cash flows from investing activities are driven primarily by capital expenditures and funding of nuclear decommissioning trusts. Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.3 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily related to transmission and distribution investments. Net purchases of nuclear decommissioning trust investments and other were $219 million, $199 million and $7 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 Contractual Obligations and Contingencies  

 Contractual Obligations  

SCE's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, for the years 2011 through 2015 and thereafter are estimated below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." Amount includes interest payments totaling $8 billion over applicable period of the debt. 

2Some of the power purchase agreements entered into with independent power producers are treated as operating leases and capital leases. At December 31, 2010, minimum operating lease payments for power purchase agreements were $740 million in 2011, $717 million in 2012, $761 million in 2013, $708 million in 2014, $693 million in 2015, and $8.7 billion for the thereafter period. At December 31, 2010, minimum capital lease payments for power purchase agreements were $33 million in 2011, $71 million 2012, $131 million for 2013, $153 million for 2014, $154 million for 2015, and $2.5 billion for the thereafter period (amounts include executory costs and interest of $628 million and $1.2 billion, respectively). For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

3At December 31, 2010, minimum other operating lease payments were primarily related to vehicles, office space and other equipment. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

4For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

5Amount includes estimated contributions to the pension and PBOP plans. These amounts represent estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change. The estimated contributions for SCE are not available beyond 2014. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 8. Compensation and Benefit Plans" for further information. 

6At December 31, 2010, SCE had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $335 million, which is excluded from the table. SCE cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the IRS. 

7The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," respectively.

Table of Contents 

 Contingencies  

SCE has contingencies related to FERC Rate Case, the Navajo Nation Litigation, nuclear insurance and spent nuclear fuel, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies."  

 Environmental Remediation  

SCE records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and/or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated. SCE reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly, by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. These estimates include costs for site investigations, remediation, operations and maintenance, monitoring and site closure. Unless there is a probable amount, SCE records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs (classified as "Other long-term liabilities") at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain.  

As of December 31, 2010, SCE identified 23 sites for remediation and recorded an estimated minimum liability of $50 million. SCE expects to recover 90% of its remediation costs at certain sites. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion.  

 MARKET RISK EXPOSURES  

SCE's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and volumes, and counterparty credit. Fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows. Fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows, but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms. SCE uses derivative instruments, as appropriate, to manage its market risks.  

 Interest Rate Risk  

SCE is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short-term investing activities used for liquidity purposes, to fund business operations and to fund capital investments. The nature and amount of SCE's long-term and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. SCE's authorized return on common equity was 11.5% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and has been authorized to remain at 11.5% through December 2012 absent any future potential annual adjustment. SCE's authorized return on common equity is established in a multi-year cost of capital mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments if certain thresholds are reached. Variances in actual financing costs compared to authorized financing costs impact earnings either positively or negatively.  

At December 31, 2010, the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) was $8.3 billion, compared to a carrying value of $7.6 billion. A 10% increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a $404 million decrease in the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt. A 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a $444 million increase in the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt.  

 Commodity Price Risk  

SCE is exposed to commodity price risk which represents the potential impact that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular commodity. SCE's hedging program reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices related to SCE's power and gas activities. SCE expects recovery of its related hedging costs through the ERRA balancing account, and as a result, exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings, but may impact the timing of cash flows.  

SCE's hedging program reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices. As part of this program, SCE enters into energy options, swaps, forward arrangements, tolling arrangements, and congestion revenue rights ("CRRs"). The transactions are pre-approved by the CPUC or executed in compliance with CPUC-approved procurement plans. For further discussion on derivative instruments entered into to

mitigate commodity price exposures, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  

 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments  

SCE records its derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless they meet the definition of a normal purchase or sale exception. Derivative instrument fair values are marked to market at each reporting period. Any fair value changes are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and, therefore, SCE's fair value changes have no impact on purchased-power expense or earnings. SCE does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment. For further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value Measurements."  

The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used at SCE to mitigate its exposure to commodity price risk was a net liability of $207 million and $251 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2010, if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Credit Risk  

For information related to credit risks and how SCE manages credit risk, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  

Credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets (derivative assets less derivative liabilities) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. SCE enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff. Accordingly, SCE's credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements. SCE manages the credit risk on the portfolio for both rated and non-rated counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings, and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above broken down by the credit ratings of SCE's counterparties, was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1SCE assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty's S&P or Moody's rating. For ease of reference, the above table uses the S&P classifications to summarize risk, but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings. 

2Exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchases and sales and non-derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets, except for any related net accounts receivable.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table is a summary of EMG's results of operations. Effective January 1, 2010, Edison International combined the competitive power generation and financial services segments into one business segment. The change resulted from termination of cross-border leases during 2009 and the continued reduction of the remaining portfolio of the financial services segment. Accordingly, the financial services segment has been combined retroactively for all periods presented into the competitive power generation business segment. The combination of these business activities is consistent with the management structure of EMG and evaluation of performance by Edison International.  

 Results of Continuing Operations 

This section discusses operating results for 2010, 2009 and 2008. EMG's continuing operations include the fossil-fueled facilities, renewable energy and gas-fired projects, energy trading, and gas-fired projects under contract, corporate interest expense and general and administrative expenses. EMG's discontinued operations include all of its former international operations, except the Doga project.  

The following table is a summary of competitive power generation results of operations for the periods indicated.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2Includes termination of Edison Capital's cross-border leases and state tax impact of Global Settlement with the IRS.   

57 

Table of Contents 

EMG's 2010 core earnings were lower than 2009 core earnings primarily due to the following pre-tax items:   

$108 million decreased income from Midwest Generation and Homer City primarily as a result of unrealized losses in 2010 compared to unrealized gains in 2009 related to hedge contracts, and higher plant maintenance costs in 2010, partially offset by higher capacity revenues and a $24 million gain on the sale of bankruptcy claims against Lehman Brothers. Energy and fuel related unrealized losses in 2010 were $33 million compared to unrealized gains of $60 million in 2009. Results in 2010 included the benefit of power hedge contracts entered into during earlier periods at higher prices than current energy prices. For additional information about market conditions, see "EMG: Market Risk Exposures."   

$33 million gain in the second quarter of 2009 from the sale of an interest in a leverage lease (Midlands Cogeneration Ventures).  

The decrease was offset by the following pre-tax items:   

$61 million increased energy trading revenues due to congestion and power trading.   

$34 million decreased interest expense, net of interest income, primarily due to the increase in the capitalization of interest on projects under construction.   

$25 million decreased corporate expenses due primarily to lower renewable energy development expenses.   

$13 million increased income from distributions received from the March Point and Doga projects.  

In addition to the preceding pre-tax items, core earnings in 2010 were lower due to $15 million of increased tax expenses that resulted from the recapture of Section 199 deductions realized in prior years resulting from the carryback of net operating tax losses.  

 Consolidated non-core items for EMG included: 

An earnings benefit of $52 million in 2010 related to the acceptance by the California Franchise Tax Board of the tax positions finalized with the IRS in 2009 as part of the Global Settlement and a revision to interest on federal disputed tax items.   

An after-tax loss of $610 million recorded in 2009 ($920 million pre-tax) resulting from the Global Settlement with the IRS and termination of Edison Capital's cross-border leases.   

An after-tax earnings charge of $24 million ($40 million pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 resulting from the write-off of capitalized engineering and other costs for air emissions control technology that is not currently being pursued for use at the Powerton Station. These activities were previously suspended as Midwest Generation pursued testing and evaluation of the use of a dry sorbent injection system using Trona or similar sorbents, which is expected to require lower capital costs. The Illinois EPA recently issued a construction permit to authorize installation of a dry sorbent injection system, which Midwest Generation currently expects to use if this project is undertaken. For further discussion, see "Edison International OverviewEnvironmental DevelopmentsMidwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs."  

 Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) ("AOI")Overview 

The following section and table provide a summary of results of EMG's operating projects and corporate expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2010, together with discussions of the contributions by specific projects and of other significant factors affecting these results.  

58 

Table of Contents 

The following table shows the adjusted operating income of EMG's projects:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Sold in 2010. 

2AOI is equal to operating income (loss) under GAAP, plus equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expenses, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Production tax credits are recognized as wind energy is generated based on a per-kilowatt-hour rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. AOI is a non-GAAP performance measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expenses, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in AOI is meaningful for investors as these components are integral to the operating results of EMG.   

The following table reconciles AOI to operating income as reflected on EMG's consolidated statements of income:

 Adjusted Operating Income from Consolidated Operations  

 Midwest Generation Plants  

The following table presents additional data for the Midwest Generation plants:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Included in fuel costs were $13 million, $63 million and $5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the net cost of emission allowances. Transfers of emission allowances between Midwest Generation and Homer City are made at fair market value. Transfers of NOX emission allowances to Midwest Generation were $0.4 million and $1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no NOx transfers in 2008. Transfers of SO2 emission allowances from Midwest Generation were $5 million and $2 million in 2010 and 2008, respectively. There were no SO2 transfers in 2009. For more information regarding the price of emission allowances, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price RiskEmission Allowances Price Risk."   

AOI from the Midwest Generation plants decreased $76 million in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased $348 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Excluding the $40 million pre-tax charge related to the Powerton Station, the 2010 decrease in AOI was primarily attributable to unrealized losses in 2010 compared to unrealized gains in 2009 related to hedge contracts and an increase in plant maintenance costs, partially offset by higher capacity revenues, a gain from the sale of the bankruptcy claims against Lehman Brothers, and lower average realized fuel costs. Plant maintenance and overhaul related expenses were higher in 2010 due to the deferral of plant outages in 2009. Average realized fuel costs per megawatt-hour were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to lower emission allowance costs partially offset by higher costs for activated carbon, which is used to reduce mercury emissions.  

The 2009 decrease in AOI as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower realized energy prices and higher average realized fuel costs, partially offset by higher capacity revenues, unrealized gains in 2009 compared to unrealized losses in 2008 related to hedge contracts, and lower plant operations expense. The 2009 increase in average realized fuel costs was due to higher emission allowance costs to comply with the CAIR annual NOx emission program that began in 2009 and higher costs for activated carbon to implement new mercury emission controls. The 2009 decline in plant operations expense was due to cost containment efforts and the deferral of plant overhaul activities.  

Included in operating revenues were unrealized gains (losses) of $(6) million, $30 million and $(6) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Unrealized gains (losses) in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to economic hedge contracts that are accounted for at fair value with offsetting changes recorded on the consolidated statements of income. In addition, $10 million and $14 million were reversed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the power contracts with Lehman Brothers. Unrealized losses in 2008 included a $24 million write-down of  

60 

Table of Contents 

power contracts with Lehman Brothers for 2009 and 2010 forecasted generation. These contracts qualified as cash flow hedges until EMG dedesignated the contracts due to nonperformance risk and subsequently terminated the contracts. The change in fair value was recorded as an unrealized loss during 2008. In addition, unrealized gains (losses) included the ineffective portion of hedge contracts at the Midwest Generation plants attributable to changes in the difference between energy prices at the Northern Illinois Hub (the settlement point under forward contracts) and the energy prices at the Midwest Generation plants' busbars (the delivery point where power generated by the Midwest Generation plants is delivered into the transmission system) resulting from marginal losses.  

Included in fuel costs were unrealized gains (losses) of $(7) million and $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to oil futures contracts that were accounted for as economic hedges. These contracts were entered into in 2010 and 2009 to hedge variable fuel oil components of rail transportation costs.  

 Homer City  

The following table presents additional data for the Homer City plant:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Included in fuel costs were $7 million, $16 million and $20 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the net cost of emission allowances. Transfers of emission allowances between Midwest Generation and Homer City are made at fair market value. Transfers of SO2 emission allowances to Homer City were $5 million and $2 million in 2010 and 2008, respectively. There were no SO2 transfers in 2009. Transfers of NOx emission allowances from Homer City were $0.4 million and $1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no NOx transfers in 2008. For more information regarding the price of emission allowances, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price RiskEmission Allowances Price Risk."   

On February 10, 2011, a steam pipe ruptured at Unit 1 of the Homer City plant, taking the unit off line. As a precautionary measure, Homer City has taken Unit 2 (which has the same design) off line in order to further evaluate the equipment and perform any necessary corrective work. Work has commenced to inspect the piping that failed and planning activities to install replacement piping on both units are underway. Homer City is in the process of modifying its scheduled maintenance plans to incorporate this outage. It is expected that both units will return to service during the second quarter of 2011.  

AOI from the Homer City plant decreased $72 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased $16 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2010 decrease in AOI was primarily attributable to unrealized losses in 2010 compared to unrealized gains in 2009 related to hedge contracts, higher coal costs, lower generation, and higher plant operations costs related to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by an increase in capacity revenues. The Homer City plant experienced increased forced outages in 2010 compared to 2009 due to deratings to comply with opacity restrictions and unscheduled outages. Plant maintenance and overhaul related expenses were higher in 2010 due to the deferral of plant outages in 2009. Coal costs increased due to higher coal prices and changes in the mix of ready-to-burn coal and raw coal consumed.  

61 

Table of Contents 

The 2009 decrease in AOI as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower realized energy prices, partially offset by an increase in capacity revenues, lower plant operations expense and lower coal costs. The decline in plant operations expense was attributable to cost containment efforts and the deferral of plant overhaul activities.  

Included in operating revenues were unrealized gains (losses) from hedge activities of $(20) million, $15 million and $21 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Unrealized gains (losses) were primarily attributable to the ineffective portion of forward and futures contracts which are derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges. The ineffective portion of hedge contracts at Homer City was attributable to changes in the difference between energy prices at PJM West Hub (the settlement point under forward contracts) and the energy prices at the Homer City busbar (the delivery point where power generated by the Homer City plant is delivered into the transmission system).  

 Renewable Energy Projects  

The following table presents additional data for EMG's renewable energy projects:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1AOI is equal to operating income (loss) plus equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates, production tax credits, other income and expense, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Production tax credits are recognized as wind energy is generated based upon a per-kilowatt-hour rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Under GAAP, production tax credits generated by wind projects are recorded as a reduction in income taxes. Accordingly, AOI represents a non-GAAP performance measure which may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of production tax credits in AOI for wind projects is meaningful for investors as federal and state subsidies are an integral part of the economics of these projects. 

2Includes renewable energy projects that are unconsolidated at EMG. Generation excluding unconsolidated projects was 3,037 GWh in 2010 and 2,514 GWh in 2009.   

AOI from renewable energy projects decreased $2 million in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased $7 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2010 decrease was primarily due to the impairment of a Minnesota Wind project and an increase in costs related to projects under construction. The 2009 decrease in AOI was primarily attributable to mild wind conditions, which reduced the revenue increases relative to the increased operating costs associated with additional projects coming on line. Expenses incurred for projects under construction also contributed to the decrease in AOI. EMG's share of installed capacity of new wind projects that commenced operations during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 150 MW, 223 MW and 396 MW, respectively.  

AOI in 2010, 2009 and 2008 included payments from Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation for availability losses of $2 million, $17 million and $28 million, respectively. Payments under the availability guarantee are designed to compensate EMG for lost earnings, including production tax credits. Accordingly, the payments  

62 

Table of Contents 

under the availability guarantee are paid on a pre-tax basis which affects period-to-period comparisons that include production tax credits which are after tax.  

 Energy Trading 

EMG seeks to generate profit by utilizing its subsidiary, EMMT, to engage in trading activities primarily in those markets in which it is active as a result of its management of the merchant power plants of Midwest Generation and Homer City. EMMT trades power, fuel, coal, and transmission congestion primarily in the eastern U.S. power grid using products available over the counter, through exchanges, and from ISOs.  

AOI from energy trading activities increased $61 million in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased $115 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2010 increase in AOI energy trading activities was attributable to increased revenues in congestion and power trading. Congestion trading results increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to unseasonable cold weather and transmission outages in the New York and PJM markets. The 2009 decrease in AOI from energy trading activities was attributable to lower transmission congestion in the eastern U.S. power grid. In addition, energy trading included favorable results for load service transactions in 2009.  

 Adjusted Operating Income from Leveraged Lease Activities and Lease Terminations and Other  

AOI from leveraged lease income in 2009 included a $920 million loss on termination of the cross-border leases, partially offset by a $33 million gain on the sale of an interest in a leveraged lease (Midlands Cogeneration Ventures). Leveraged lease income declined in 2010 and 2009 from 2008 primarily due to termination of the cross-border leases.  

 Other Operating Income (Expense)  

Other operating income (expense) in 2008 resulted from a charge of $23 million related to the termination of a turbine supply agreement in connection with the Walnut Creek project and a $7 million write-down of capitalized costs related to development projects. These amounts are reflected in "Lease terminations and other" on the consolidated statements of income.  

 Corporate Administrative and General Expenses  

Corporate administrative and general expenses decreased $25 million in 2010 from 2009 and decreased $7 million in 2009 from 2008. The 2010 and 2009 decreases were primarily attributable to lower development costs related to renewable energy. In April 2009, EMG reduced approximately 75 positions in its regional and corporate offices.  

 Interest Income (Expense)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower average cash balances.  

EMG's interest expense decreased $42 million in 2010 from 2009 and increased $18 million in 2009 from 2008. The 2010 decrease in interest expense was primarily due to higher capitalized interest and lower debt balances under EME's and Midwest Generation's credit facilities, partially offset by higher wind project financing. The 2009 increase was primarily due to higher debt balances under EME's credit facility in 2009, compared to 2008, and EME's wind financing in June 2009. Capitalized interest was $54 million,  

63 

Table of Contents 

$19 million and $32 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 increase was the result of increased interest capitalization for projects under construction. The change in capitalized interest during these periods relates to the increase or decrease in renewable projects under construction.  

 Income Taxes  

The table below provides an analysis of the principal factors impacting EMG's effective tax rate:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

EMG's effective tax rate for 2010 was impacted by the Global Settlement and the recapture of qualified production deductions realized in prior years resulting from a carryback of net operating losses to 2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by lower pretax income in relation to the level of production tax credits and estimated state income tax benefits allocated from Edison International. Estimated state income tax benefits allocated from Edison International of $7 million, $15 million and $5 million were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 7. Income Taxes."  

 Results of Discontinued Operations  

The 2010 results of discontinued operations included foreign exchange gains and interest expense on contract indemnities denominated in euros, adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits, and expiration in 2010 of another contract indemnity. The contract indemnities relate to the 2004 sale of EMG's international projects in December 2004. Results in 2009 and 2008 included foreign exchange gains (losses), change in estimates, and interest expense also associated with these contract indemnities.  

 Related-Party Transactions  

EMG owns interests in partnerships that sell electricity generated by their project facilities to SCE and others under the terms of power purchase agreements. Sales by these partnerships to SCE under these agreements amounted to $367 million, $366 million and $686 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 Available Liquidity  

The following table summarizes available liquidity at December 31, 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Cash and cash equivalents are available to meet Midwest Generation's operating and capital expenditure requirements.   

Because EME, as a holding company, does not directly own any revenue-producing generation facilities, EME relies on cash distributions and tax payments from its projects to meet its obligations, including debt service obligations on long-term debt. The timing and amount of distributions from EME's subsidiaries may be restricted. For further details, see "Debt Covenants and Dividend RestrictionsDividend Restrictions in Major Financings."  

The following table summarizes the status of the EME and Midwest Generation credit facilities at December 31, 2010, which mature in June 2012:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

EME and Midwest Generation may seek to extend or replace credit facilities or retire them by other means. The terms and conditions of any refinancing could be substantially different than those in the current credit facilities. Senior notes in the principal amount of $500 million, which were issued in 2006 and which bear interest at 7.50% per annum, are due in June 2013. EME may also from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchange offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on prevailing market conditions, EME's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  

Midwest Generation has not yet committed to the completion of environmental compliance activities for all of its plants. Expenditures for NOx and SO2 controls through 2013 are estimated at $481 million based on an assumption that Midwest Generation would retrofit all units over the compliance period, which extends to 2018. Depending upon the facilities selected to be retrofitted, the cost of such retrofitting, and the timing of funding requirements beyond the near term, Midwest Generation may utilize operating cash flow, draw on its credit facilities, when available, or seek debt financing to fund capital expenditures.  

65 

 Table of Contents  

Capital expenditures to complete renewable energy projects through 2011 are projected to be $279 million at December 31, 2010. EMG anticipates that capital investment for renewable energy projects under or pending construction will be funded using a combination of construction and term financings, U.S. Treasury grants and third-party capital. EMG has available secured project financing of $48 million. In addition, U.S. Treasury grants of $346 million are anticipated based on estimated eligible construction costs for renewable projects completed in 2010 and scheduled to be completed in 2011.  

Edison International's utilization of net operating losses and production tax credits from EMG in its consolidated return impacts EMG's liquidity. The bonus depreciation extension enacted in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the 2010 Tax Relief Act is expected to result in delays in EMG's receipt of future tax-allocation payments. For more information, see "EMG: Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIntercompany Tax-Allocation Agreement," "Edison International OverviewBonus Depreciation Impact on Edison International" and "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to EMGLiquidity Risks."  

 Capital Investment Plan  

At December 31, 2010, forecasted capital expenditures through 2013 by EMG's subsidiaries for existing projects, corporate activities and turbine commitments were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Environmental Capital Expenditures  

Midwest Generation plants' environmental expenditures include $109 million for expenditures in 2011 related to SNCR equipment and $372 million for expenditures in 2011 to 2013 to begin to retrofit initial units using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents to comply with CPS requirements for SO2 emissions. Midwest Generation could elect to shut down units instead of installing controls to be in compliance with the CPS, and, therefore, decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ to comply remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made. Accordingly, the environmental expenditures for Midwest Generation in the preceding table represent current projects only and are subject to change based upon a number of considerations. Actual expenditures could be higher or lower. Preconstruction engineering and initial construction work may occur in 2011 in advance of a final decision to continue or complete the project. For additional discussion, see "Edison International OverviewEnvironmental DevelopmentsMidwest Generation Compliance Plans and Costs."  

The capital investment plan set forth in the previous table does not include environmental capital expenditures for Homer City. However, depending on upcoming and future regulatory developments, Homer City may be required to undertake capital projects to install additional pollution control equipment which will be dependent on lessor decisions regarding the funding of these expenditures. For a discussion of environmental regulations, see "Edison International OverviewEnvironmental DevelopmentsHomer City Environmental Issues and Capital Resource Limitations."  

 Non-Environmental Capital Expenditures  

Plant capital expenditures in the preceding table relate to non-environmental projects such as upgrades to boiler and turbine controls, replacement of major boiler components, generator stator rewinds, condenser  

66 

Table of Contents 

re-tubing, development of a coal-cleaning plant refuse site and a new ash disposal site, and main power transformer replacement.  

Renewable energy projects' capital and construction expenditures include a project of an unconsolidated entity in which construction expenditures will be substantially funded by EMG. Construction project financing of $48 million was available as of December 31, 2010. In addition, U.S. Treasury grants of $346 million are anticipated based on estimated eligible construction costs for renewable projects completed in 2010 and scheduled to be completed in 2011.  

 Future Projects  

At December 31, 2010, EMG had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately 3,600 MW. The development pipeline represents potential projects with respect to which EMG either owns the project rights or has exclusive acquisition rights. Future development of the wind portfolio is dependent on the availability of third-party capital. To the extent that third-party capital is available, the success of development efforts will depend upon, among other things, obtaining permits and agreements necessary to support an investment. This process may take a number of years due to factors that include local permit requirements, willingness of local utilities to purchase renewable power at sufficient prices to earn an appropriate rate of return, and availability and prices of equipment.  

For additional information regarding capital expenditures for turbines and the Walnut Creek project, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and ContingenciesOther Commitments."  

 Historical Segment Cash Flows  

The table below sets forth condensed historical cash flow information for EMG.  

 Condensed Statement of Cash Flows  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Net Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $1.3 billion in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the impacts of the Global Settlement. In April 2010, Edison Capital funded a $253 million deposit to the IRS related to the Global Settlement. In 2009, Edison Capital made a net tax-allocation payment to Edison International of $1.1 billion related to the termination of Edison Capital's interest in cross-border leases (see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Income Taxes" for further discussion). The 2010 increase was also due to higher realized revenue from derivative contracts and payments on U.S. Treasury grants.  

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $1.6 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily attributable to:   

The impacts of the Global Settlement which resulted in net tax-allocation payments to Edison International of $1.1 billion by Edison Capital related to the termination of Edison Capital's interests in cross-border leases.  

67 

Table of Contents  

Lower realized revenues due to lower market prices in 2009, compared to 2008 and a decrease in margin deposits received from counterparties at December 31, 2009.  

 Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities  

Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased $1 billion in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. In 2010, financing activities included project-level financing of renewable energy projects and repayment of credit facilities in 2009. In addition, in January 2010, Edison Capital redeemed in full its $89 million medium-term loans.  

The 2009 increase as compared to 2008 in cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was attributable to repayments of $376 million and $475 million under EME's corporate credit facility and Midwest Generation's working capital facility, respectively. These repayments were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of a $189 million term loan as part of a $202 million project financing completed in June 2009.  

 Net Cash Used by Investing Activities  

Cash used by investing activities from continuing operations decreased $1.6 billion in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The 2010 decrease was primarily due to $1.385 billion of net proceeds from termination of the cross-border leases at Edison Capital in 2009. The change was also due to the construction of wind projects.  

 Credit Ratings  

     Overview 

Credit ratings for EME, Midwest Generation and EMMT as of December 31, 2010 were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Senior unsecured rating. 

2First priority senior secured rating.   

All the above ratings are on negative outlook. EMG cannot provide assurance that its current credit ratings or the credit ratings of its subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered. EMG notes that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold its securities and may be revised at any time by a rating agency.  

EMG does not have any "rating triggers" contained in subsidiary financings that would result in it being required to make equity contributions or provide additional financial support to its subsidiaries, including EMMT. However, coal contracts at Midwest Generation include provisions that provide the right to request additional collateral to support payment obligations for delivered coal and may vary based on Midwest Generation's credit ratings. Furthermore, EMMT also has hedge contracts that do not require margin, but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party.  

 Credit Rating of EMMT 

The Homer City sale-leaseback documents restrict Homer City's ability to enter into derivative activities with EMMT to sell forward the output of the Homer City plant if EMMT does not have an investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody's or, in the absence of those ratings, if it is not rated as investment grade pursuant to EMG's internal credit scoring procedures. These documents also include a requirement that Homer City's counterparty to such transactions, whether it is EMMT or another party, and Homer City, if acting as seller to an unaffiliated third party, be investment grade. EMG currently sells all the output from the Homer City plant through EMMT, which has a below investment grade credit rating, and Homer City is not rated. In order to continue to sell forward the output of the Homer City plant through

Table of Contents 

EMMT, EMG has obtained a consent from the sale-leaseback owner participants that allows Homer City to enter into such sales, under specified conditions, through March 1, 2014. Homer City continues to be in compliance with the terms of the consent; however, because EMMT's credit rating has dropped below BB-, the consent is revocable by the sale-leaseback owner participants at any time. The sale-leaseback owner participants have not indicated that they intend to revoke the consent; however, there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. An additional consequence of EMMT's lowered credit rating is a requirement for EMMT to prepay for Homer City's output to satisfy a requirement under the terms of the consent that outstanding accounts receivable between EMMT and Homer City be reduced to zero. Revocation of the consent would not affect trades between EMMT and Homer City that had been entered into while the consent was still in effect. EMG is permitted to sell the output of the Homer City plant into the spot market on the terms set forth in the Homer City sale-leaseback documents.  

 Margin, Collateral Deposits and Other Credit Support for Energy Contracts 

To reduce its exposure to market risk, EMG hedges a portion of its electricity price exposure through EMMT. In connection with entering into contracts, EMMT may be required to support its risk of nonperformance through parent guarantees, margining or other credit support. EMG has entered into guarantees in support of EMMT's hedging and trading activities; however, EMG has historically also provided collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties related to the net of accounts payable, accounts receivable, unrealized losses, and unrealized gains in connection with these hedging and trading activities. At December 31, 2010, EMMT had deposited $43 million in cash with clearing brokers in support of futures contracts and had deposited $16 million in cash with counterparties in support of forward energy and congestion contracts. Cash collateral provided to others offset against derivative liabilities totaled $4 million at December 31, 2010. In addition, EMG had received cash collateral of $52 million at December 31, 2010 to support credit risk of counterparties under margin agreements. The liability for margin deposits received from counterparties has been offset against net derivative assets.  

Future cash collateral requirements may be higher than the margin and collateral requirements at December 31, 2010, if wholesale energy prices change or if EMMT enters into additional transactions. EMG estimates that margin and collateral requirements for energy and congestion contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2010 could increase by approximately $89 million over the remaining life of the contracts using a 95% confidence level. This increase may not be offset by similar changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items in the same periods. Certain EMMT hedge contracts do not require margin, but contain provisions that require EMG or Midwest Generation to comply with the terms and conditions of their credit facilities. The credit facilities contain financial covenants which are described further in "Dividend Restrictions in Major Financings."  

 Potential Regulation of Swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act may impact margin, capital and collateral requirements in the future. See "Edison International (Consolidated)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesPotential Regulation of Swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act" for further discussion.  

 Intercompany Tax-Allocation Agreement 

EMG and its subsidiaries, EME and Edison Capital, are included in the consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns of Edison International and are eligible to participate in tax-allocation payments with other subsidiaries of Edison International in circumstances where domestic tax losses are incurred. The right of EME and Edison Capital to receive and the amount of and timing of tax-allocation payments are dependent on the inclusion of EME and Edison Capital in the consolidated income tax returns of Edison International and its subsidiaries and other factors, including the consolidated taxable income of Edison International and its subsidiaries, the amount of net operating losses and other tax items of EMG's subsidiaries, and other subsidiaries of Edison International and specific procedures regarding allocation of state taxes. EME and Edison Capital receive tax-allocation payments for tax losses when and to the extent that the consolidated Edison International group generates sufficient taxable income in order to be able to utilize EME's or Edison Capital's consolidated tax losses in the consolidated income tax returns for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Based on the application of the factors cited above, EME and Edison Capital are obligated during periods it generates taxable income to make payments under the tax-allocation agreements. EMG made net tax-allocation payments of $371 million, $1.1 billion and $113 million in 2010,

2009 and 2008, respectively. See "Edison International OverviewHighlights of Operating Results" for information regarding the Global Settlement.  

EME expects to receive tax-allocation payments in 2011 as a result of the carryback of Edison International consolidated net operating losses for 2010 and subsequently make tax-allocation payments in 2012 a result of reallocation of tax obligations from an expected Edison International consolidated net operating loss during 2011. For further information, see "Edison International OverviewBonus Depreciation Impact on Edison International."  

 Debt Covenants and Dividend Restrictions 

     Credit Facility Financial Ratios 

EMG's credit facility contains financial covenants which require EMG to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum corporate-debt-to-capital ratio as such terms are defined in the credit facility. The following table sets forth the interest coverage ratio:

 Dividend Restrictions in Major Financings 

Each of EMG's direct or indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from EMG and its other subsidiaries. Assets of EMG's subsidiaries are not available to satisfy EMG's obligations or the obligations of any of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law and the terms of financing arrangements of the parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to EMG or to its subsidiary holding companies.  

 Key Ratios of EMG's Principal Subsidiaries Affecting Dividends 

Set forth below are key ratios of EMG's principal subsidiaries required by financing arrangements at December 31, 2010 or for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Midwest Generation Financing Restrictions on Distributions 

Midwest Generation is bound by the covenants in its credit agreement and certain covenants under the Powerton-Joliet lease documents with respect to Midwest Generation making payments under the leases. These covenants include restrictions on the ability to, among other things, incur debt, create liens on its property, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, make

Table of Contents 

distributions, make capital expenditures, enter into agreements restricting its ability to make distributions, engage in other lines of business, enter into swap agreements, or engage in transactions for any speculative purpose. In order for Midwest Generation to make a distribution, it must be in compliance with the covenants specified under its credit agreement, including maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.60 to 1.  

 Homer City Sale-Leaseback Restrictions on Distributions 

Homer City completed a sale-leaseback of the Homer City plant in December 2001. In order to make a distribution, Homer City must be in compliance with the covenants specified in the lease agreements, including the following financial performance requirements measured on the date of distribution.  

At the end of each quarter, the equity and debt portions of rent then due and payable must have been paid and the senior rent service coverage ratio for the prior 12-month period (taken as a whole and projected for each of the prospective two 12-month periods) must be greater than 1.7 to 1.  

 EMG's Senior Notes and Guaranty of Powerton-Joliet Leases 

EMG is restricted under applicable agreements from selling or disposing of assets, which includes distributions, if the aggregate net book value of all such sales and dispositions during the most recent 12-month period would exceed 10% of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in such agreements computed as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter preceding the sale or disposition in question. At December 31, 2010, the maximum permissible sale or disposition of EMG assets was $872 million.

For more information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 8. Compensation and Benefit PlansPension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." 

5At December 31, 2010, EMG had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $227 million, which is excluded from the table. EMG cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. For more information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 7. Income Taxes." 

6The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and AROs, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," respectively.   

 Commercial Commitments 

     Standby Letters of Credit 

As of December 31, 2010, standby letters of credit under EMG and its subsidiaries' credit facilities aggregated $116 million and were scheduled to expire as follows: $95 million in 2011, $11 million in 2012, and $10 million in 2017. Certain letters of credit are subject to automatic annual renewal provisions.  

 Contingencies 

EMG's significant contingencies related to the Midwest Generation New Source Review lawsuit and Homer City New Source Review Lawsuit are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies."  

 Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 

EMG has off-balance sheet transactions in three principal areas: investments in projects accounted for under the equity method, operating leases resulting from sale-leaseback transactions and leveraged leases.

Table of Contents 

 Investments Accounted for under the Equity Method 

EMG has a number of investments in power projects that are accounted for under the equity method. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3. Variable Interest Entities."  

Subsidiaries of EMG have invested in affordable housing projects utilizing partnership or limited liability companies in which EMG is a passive investor. With a few exceptions, an unrelated general partner or managing member exercises operating control of these projects and partnerships. The debt of those partnerships and limited liability companies is secured by real property. At December 31, 2010, entities that EMG has accounted for under the equity method had indebtedness of approximately $1.3 billion, of which approximately $451 million is proportionate to EMG's ownership interest in these projects. Substantially all of this debt is nonrecourse to EMG.  

 Sale-Leaseback Transactions 

EMG has entered into sale-leaseback transactions related to the Powerton Station and Units 7 and 8 of the Joliet Station in Illinois and the Homer City plant in Pennsylvania. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and ContingenciesPower Plant and Other Lease Commitments."  

EMG's subsidiaries record depreciation expense from the power plants and interest expense from the lease financing in lieu of an operating lease expense which EMG uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements. The treatment of these leases as operating leases on its consolidated financial statements in lieu of lease financings, which are recorded by EMG's subsidiaries, resulted in an increase in consolidated net income of $36 million, $35 million and $46 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

The lessor equity and lessor debt associated with the sale-leaseback transactions for the Powerton, Joliet and Homer City assets are summarized in the following table:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The operating lease payments to be made by each of EMG's subsidiary lessees are structured to service the lessor debt and provide a return to the owner-lessor's equity investors. Neither the value of the leased assets nor the lessor debt is reflected on EMG's consolidated balance sheet.  

 Leveraged Leases 

Subsidiaries of EMG are lessors in power and infrastructure projects with terms of 25 to 30 years. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 15. Other Investments" for details of the lease investments.

 MARKET RISK EXPOSURES 

     Introduction 

EMG's primary market risk exposures are associated with the sale of electricity and capacity from, and the procurement of fuel for, its merchant power plants. These market risks arise from price fluctuations of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. Additionally, EMG's financial results can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates. EMG manages these risks in part by using derivative instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures.  

 Derivative Instruments 

EMG uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from price fluctuations of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. For derivative instruments recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings at the end of each accounting period unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. For derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, changes in their fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item settles and is recognized in earnings. However, the ineffective portion of a derivative that qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting is recognized currently in earnings.  

 Unrealized Gains and Losses 

EMG classifies unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments (other than the effective portion of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting) as part of operating revenues or fuel costs. The results of derivative activities are recorded as part of cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table summarizes unrealized gains (losses) from non-trading activities:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

At December 31, 2010, cumulative unrealized gains of $4 million were recognized from non-qualifying hedge contracts or the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges related to 2011.  

 Fair Value Disclosures 

In determining the fair value of EMG's derivative positions, EMG uses third-party market pricing where available. For further explanation of the fair value hierarchy and a discussion of EMG's derivative instruments, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Fair Value Measurements" and "Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," respectively.  

The fair value of derivatives used for non-trading purposes at December 31, 2010 was $46 million. A 10% change in the market price of the underlying commodity at December 31, 2010 would increase or decrease the fair value of outstanding non-trading commodity derivative instruments by approximately $58 million.  

The fair value of derivatives used for trading purposes at December 31, 2010 was $110 million. A 10% change in the market price of the underlying commodity at December 31, 2010 would increase or decrease the fair value of trading contracts by approximately $26 million. The impact of changes to the various inputs used to determine the fair value of Level 3 derivatives would not be anticipated to be material to EMG's results of operations as such changes would be offset by similar changes in derivatives classified within Level 3 as well as other levels. Level 3 assets and liabilities are 58% and 34%, respectively, of assets  

74 

Table of Contents 

and liabilities measured at fair value before the impact of offsetting collateral and netting as of December 31, 2010.  

 Commodity Price Risk 

     Introduction 

EMG's merchant operations create exposure to commodity price risk, which reflects the potential impact of a change in the market value of a particular commodity. Commodity price risks are actively monitored, with oversight provided by a risk management committee, to ensure compliance with EMG's risk management policies. Despite this, there can be no assurance that all risks have been accurately identified, measured and/or mitigated.  

 Energy Price Risk Affecting Sales from the Coal Plants 

Energy and capacity from the coal plants are sold under terms, including price, duration and quantity, arranged by EMMT with customers through a combination of bilateral agreements (resulting from negotiations or from auctions), forward energy sales and spot market sales. Power is sold into PJM at spot prices based upon locational marginal pricing. Hedging transactions related to generation are generally entered into at the Northern Illinois Hub, and to a lesser extent, the AEP/Dayton Hub, both in PJM, for the Midwest Generation plants and generally at the PJM West Hub for the Homer City plant.  

The following table depicts the average historical market prices for energy per megawatt-hour at the locations indicated:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Energy prices were calculated at the respective delivery points using historical hourly real-time prices as published by PJM or provided on the PJM web-site.   

The following table sets forth the forward market prices for energy per megawatt-hour as quoted for sales into the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub at December 31, 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Energy prices were determined by obtaining broker quotes and information from other public sources relating to the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub delivery points. 

2Market price for energy purchases for the entire calendar year.   

Forward market prices at the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including natural gas prices, transmission congestion, changes in market rules, electricity demand (which in turn is affected by weather, economic growth, and other factors), plant outages in the region, and the amount of existing and planned power plant capacity. The actual spot prices for electricity delivered by the coal plants into these markets may vary materially from the forward market prices set forth in the preceding table.  

EMMT engages in hedging activities for the coal plants to hedge the risk of future change in the price of electricity. The following table summarizes the hedge positions (including load requirements services  

75 

Table of Contents 

contracts and forward contracts accounted for on the accrual basis) as of December 31, 2010 for electricity expected to be generated in 2011 and 2012:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day. Market prices tend to be higher during on-peak periods and during summer months, although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time. Accordingly, the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the 24-hour Northern Illinois Hub or PJM West Hub prices set forth above. 

2Includes hedging transactions primarily at the PJM West Hub and to a lesser extent at other trading locations. Years 2011 and 2012 include hedging activities entered into by EMMT for the Homer City plant that are not designated under the intercompany agreements with Homer City due to limitations under the sale leaseback transaction documents. 

3The average price/MWh includes 72 to 84 MW for periods ranging from January 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012 at Homer City sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts.   

 Capacity Price Risk 

Under the RPM, capacity commitments are made in advance to provide a long-term pricing signal for capacity resources. The RPM is intended to provide a mechanism for PJM to meet the region's need for generation capacity, while allocating the cost to load-serving entities through a locational reliability charge.  

76 

Table of Contents 

The following table summarizes the status of capacity sales for Midwest Generation and Homer City at December 31, 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Capacity not sold arises from: (i) capacity retained to meet forced outages under the RPM auction guidelines, and (ii) capacity that PJM does not purchase at the clearing price resulting from the RPM auction. 

2Excludes 72 to 84 MW of capacity for periods ranging from January 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012 at Homer City sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts. 

3Other capacity sales and purchases, net includes contracts executed in advance of the RPM base residual auction to hedge the price risk related to such auction, participation in RPM incremental auctions and other capacity transactions entered into to manage capacity risks. 

4Includes the impact of a 100 MW capacity swap transaction executed prior to the base residual auction at $135 per MW-day.   

The RPM auction capacity prices for the delivery period of June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 and June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014 varied between different areas of PJM. In the western portion of PJM, affecting Midwest Generation, the prices of $16.46 per MW-day and $27.73 per MW-day were substantially lower than other areas' capacity prices. The impact of lower capacity prices for these periods compared to previous years will have an adverse effect on Midwest Generation's revenues unless such lower capacity prices are offset by an unavailability of competing resources and increased energy prices.  

Revenues from the sale of capacity from Midwest Generation and Homer City beyond the periods set forth above will depend upon the amount of capacity available and future market prices either in PJM or nearby markets if EMG has an opportunity to capture a higher value associated with those markets. Under PJM's RPM system, the market price for capacity is generally determined by aggregate market-based supply conditions and an administratively set aggregate demand curve. Among the factors influencing the supply of capacity in any particular market are plant forced outage rates, plant closings, plant delistings (due to plants being removed as capacity resources and/or to export capacity to other markets), capacity imports from other markets, demand side management activities and the cost of new entry.  

 Basis Risk 

Sales made from the coal plants in the real-time or day-ahead market receive the actual spot prices or day-ahead prices, as the case may be, at the busbars (delivery points) of the individual plants. In order to mitigate price risk from changes in spot prices at the individual plant busbars, EMG may enter into cash settled futures contracts as well as forward contracts with counterparties for energy to be delivered in future periods. Currently, a liquid market for entering into these contracts at the individual plant busbars does not exist. A liquid market does exist for a settlement point at the PJM West Hub in the case of the Homer City plant and for settlement points at the Northern Illinois Hub and the AEP/Dayton Hub in the case of the Midwest Generation plants. EMG's hedging activities use these settlement points (and, to a lesser extent, other similar trading hubs) to enter into hedging contracts. To the extent that, on the settlement date of a hedge contract, spot prices at the relevant busbar are lower than spot prices at the settlement point, the proceeds actually realized from the related hedge contract are effectively reduced by  

77 

Table of Contents 

the difference. This is referred to as "basis risk." During 2010, transmission congestion in PJM resulted in prices at the Homer City busbar being lower than those at the PJM West Hub by an average of 14%, compared to 9% during 2009 and 16% during 2008. During 2010, transmission congestion in PJM resulted in prices at the individual busbars of the Midwest Generation plants being lower than those at the AEP/Dayton Hub and Northern Illinois Hub by an average of 13% and 1%, respectively, compared to 14% and 1%, respectively, during 2009.  

By entering into cash settled futures contracts and forward contracts using the PJM West Hub, the Northern Illinois Hub, and the AEP/Dayton Hub (or other similar trading hubs) as settlement points, EMG is exposed to basis risk as described above. In order to mitigate basis risk, EMG may purchase financial transmission rights and basis swaps in PJM for Homer City and Midwest Generation. A financial transmission right is a financial instrument that entitles the holder to receive the difference between actual spot prices for two delivery points in exchange for a fixed amount. Accordingly, EMG's hedging activities include using financial transmission rights alone or in combination with forward contracts and basis swap contracts to manage basis risk.  

 Coal and Transportation Price Risk 

The Midwest Generation plants and Homer City plant purchase coal primarily from the Southern PRB of Wyoming and from mines located near the facilities in Pennsylvania, respectively. Coal purchases are made under a variety of supply agreements. The following table summarizes the amount of coal under contract at December 31, 2010 for the following three years:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The amount of coal under contract in equivalent tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an 8,800 Btu equivalent for the Midwest Generation plants and 13,000 Btu equivalent for the Homer City plant. 

2In January 2011, Midwest Generation entered into additional contractual agreements for the purchase of 1.25 million tons for 2011.   

EMG is subject to price risk for purchases of coal that are not under contract. Prices of NAPP coal, which are related to the price of coal purchased for the Homer City plant, increased during 2010 from 2009 and decreased during 2009 from 2008. The market price of NAPP coal (with 13,000 Btu per pound heat content and <3.0 pounds of SO2 per MMBtu sulfur content) increased to a price of $70 per ton at December 31, 2010, compared to a price of $52.50 per ton at December 31, 2009, as reported by the EIA. In 2010, the price of NAPP coal ranged from $54 per ton to $71 per ton, as reported by the EIA. The 2010 increase in NAPP coal prices was primarily driven by the export market demand and global coal pricing.  

Prices of PRB coal (with 8,800 Btu per pound heat content and 0.8 pounds of SO2 per MMBtu sulfur content) purchased for the Midwest Generation plants increased during 2010 from 2009 year-end prices and declined during 2009 from 2008 year-end prices. The price of PRB coal fluctuated between $9.80 per ton and $15.35 per ton during 2010, with a price of $13.60 per ton at December 31, 2010, compared to a price of $9.25 per ton at December 31, 2009, as reported by the EIA. The 2010 increase in PRB coal prices was due to the draw down of inventory levels and flat to slight declines of PRB coal production.  

EMG has contracts for the transport of coal to its facilities. The primary contract is with Union Pacific Railroad (and various short-haul carriers), which extends through 2011. EMG is exposed to price risk related to transportation rates after the expiration of its existing transportation contracts. Current market transportation rates for PRB coal are higher than the existing rates under contract. Transportation costs are approximately half of the delivered cost of PRB coal to the Midwest Generation plants.  

Based on EMG's anticipated coal requirements in 2011 in excess of the amount under contract, EMG expects that a 10% change in the price of coal at December 31, 2010 would increase or decrease pre-tax income in 2011 by approximately $6 million.  

78 

Table of Contents 

 Emission Allowances Price Risk 

The federal Acid Rain Program requires electric generating stations to hold SO2 allowances sufficient to cover their annual emissions. Pursuant to Pennsylvania's and Illinois' implementation of the CAIR, the coal plants are required to hold seasonal and annual NOx allowances.  

In the event that actual emissions required are greater than allowances held, EMG is subject to price risk for purchases of emission allowances. The market price for emission allowances may vary significantly. The average purchase price of SO2 allowances was $50 per ton in 2010, $65 per ton in 2009 and $315 per ton in 2008. The average purchase price of annual NOx allowances was $936 per ton in 2010 and $1,431 per ton in 2009. Based on broker's quotes and information from public sources, the spot price for SO2 allowances and annual NOx allowances was $9 per ton and $320 per ton, respectively, at December 31, 2010.  

Based on EMG's anticipated SO2 requirements and annual and seasonal NOx requirements for 2011 beyond those allowances already purchased, EMG expects that a 10% change in the price of SO2 emission allowances and annual and seasonal NOx emission allowances at December 31, 2010 would increase or decrease pre-tax income in 2011 by approximately $0.5 million.  

 Credit Risk 

For further information related to credit risk and how EMG manages credit risk, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  

The credit risk exposure from counterparties of merchant energy hedging and trading activities is measured as the sum of net receivables (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets. EMG's subsidiaries enter into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting such activities which typically provide for a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty. At December 31, 2010, the balance sheet exposure as described above, broken down by the credit ratings of EMG's counterparties, was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1EMG assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty's S&P or Moody's rating. For ease of reference, the above table uses the S&P classifications to summarize risk, but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings. 

2Exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non-derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, except for any related accounts receivable.   

The credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is comprised of $149 million of net accounts receivable and payables and $102 million representing the fair value of derivative contracts. The exposure is based on master netting agreements with the related counterparties. Due to developments in the financial markets, credit ratings may not be reflective of the actual related credit risks. In addition to the amounts set forth in the above table, EMG's subsidiaries have posted a $59 million cash margin in the aggregate with PJM, NYISO, Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator ("MISO"), clearing brokers and other counterparties to support hedging and trading activities. The margin posted to support these activities also exposes EMG to credit risk of the related entities.  

The terms of EMG's wind turbine supply agreements contain significant obligations of the suppliers in the form of manufacturing and delivery of turbines, and payments, for delays in delivery and for failure to meet  

79 

Table of Contents 

performance obligations and warranty agreements. EMG's reliance on these contractual provisions is subject to credit risks. Generally, these are unsecured obligations of the turbine manufacturer. A material adverse development with respect to EMG's turbine suppliers may have a material impact on EMG's wind projects and development efforts.  

 Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate changes can affect earnings and the cost of capital for capital improvements or new investments in power projects. EMG mitigates the risk of interest rate fluctuations by arranging for fixed rate financing or variable rate financing with interest rate swaps, interest rate options or other hedging mechanisms for a number of its project financings. A 10% change in market interest rates at December 31, 2010 would increase or decrease the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements by approximately $7 million. The fair market values of fixed interest rate obligations are subject to interest rate risk. The fair market value of EMG's consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was $3.8 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to the carrying value of $4.5 billion. A 10% increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2010 would result in a decrease in the fair value of total long-term debt by approximately $167 million. A 10% decrease in market interest rates at December 31, 2010 would result in an increase in the fair value of total long-term debt by approximately $182 million.

 EDISON INTERNATIONAL PARENT AND OTHER 

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Results of operations for Edison International Parent and Other includes amounts from other Edison International subsidiaries that are not significant as a reportable segment, as well as intercompany eliminations.  

Edison International Parent and Other earnings (loss) from continuing operations were $(8) million, $18 million and $(29) million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in 2010 earnings was primarily due to higher interest and general and administrative costs. The increase in 2009 earnings was primarily due to the impact of the Global Settlement resulting from lower combined state deferred income taxes recorded by Edison International and its subsidiaries under their respective tax-allocation agreements.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Edison International Parent liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and dividends to common shareholders is dependent on dividends from SCE, tax-allocation payments under its tax-allocation agreements with its subsidiaries, and access to bank and capital markets.  

At December 31, 2010, Edison International (parent) had approximately $21 million of cash and equivalents on hand. The following table summarizes the status of the Edison International (parent) credit facility at December 31, 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

Edison International has a debt covenant in its credit facility that requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2010, Edison International's consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.53 to 1.  

 Historical Cash Flows

See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 7. Income Taxes" for further discussion of the Global Settlement.  

 Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities 

Financing activities for 2010 were as follows:   

Issued $400 million of senior notes due in 2017. The proceeds from these bonds were used to repay short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the remainder for corporate liquidity purposes.   

Paid $411 million of dividends (or $0.315 per share quarterly) to Edison International common shareholders. These quarterly dividends represent an increase of $0.005 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2009. In December 2010, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared a $0.32 per share quarterly dividend which was paid in January 2011. This quarterly dividend represents an increase of $0.005 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2010.   

Received $300 million of dividend payments from SCE.   

Repaid a net $66 million of short-term debt.  

Financing activities for 2009 were as follows:   

Paid $404 million of dividends (or $0.31 per share quarterly) to Edison International common shareholders. These quarterly dividends represent an increase of $0.005 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2008.   

Repaid a net $165 million of short-term debt, primarily due to the improvement in economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008.   

Received $300 million of dividend payments from SCE.  

Financing activities for 2008 were as follows:   

Paid $397 million of dividends to Edison International common shareholders.   

Received $325 million of dividend payments from SCE.   

Issued $250 million of short-term debt, primarily due to the economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008.   

Received $120 million from an intercompany loan between Edison Capital and Edison International in 2008.

 EDISON INTERNATIONAL (CONSOLIDATED) 

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

     Potential Regulation of Swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC ("Agencies") with jurisdiction to regulate financial derivative products, including swaps, options and other derivative products ("Swaps"). The Agencies are required to issue rules and regulations that implement regulation of Swaps markets by July 2011.  

The Dodd-Frank Act subjects Swaps to new mandatory clearing and trading requirements, if no exemption applies. It may also impose capital requirements on non-exempt market participants. The clearing and trading requirements could result in increased margining requirements which may increase the costs of hedging activity. SCE uses Swap transactions to hedge commodity price risk and is subject to oversight by the CPUC. EMG and its subsidiaries, particularly EMMT, use Swap transactions to hedge commercial risks associated with the generation, purchase and sale of electricity and fuel to wholesale customers. In addition, EMMT utilizes Swaps as part of its proprietary trading business.  

If new clearing, trading or other requirements are applicable to EMG and SCE under the Dodd-Frank Act rules and regulations, the potential impact will depend on the content of those rules and regulations, which remains uncertain.

 Contractual Obligations 

Edison International's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, for the years 2011 through 2015 and thereafter are estimated below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." Amount includes interest payments totaling $10.4 billion over applicable period of the debt. 

2Some of the power purchase agreements entered into with independent power producers are treated as operating leases and capital leases. At December 31, 2010, minimum operating lease payments for power purchase agreements were $740 million in 2011, $717 million in 2012, $761 million in 2013, $708 million in 2014, $693 million in 2015, and $8.7 billion for the thereafter period. At December 31, 2010, minimum capital lease payments for power purchase agreements were $33 million in 2011, $71 million 2012, $131 million for 2013, $153 million for 2014, $154 million for 2015, and $2.5 billion for the thereafter period (amounts include executory costs and interest of $628 million and $1.2 billion, respectively). For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

3At December 31, 2010, minimum operating lease payments were primarily related to long-term leases for the Powerton and Joliet stations and Homer City facilities and vehicles, office space and other equipment. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

4For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

5Amount includes estimated contributions to the pension and PBOP plans for SCE. These amounts represent estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change. The estimated contributions for SCE are not available beyond 2014. The estimated contributions for all other entities are not available beyond 2011. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 8. Compensation and Benefit Plans" for further information. 

6At December 31, 2010, Edison International had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $552 million, which is excluded from the table. Edison International cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the IRS. 

7The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," respectively.   

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of Edison International's consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or, the use of alternative estimates, that could have a material impact on Edison International's results of operations or financial position. For more information on Edison

International's accounting policies, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."  

 Rate Regulated Enterprises 

 Nature of Estimate Required. SCE follows the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue, these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates; conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. SCE's management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to SCE or other rate-regulated entities in California, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. Using these factors, management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement. This determination reflects the current regulatory climate in California and is subject to change in the future.  

 Effect if Different Assumption Used. Significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund, as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings. At December 31, 2010, the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of $4.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of $5.3 billion. If different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition, SCE's earnings and cash flows may vary from the amounts reported.  

 Derivatives 

 Nature of Estimates Required. As described in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," SCE and EMG use derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rates. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value unless certain exceptions are met in which case the derivative is recorded on an accrual basis.  

SCE records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability due to application of principles for rate-regulated enterprises. As a result, changes in fair value of SCE derivative instruments have no impact on earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows. SCE has not elected to use hedge accounting for these transactions due to the regulatory accounting treatment.  

EMG records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value, with changes in the derivative's fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the effective portion of the changes in the derivative's fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. EMG records derivative instruments used for trading at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income.  

Management's judgment is required to determine if a transaction meets the definition of a derivative and, if it does, whether the normal purchases and sales exception applies or whether individual transactions qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Management's judgment is also required to determine the fair value of derivative transactions.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. SCE and EMG determine the fair value of derivative instruments based on forward market prices in active markets adjusted for nonperformance risk. If quoted market prices are not available, internally developed models are used to determine the fair value. When actual  

85 

Table of Contents 

market prices, or relevant observable inputs are not available, it is appropriate to use unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions, including extrapolating limited short-term observable data and developing correlations between liquid and non-liquid trading hubs. In assessing nonperformance risks, SCE and EMG review credit ratings of counterparties (and related default rates based on such credit ratings) and prices of credit default swaps. The market price (or premium) for credit default swaps represents the price that a counterparty would pay to transfer the risk of default, typically bankruptcy, to another party. A credit default swap is not directly comparable to the credit risks of derivative contracts, but provides market information of the related risk of nonperformance.  

In addition, a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. For further information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Fair Value Measurements."  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. As described above, fair value is determined using a combination of market information or observable data and unobservable inputs which reflect management's assumptions. Changes in observable data would impact results. In addition, unobservable inputs could have an impact on results. Fair value for Level 3 derivatives is derived using observable and unobservable inputs. As of December 31, 2010, SCE and EMG Level 3 derivatives had a net fair value of $6 million and $91 million, respectively. While it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one input, if the fair value of SCE and EMG Level 3 derivatives were increased or decreased by 10%, the impact would be a less than $1 million and a $10 million increase or decrease to operating revenues, respectively. For derivative instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models, a significant change in estimate could affect Edison International's results of operations. For further sensitivities in Edison International's assumptions used to calculate fair value, see "EMG: Results of OperationsFair Value Disclosures" and "SCE: Market Risk ExposuresFair Value of Derivative Instruments." For further information on derivative instruments, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  

 Nuclear DecommissioningARO 

 Nature of Estimate Required. Regulations by the NRC require SCE to decommission its nuclear power plants which is expected to begin after the plants' operating licenses expire. In accordance with authoritative guidance, SCE is required to record an obligation to decommission its nuclear facilities. Nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in utility rates through contributions that are reviewed every three years by the CPUC. Due to regulatory accounting treatment, nuclear decommissioning activities are not expected to affect SCE earnings.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The liability to decommission SCE's nuclear power facilities is based on site-specific studies performed in 2008 and 2007 for San Onofre and Palo Verde, respectively, which estimate that SCE will spend approximately $8.6 billion through 2053 to decommission its active nuclear facilities. Decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each Nuclear Decommissioning Triennial Proceeding. The current estimate is based on the following assumptions from the 2008 and 2007 site-specific study:   

Decommissioning Costs. The estimated costs for labor, dismantling and disposal costs, energy and miscellaneous costs.   

Escalation Rates. Annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future-year dollars. Escalation rates are primarily used for labor, material, equipment, and low level radioactive waste burial costs. SCE's current estimate is based on SCE's decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes, escalated at rates ranging from 1.8% to 6.9% (depending on the cost element) annually.   

Timing. Cost estimates are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current NRC operating licensees expire. The operating licenses currently expire in 2022 for San Onofre Units 2 and 3, and in 2025, 2026 and 2027 for the Palo Verde units.   

Spent Fuel Dry Storage Costs. Cost estimates are based on an assumption that the DOE will begin to take spent fuel in 2015, and will remove the last spent fuel from the San Onofre and Palo Verde sites  

86 

Table of Contents  

by 2051 and 2053, respectively. Costs for spent fuel monitoring are included until 2051 and 2053, respectively.    

Changes in decommissioning technology, regulation, and economics. The current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The ARO for decommissioning SCE's active nuclear facilities was $2.4 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The ARO liability decrease in 2010 was mainly due to a decrease in escalation rates. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability and related regulatory asset. The following table illustrates the increase to the ARO and regulatory asset if the escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions 

 Nature of Estimate Required. Authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet; the assets and/or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income (loss) for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates. Edison International has a fiscal year-end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans.  

 Key Assumptions of Approach Used. Pension and other postretirement obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models. Two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement. Additionally, health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually. Other assumptions, which require management judgment, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.  

87 

Table of Contents 

As of December 31, 2010, Edison International's pension plans had a $4.1 billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was $127 million for 2010. As of December 31, 2010, Edison International's PBOP plans had a $2.4 billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was $61 million for 2010. The following are critical assumptions used to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit for 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The discount rate enables Edison International to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. Edison International selects its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis. This analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows, matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. Two corporate yield curves were considered, Citigroup and AON. 

2To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, current and expected asset allocations are considered, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. A portion of PBOP trusts asset returns are subject to taxation, so the 7.0% rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after-tax basis. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the pension plan assets were 15.4%, 4.6% and 5.1% for the one-year, five-year and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2010, respectively. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the PBOP plan assets were 12.9%, 3.1%, and 3.2% over these same periods. Accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. 

3The health care cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.5% for 2016 and beyond.   

Pension expense is recorded for SCE based on the amount funded to the trusts, as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes, in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis. Any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and will, over time, be recovered from or returned to customers. As of December 31, 2010, this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of $77 million, meaning that the accounting method has recognized more in expense than the ratemaking method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers' accounting for pensions in 1987.  

Edison International's pension and PBOP plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility. SCE funds its pension and PBOP plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the CPUC. Executive pension plans and competitive power generation PBOP plans have no plan assets.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. Edison International's total annual contributions for SCE are recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to SCE's total annual expense.  

A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected benefit obligation for pension by $341 million. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation for pension by $367 million. A one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease the expense by $28 million.  

A one percentage point increase in the discount rate for PBOP would decrease the projected benefit obligation by $303 million. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate for the PBOP would increase the projected benefit obligation by $352 million. A one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on PBOP plan assets would decrease the expense by $15 million. Increasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would increase the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 by $284 million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by $17 million. Decreasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 by $237 million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by $14 million.

 Income Taxes 

 Nature of Estimates Required. As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, Edison International is required to estimate its income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it operates. This process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within Edison International's consolidated balance sheet.  

Edison International takes certain tax positions it believes are applied in accordance with the applicable tax laws. However, these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the IRS, state tax authorities and the courts. Edison International determines its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. Accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment. Management uses judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that a tax position will be sustained, and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized. Judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes. In assessing its uncertain tax positions Edison International considers, among others, the following factors: the facts and circumstances of the position, regulations, rulings, and case law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the experience gained from similar tax positions. Management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements. Edison International continues to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws. A tax liability has been recorded with respect to tax positions in which the outcome is uncertain and the effect is estimable. Such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded. Furthermore, settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 7. Income Taxes" for a further discussion on income taxes.  

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

 Nature of Estimates Required. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance. Authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company's assets or group of assets (without interest charges) is less than its carrying value, asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements. The impairment charges, if applicable, are calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or, in the case of assets expected to be sold, at fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets for impairment are evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist or when there is a commitment to sell or dispose of the asset. These evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as economic or operational analyses.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine: (1) if an indicator of impairment has occurred, (2) how assets should be grouped, (3) the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset's estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists, and (4) if an impairment exists, the fair value of the asset or asset group. Factors that are considered important, which could trigger an impairment, include operating losses from a project, projected future operating losses, the financial condition of counterparties, or significant negative industry or economic trends. The determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in: (1) estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices  

89 

Table of Contents 

that are susceptible to significant change, (2) environmental and maintenance expenditures, and (3) the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues, environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures.  

 Application to EMG's Merchant Coal-Fired Power Plants 

Weak commodity prices combined with continuing, heightened public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal-fired power plants, which may require significant capital and increased operating costs to meet environmental requirements. For a discussion of environmental requirements, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 10. Regulatory and Environmental Developments" Management has reviewed long-term cash flow forecasts that include assumptions about future electricity and fuel prices, future capacity payments under the PJM RPM, and future capital expenditure requirements under different scenarios. Assumptions included in the long-term cash flow forecasts include:   

Observable market prices for electricity and fuel to the extent available and long-term prices developed based on a fundamental price model;   

Long-term capacity prices based on the assumption that the PJM RPM capacity market would continue consistent with its current structure, with expected increases in revenues as a result of declines in reserve margins beyond the price of the latest auctions; and   

Plans for compliance with both existing and possible future environmental regulations.  

If electricity and capacity prices do not increase consistent with the fundamental forecast or if EMG decides not to install additional environmental control equipment and, instead, shuts down one or more coal-fired power plants, the forecasted cash flow would be less than expected and impairment may result.  

EMG includes allocated acquired emission allowances as part of each power plant asset group. In the case of the Powerton and Joliet Stations, EMG also includes prepaid rent in the respective asset group. EMG's unit of account is at the plant level and, accordingly, the closure of a unit at a multi-unit site would not result in an impairment of property, plant and equipment unless such condition were to affect an impairment assessment on the entire plant.  

The following table summarizes the net book value of the merchant coal-fired asset groups at December 31, 2010:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Accounting for Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnities 

 Nature of Estimates Required. Edison International records loss contingencies when it determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into, Edison International records a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification. Gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized.  

90 

Table of Contents 

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter, including the analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility, Edison International may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases. Edison International provides disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. Some guarantees and indemnifications could have a significant financial impact under certain circumstances, and management also considers the probability of such circumstances occurring when estimating the fair value.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, for guarantees and indemnities actual results may differ from the amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on Edison International's consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of contingencies, guarantees and indemnities, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies."
