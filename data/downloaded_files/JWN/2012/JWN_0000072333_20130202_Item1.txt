Item 1. Business.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Nordstrom later incorporated in the state of Washington in 1946 and went on to become one of the leading fashion specialty retailers based in the U.S. We operate 242 U.S. stores located in 31 states as of March 18, 2013, as well as a robust e-commerce business through nordstrom.com. The west and east coasts of the United States are the areas in which we have the largest presence. We have two reportable segments: Retail and Credit.

As of March 18, 2013, the Retail segment includes our 117 'Nordstrom' branded full-line stores and our online store at www.nordstrom.com, our 121 off-price 'Nordstrom Rack' stores, one clearance store that operates under the name 'Last Chance' and our other retail channels including our online private sale subsidiary 'HauteLook,' our two 'Jeffrey' boutiques and one philanthropic 'treasure&bond' store. Through these multiple retail channels, we try to deliver the best customer experience possible. We offer a wide selection of high-quality brand name and private label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. Our integrated Nordstrom full-line stores and online store allow us to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience. Purchases within our stores are primarily fulfilled from that store's inventory, but may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, or from other Nordstrom full-line stores for inventory unavailable at the original store. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our Cedar Rapids fulfillment center, but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom full-line stores. Our customers also have the option to pick up online orders in our Nordstrom full-line stores if inventory is available at that location. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across various channels and improve sales. The Nordstrom Rack stores purchase high-quality name brand merchandise directly from vendors and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from our Nordstrom stores. Our online private sale retailer, HauteLook, offers limited time sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands.

Our Credit segment includes our wholly owned federal savings bank, Nordstrom fsb, through which we provide a private label credit card, two Nordstrom VISA credit cards and a debit card. The credit and debit cards feature a shopping-based loyalty program designed to increase customer visits and spending. Although the primary purpose of our Credit business is to strengthen and build customer relationships, foster greater customer loyalty and drive more sales, we also generate revenues through finance charges and other fees on these cards and save on interchange fees that would be incurred by the Retail segment if our customers used third-party cards.

For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16: Segment Reporting in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

FISCAL YEAR

We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2012 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2013. References to any other years included within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year. 

TRADEMARKS

We have 139 trademarks, each of which is the subject of one or more trademark registrations and/or trademark applications. Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, HauteLook, Halogen, Caslon, and BP. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided that it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.

RETURN POLICY

We have a liberal approach to returns at Nordstrom. We do not have a formal return policy at our Nordstrom full-line stores or online at www.nordstrom.com. If a customer is not satisfied with something they purchased, we evaluate the situation on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of taking care of the customer. We also try to make returns and exchanges easy for our customers, whether in our stores or online, where we offer free shipping and free returns. Our Nordstrom Rack stores generally accept returns up to 30 days from the date of purchase with the original price tag and sales receipt. HauteLook generally accepts returns of apparel, footwear and accessories within 21 days from the date of shipment.

SEASONALITY

Due to our Anniversary Sale in July, the holidays in December and the half-yearly sales that occur in the second and fourth quarters, our sales are typically higher in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year than in the first and third quarters. In 2012, our Anniversary Sale shifted to the last week of July and the first week of August to align with the historical timing of our sale event. This moved one week of event sales to the third quarter.

INVENTORY

We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which has historically extended over the last two weeks of July. As discussed above, in 2012 this shifted to the last week of July and the first week of August. We also purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through December). In 2012, we increased our investment in pack and hold inventory at Nordstrom Rack, which involves the acquisition of merchandise from some of our top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons in order to take advantage of strategic buying opportunities. This inventory is typically held for six months on average and has contributed to the growth in our Rack business. We pay for our merchandise purchases under the terms established with our vendors.

In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of high-quality suppliers, including domestic and foreign businesses. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. We expect our suppliers to meet our "Nordstrom Partnership Guidelines," which address our corporate social responsibility standards for matters such as legal and regulatory compliance, labor, health and safety and the environment, and are available on our website at www.nordstrom.com.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with other national, regional and local retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores, boutiques and Internet businesses. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are customer service and creating a great customer experience in store and online, which includes compelling price and value, fashion newness, quality of products, selection, convenience, technology, product fulfillment, service and stores in top locations.

EMPLOYEES

During 2012, we employed approximately 61,000 employees on a full- or part-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 63,500 employees in July 2012 and 64,500 in December 2012. Substantially all of our employees are non-union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
