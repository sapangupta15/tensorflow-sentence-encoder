PART I 

 Item 1. Business.  

 CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") is a mass media company with operations in the following segments:    

TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of CBS Television, comprised of the  CBS® Television Network, the Company's 30 owned broadcast television stations, CBS Paramount Network Television and CBS Television Distribution, the Company's television production and syndication operations; Showtime® Networks, the Company's premium subscription television program services; and CBS College Sports Network, the Company's cable network devoted to college athletics.   

RADIO: The Radio segment owns and operates 137 radio stations in 29 United States ("U.S.") markets through  CBS Radio®.   

OUTDOOR: The Outdoor segment displays advertising on media, including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks and stadium signage principally through CBS Outdoor® and in retail stores through CBS Outernet. 

INTERACTIVE: The Interactive segment is the Company's online content network for information relating to technology, entertainment, sports, news, business, gaming and music. CBS Interactive's brands include CNET®, CBS.com, CBSSports.com, GameSpot®, TV.com, BNET and Last.fm®. 

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster, which publishes and distributes consumer books under imprints such as Simon & Schuster®, Pocket Books®, Scribner® and Free Press.   

 For the year ended December 31, 2008, contributions to the Company's consolidated revenues from its segments were as follows: Television 64%, Radio 11%, Outdoor 16%, Interactive 3% and Publishing 6%. The Company generated approximately 16% of its total revenues from international regions in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 66% and 16% of total international revenues of approximately $2.25 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively.  

 In December 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. to swap five of CBS Radio's mid-size market radio stations (KBKS-FM (Seattle), WQSR-FM (Baltimore), KXJM-FM and KLTH-FM (Portland) and KQJK-FM (Sacramento)) for Clear Channel's two large market stations in Houston (KLOL-FM and KHMX-FM). In December 2008, the Company also announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell three of its radio stations in Denver (KWLI-FM, KIMN-FM and KXKL-FM) to Wilks Broadcasting for $19.5 million. These radio station transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. On June 30, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of CNET Networks, Inc. ("CNET") common stock for $11.50 per share, for a total of $1.8 billion. CNET has been included in the Company's results from the date of acquisition. Effective July 1, 2008, the Company created a separate Interactive segment, which combined the Company's existing interactive businesses, which were previously reported in the Television segment, with those of CNET. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. In April 2008, the Company acquired International Outdoor Advertising Group, the leading out-of-home advertising company in South America, for $110.8 million. In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of seven of its owned television stations to Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. for $185.0 million. In November 2007, the Company completed the last of its sales of 39 radio stations in 10 of its smaller markets for $668.4 million in the aggregate.  

 As technologies for delivering content and services evolve, and as evidenced by its acquisition of CNET, the Company continues to pursue and expand upon opportunities to distribute content to  

I-1 

consumers through various platforms, including the Internet, mobile devices and video-on-demand. The Company is focused on utilizing interactive features to deepen and broaden its relationship with audiences. The Company has entered into various arrangements to extend the reach of its news, entertainment and other program content across a number of products and platforms with leading Internet, cable and mobile wireless companies, among others.  

 The Company competes with many different entities and media in various markets worldwide. In addition to competition in each of its businesses, the Company competes for opportunities in the entertainment business with other diversified international entertainment companies such as The Walt Disney Company, NBC Universal, Inc., News Corporation, Time Warner Inc., Cox Radio Inc. and Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.  

 As of December 31, 2008, National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI"), a closely held corporation that owns and operates approximately 1,500 movie screens in the U.S., the United Kingdom ("U.K."), South America and Russia and manages 21 movie screens in the U.S. and the U.K., beneficially owned Class A Common Stock of the Company representing approximately 81% of the voting power of all classes of the Company's Common Stock, and approximately 10% of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. Owners of the Company's Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Company's Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Founder of the Company.  

 The Company was organized in Delaware in 1986. The Company's principal offices are located at 51 W. 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019. Its telephone number is (212) 975-4321 and its Web site address is www.cbscorporation.com.  

 CBS CORP. BUSINESS SEGMENTS  

 Television (64%, 65% and 65% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively)  

 The Television segment consists of CBS Television, comprised of the CBS Television Network, the Company's 30 owned broadcast television stations and CBS Paramount Network Television and CBS Television Distribution, the Company's television production and syndication operations; Showtime Networks, the Company's premium subscription television program services; and CBS College Sports Network, the Company's cable network devoted to college athletics.  

 Television Network. The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment, CBS News® and CBS Sports® distributes a comprehensive schedule of news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming, and feature films to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 16 of the Company's owned and operated television stations, and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories. The CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sales of advertising time for its network broadcasts.  

 CBS Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and drama series, reality-based programming, made-for-television movies and miniseries, theatrical films, specials, children's programs, daytime dramas, game shows and late-night programs. In September 2007, CBS Films, a unit of CBS Entertainment, was created to develop and produce a limited slate of films across all genres, each under the $50 million per film category. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS Television Network and the CBS Radio Network with regularly scheduled news and public affairs broadcasts, including 60 Minutes®, CBS Evening News with Katie Couric and  The Early Show, as well as special reports. CBS News Productions, the off-network production company created by CBS  

I-2 

News, produces programming for domestic and international outlets, including the CBS Television Network, cable television, home video, audio-book and in-flight markets, as well as schools and libraries. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath®, a television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to CBS Television Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts include The NFL Today, certain NCAA championships, including the Final Four, golf, including the Masters Tournament and the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, regular-season college football and basketball line-ups on network television, in addition to the NFL's American Football Conference regular season schedule, the Postseason Divisional Playoff games and the AFC championship game. In 2004, CBS Sports entered into a six-year rights extension with the NFL to broadcast the AFC beginning in 2006 and including two Super Bowls. Extending its franchises, CBS Sports has the marketing rights for the 2003-2013 NCAA Championships, including coordination of related multimedia and television, and other related business opportunities. CBS Home Entertainment licenses home video rights and CBS Consumer Products licenses merchandising rights.  

 The CW, a broadcast network and 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, was launched in Fall 2006. The CW's programming includes Gossip Girl, 90210 and America's Next Top Model. Nine of the Company's owned television stations are affiliates of The CW.  

 In late September 2007, at the beginning of the 2007-2008 broadcast season, Nielsen Media Research introduced a television measurement system based on commercial viewership rather than program viewership. The new standard allows for the inclusion of both live and delayed viewing of commercials up to three days after live broadcasts and has become the industry standard for the buying and selling of television commercial time.  

 Television Stations. The Company owns 30 broadcast television stations through its CBS Television Stations group, all of which operate under licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"). The licenses are renewable every eight years. The Company's television stations are located in the 8 largest, and 15 of the top 20, television markets in the U.S. The Company owns multiple television stations within the same designated market area ("DMA") in 9 major markets. These multiple station markets are: Los Angeles (market #2), Philadelphia (market #4), Dallas-Fort Worth (market #5), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (market #6), Boston (market #7), Detroit (market #11), Miami-Ft. Lauderdale (market #16), Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto (market #20), and Pittsburgh (market #23). This network of television stations enables the Company to reach a wide audience within and across geographically diverse markets in the U.S. The stations produce news and broadcast public affairs, sports and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS, The CW or MyNetworkTV programming and syndicated programming. The CBS Television Stations group principally derives its revenues from the sale of advertising time on its television stations. Substantially all of the Company's television stations currently operate Web sites, which promote the stations' programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services. Since October 2006, pursuant to an exclusive video syndication arrangement, local news video from 17 of the Company's television stations has been available on Yahoo! CBS and Yahoo! share revenue from advertising sold adjacent to CBS stations' content on the site.  

 Every three years, each television station must elect, with respect to its retransmission by cable television operators within its DMA, either "must carry" status, pursuant to which the cable system's carriage of the station is mandatory, or "retransmission consent," pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage in order to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company has elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases for the period beginning January 1, 2009, and, since 2006, has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.  

 The Company's owned and operated television stations reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households and approximately 35% of U.S. television households as measured by the FCC's television  

I-3 

national audience reach limitation under which a VHF television station is deemed to reach 100% of the television households in its market and a UHF television station is deemed to reach 50% of the television households in its market. The FCC's ownership rules limit the Company's national audience reach to 39% of all U.S. television households. (See "CBS Corp. Business SegmentsRegulationBroadcastingOwnership Regulation").

 Television Production and Syndication. The Company, through CBS Paramount Network Television and CBS Television Distribution (including King World Productions, CBS Studios and CBS Paramount International Television), produces, acquires and/or distributes programming worldwide, including series, specials, news, public affairs and made-for-television movies. Such programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services or distribution via first-run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The Company also distributes off-network syndicated programming, which is programming exhibited on television stations or cable networks following its exhibition on a network, basic cable network or premium subscription service.  

 Programming that was produced or co-produced by the Company's production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS) and Medium (NBC). Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period. Remaining distribution rights, including foreign and/or off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or foreign markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the Company's objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through domestic syndication of episodes after their network runs and/or by licensing international exhibitions of the episodes. International sales are generally made within one year of U.S. network runs. Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series such as CSI:, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Medium, Survivor and America's Next Top Model as well as a library of older television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray and Judge Judy. The Company also distributes syndicated programming internationally.  

 License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on cable are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in the Television segment's operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were approximately $600.1 million and $582.9 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.  

I-5 

 CBS College Sports Network. CBS College Sports Network is a cable program service featuring events from approximately 25 men's and women's college sports, with approximately 26.6 million subscribers as of January 31, 2009. CBS College Sports Network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising time on its cable program service. In September 2006, the mtn: MountainWest Sports Network was launched. CBS College Sports Network and Comcast Corporation each owns a 50% interest in the mtn, which exhibits Mountain West Conference athletics and is available to U.S. cable and satellite providers.  

 Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks owns and operates three commercial-free, premium subscription television program services in the U.S.: Showtime, offering recently released theatrical feature films, original series, documentaries, boxing, mixed martial arts and other special events; The Movie Channel®, offering recently released theatrical feature films and related programming; and  Flix®, offering theatrical feature films primarily from the 70s, 80s and 90s, as well as selected other titles. At December 31, 2008, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate, had approximately 58.7 million subscriptions in the U.S., certain U.S. territories and Bermuda.  

 Showtime Networks also owns and operates several multiplexed channels of Showtime and The Movie Channel in the U.S. which offer additional and varied programming choices. In addition, Showtime Networks transmits high definition television feeds of  Showtime, The Movie Channel and several of their multiplexed channels, and also makes versions of Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix available "on demand," enabling subscribers to watch selected individual programs at their convenience (in both standard and high definition in the case of Showtime and The Movie Channel, and standard definition in the case of Flix). Showtime Networks also provides special events to licensees on a pay-per-view basis through  Showtime PPV®. Showtime Networks also operates the Web site SHO.com which promotes  Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix programming, and provides information and entertainment and other services.  

 Showtime Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to cable television operators, direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite operators, telephone companies and other distributors. The costs of acquiring premium television rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for Showtime and The Movie Channel, from major or independent motion picture producers and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations. For example, Showtime Networks has recently entered into motion picture output agreements with The Weinstein Company and Summit Entertainment for the exclusive U.S. premium subscription television rights for certain exhibition windows relating to feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S through December 2015 and December 2012, respectively. These exclusive output agreements are in addition to Showtime Networks' exclusive output agreement with Paramount Pictures for feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S through December 2007, and Showtime Networks' exclusive output agreements with each of MGM and Lionsgate for feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S. through December 2008. Showtime Networks also arranges for the development, production and acquisition of original programs, series and documentaries. Showtime Networks' original series include Dexter, Californication, The Tudors, Weeds, Brotherhood, United States of Tara and The L Word, among others. Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives distribution revenue from the rights it retains in certain of its original programming. For example, Showtime Networks and its affiliate(s) have entered into licenses with television networks in various foreign territories for exhibition of certain original series, as well as electronic sell-through arrangements with several Internet distributors, including iTunes and Amazon, among others, for certain Showtime programming.  

 Showtime Networks also owns 90% of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution. In September 2007, this venture launched Smithsonian Channel, a high  

I-6 

definition television program service, in the U.S., and, in March 2008, launched its companion on demand version, in both standard and high definition. This channel features programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature.  

 Television Competition.  

 Television Network. The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in broadcast television are the development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, independent television stations, cable program services as well as other media, including DVDs, print and the Internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience. According to Nielsen Media Research, for the broadcast television primetime daypart for the period September 22, 2008 to January 25, 2009, the CBS Television Network secured the #1 position for total viewers and for key adult viewers ages 25-54 and the #2 position for key adult viewers ages 18-49.  

 Television Stations. Television stations compete for programming, on-air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The owned and operated television stations' competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal.  

 In connection with the conversion to digital television broadcasting, current and future technological and regulatory developments may affect competition within the television marketplace. (See "CBS Corp. Business SegmentsRegulationBroadcasting").  

 Television Production and Syndication. As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups, and independent producers and syndicators such as Disney, Sony, NBC Universal, Warner Bros. and Fox to produce and sell programming both domestically and overseas. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses.  

 CBS College Sports Network. CBS College Sports Network's cable programming service principally competes with other sports-oriented cable programming services for cable and satellite distribution and related revenue, for viewership and for advertising revenue. Consolidation among cable operators has made it more difficult for newer channels to secure broad distribution. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for newer sports programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration or acceptance. CBS College Sports Network's television service also competes with other sports programming services in acquiring the television and broadband rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.  

 Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription television program services in the U.S.: Home Box Office, Inc. and Starz Entertainment Group, L.L.C. Competition among premium subscription television program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to  

I-7 

cable operators, DTH satellite operators, telephone companies and other distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks' premium subscription television program services to subscribers. Home Box Office, Inc. is the dominant company in the U.S. premium subscription television category, offering two premium subscription television program services, HBO and Cinemax. Showtime Networks competes with Home Box Office, Inc. and has a significantly smaller share of the premium subscription television category. Starz Entertainment Group, L.L.C. owns Starz!, another premium subscription television program service, which primarily features recently released theatrical motion pictures and competes with Showtime Networks' and Home Box Office, Inc.'s premium program services. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with broadcast television, basic cable program services and other media, including DVDs, portable devices and the Internet.  

 The terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company's subscription television program services are important to the Company. Consolidation among multichannel video programming distributors and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach favorable terms and could have an adverse effect on revenues. In addition, new entrants providing programming or other services for cable networks, cable operators and other platforms could be competitive with and adversely affect the Company's media businesses, including Showtime Networks' subscription television business.  

 Radio (11%, 12% and 14% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively)  

 The Company's radio broadcasting business operates through CBS Radio, one of the largest operators of radio stations in the U.S. CBS Radio owns and operates 137 radio stations serving 29 U.S. markets as of February 20, 2009. Virtually all of the Company's owned and operated radio stations are located in the 50 largest U.S. radio markets and approximately 76% in the 25 largest U.S. radio markets. CBS Radio also owns three radio stations in Denver which are subject to a sale agreement and have been operated by the purchaser of these stations pursuant to a local marketing agreement effective January 1, 2009 until the closing of the sale. In December 2008, the Company agreed to exchange five of its radio stations in mid-sized markets for two of Clear Channel Communications' radio stations in Houston, a large market. These transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. The Company's strategy generally is to operate radio stations in the largest markets and take advantage of the Company's ability to sell advertising across multiple markets and formats. The Company believes that it is favorably impacted by offering radio, television and outdoor advertising platforms in large markets. The "Radio Stations, Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table below includes information with respect to the Company's radio stations in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.  

 CBS Radio's geographically dispersed stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of formats such as rock, oldies, all-news, talk, adult contemporary, urban, sports and country, and CBS Radio has established leading franchises in news, sports and personality programming. This diversity provides advertisers with the convenience of selecting stations to reach a targeted demographic or of selecting groups of stations to reach broad groups of consumers within and across markets and also reduces the Company's dependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser. At the same time, CBS Radio maintains substantial diversity in each market where its stations operate so that its stations can appeal to several demographic groups. CBS Radio's general programming strategies include employing popular on-air talent, some of whose broadcasts may be syndicated by CBS Radio using the services of a third party syndicator, broadcasting programming syndicated to it by others, acquiring the rights to broadcast sports play-by-play and producing and acquiring news content for its radio stations. The overall mix of each radio station's programming lineup is designed to fit the station's specific format and serve its local community.  

I-8 

 A new electronic audience measurement technology, Arbitron Portable People Meter, has been adopted in 9 of the top 10 markets in which CBS Radio owns and operates radio stations. The Company is monitoring the effects of this new ratings system on the ratings of the Company's radio stations and advertising sales.  

 The majority of CBS Radio's revenues are generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising. The major categories of radio advertisers include: automotive, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, fast food, beverage, movies and entertainment. CBS Radio is able to use the reach, diversity and branding of its radio stations to create unique division-wide marketing and promotional initiatives for major national advertisers of products and services. The success and reputation of CBS Radio and its stations allow the Company to attract the participation of major artists in these national campaigns. Advertising expenditures by local advertisers fluctuate, which has an effect on CBS Radio's revenues.  

 CBS Radio is further extending its station brands online through efforts that include streaming, on-demand audio and video, podcasting, mobile messaging and widgets. Over 150 audio streams of CBS Radio stations and custom channels are available online, including such top brands as 1010 WINS and WFAN-AM, each in New York, and KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. Additionally, CBS Radio has an exclusive agreement with AOL to power the AOL Radio service consisting of the CBS Radio station streams and AOL's over 200 radio station streams, all delivered through CBS Radio's new proprietary technology platform. This Internet radio player gives the consumer a user friendly interface and facilitates programming for the channels and advertising insertion on the player. iPhone and iPod touch users can listen to over 350 radio stations for free via their mobile devices. A similar agreement with Yahoo! was announced in December 2008 to power its Launchcast radio service consisting of a similar mix of CBS Radio station streams and Yahoo!'s radio station streams. This service launched in February 2009. CBS Radio is the most listened to online radio provider according to comScore Arbitron Online Radio Audience Ratings, December 2008. The Company also has agreements with Westwood One, Inc. involving compensation to the Company, the provision of radio programming to CBS Radio and the distribution by Westwood One of CBS Radio News programming.  

 Radio Competition. The Company's radio stations directly compete within their respective markets for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other radio stations, including those owned by other group owners such as Clear Channel Communications, Citadel Broadcasting, Cox Radio, Emmis Communications, Entercom and Radio One. The Company's radio stations also compete with other media, such as broadcast, cable and DTH satellite television, other radio stations, newspapers, magazines, the Internet, including Internet Radio, and direct mail. The radio industry is also subject to competition from Sirius XM Radio Inc., which provides digital audio services to subscribers, sells advertising time on some of its channels and competes with the radio industry for programming.  

 The Company's radio stations face increasing competition from audio programming delivered via the Internet and from consumer products such as portable digital audio players. These new technologies create new ways for individuals to listen to music and other content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements. An increasingly broad adoption by consumers of portable digital audio players could affect the ability of the Company's radio stations to attract listeners and advertisers.  

 The radio broadcast industry is in the process of implementing digital broadcasts. Currently, approximately 1,800 radio stations in the U.S. have implemented digital broadcasting. Because there is no FCC deadline for radio stations to cease broadcasting in an analog mode, radio stations that have implemented digital broadcasting transmit both digitally and in analog. As of February 1, 2009, 107 of the Company's owned radio stations have commenced digital broadcasts. The Company believes that digital transmissions will provide listeners with improved sound quality and new programming channels and should facilitate the convergence of radio with other digital media. It is too early to predict the full effect  

I-9 

that the implementation of digital broadcasts will have on the Company's radio businesses or on competition generally.  

 Aggregate spot advertising sales revenues for the Company's radio stations for 2008 were ranked #1 in three of the top five U.S. markets by metro area population (New York, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth), according to the 2008 Market Total Spot Performance Summary of Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP.

(*)In December 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. to swap five of CBS Radio's mid-size market radio stations (KBKS-FM (Seattle), WQSR-FM (Baltimore), KXJM-FM and KLTH-FM (Portland) and KQJK-FM (Sacramento)) for Clear Channel's two large market stations in Houston (KLOL-FM and KHMX-FM). In December 2008, the Company also announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell three of its radio stations in Denver (KWLI-FM, KIMN-FM and KXKL-FM) to Wilks Broadcasting for $19.5 million, which stations have been operated by Wilks Broadcasting pursuant to a local marketing agreement effective January 1, 2009 until the closing of the sale. These radio station transactions are subject to customary closing conditions.  

I-11 

 Outdoor (16%, 16% and 15% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively)  

 The Company sells, through its Outdoor businesses, advertising space on various media, including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platform and terminal), mall kiosks and stadium signage and in retail stores. It has outdoor advertising operations in more than 100 markets in North America, including all 50 of the largest metropolitan markets in the U.S., 19 of the 20 largest metropolitan markets in Canada and all 45 of the largest metropolitan markets in Mexico. Additionally, Outdoor has the exclusive rights to manage advertising space on approximately 90% of the total bus fleet in the U.K. and has a variety of outdoor advertising displays in the Netherlands, France, Italy, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and China. The Company operates its Outdoor businesses through CBS Outdoor in the U.S., Canada and Europe, CBS Outernet in the U.S. and  Vendor® in Mexico. In April 2008, the Company acquired International Outdoor Advertising Group, the leading out-of-home advertising company in South America. The "Radio Stations, Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table above includes information with regard to the Company's outdoor advertising properties in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.  

 The substantial majority of Outdoor's revenues are generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising. Advertising rates are based on supply and demand for the particular locations, which are influenced by a particular display's exposure known as "impressions" delivered in relation to the demographics of the particular market and its location within that market. Currently, these impressions are not measured by independent third parties. The Company cannot predict the impact, if any, on the Outdoor business should impressions become measured independently. The major categories of out-of-home advertisers include: entertainment, media, automotive, beverage, financial, real estate, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, restaurants, health and beauty aids, hotels and professional services. Out-of-home media industry advertising expenditures by retailers and the entertainment industry fluctuate, which has an effect on Outdoor's revenues.  

 Outdoor generally operates in the billboard, transit, street furniture and retail store advertising markets. Outdoor primarily operates two types of billboard advertising displays, commonly referred to as "bulletins" and "posters."  

 Billboard space is generally sold for periods ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months. Billboards are generally mounted on structures owned by Outdoor located on leased real property. Lease agreements are negotiated with both public and private landowners for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to year-to-year, can be for terms of 10 years or longer and may provide for renewal options. There is no significant concentration of billboards under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord.  

 Transit advertising includes advertising on or in transit systems, including the interiors and exteriors of buses, trains and trams and at rail stations. Transit advertising contracts are negotiated with public transit authorities and private transit operators and generally provide for payment to the transit authority of a percentage of the revenues, a fixed payment, or the greater of a percentage of the revenues or a fixed payment. Where revenues are lower than anticipated, the minimum amount required to be paid to a transit authority may exceed, or be a high percentage of, the advertising revenues received by Outdoor under that advertising contract.  

 Street furniture displays, the most common of which are bus shelters, reach both vehicular and pedestrian audiences. Bus shelters are usually constructed, installed and maintained by Outdoor. Most of Outdoor's bus shelter contracts include revenue-sharing arrangements with a municipality or transit authority and often include minimum required payments. Street furniture contracts usually involve a competitive bidding process and contracts typically are for a term of between 10 to 20 years. Contracts are awarded on the basis of projected revenues to the municipality, including minimum payments, and Outdoor's willingness to construct public facilities, such as bus shelters, public toilets and information kiosks. In both its transit and street furniture negotiations, Outdoor seeks to reduce minimum payment  

I-12 

obligations on new agreements and on renewal of existing agreements. There is no assurance that Outdoor will be successful in reducing its minimum payments, entering into new agreements or renewing certain existing agreements and any such agreements may provide a lesser return to the Company.  

 New technologies for outdoor advertising displays, such as changeable message displays and digital billboards using light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display technology, continue to evolve. The Company keeps apprised of and has adopted such new technologies as they evolve and mature. For example, Outdoor is utilizing digital technology containing moving images in the London Underground and New York City subways. In July 2006, Outdoor reached an 8.5 year agreement to sell advertising on the London Underground. The construction and installation work by the Company for the London Underground is continuing. In October 2007, the Company acquired SignStorey, Inc. (renamed CBS Outernet), a leading distributor of video programming and advertising content to retail stores, which enables customized messaging by region and retail environment. Generally, CBS Outernet enters into revenue-sharing arrangements with retailers based on advertising sales.  

 Outdoor's business strategy involves expanding its presence in major selected markets, to grow its revenues and cash flow by being a leading provider of out-of-home advertising services in the markets it serves, controlling costs, developing and entering into new markets and using advanced technologies to build greater awareness and promote tactical advertising. In addition, the Company purchases outdoor advertising assets within its existing markets or in contiguous markets. The Company believes that there will be continuing opportunities for implementing its acquisition and development strategies given the outdoor advertising industry's fragmentation. This is particularly true in the international markets where there are opportunities for Outdoor to increase profitability both from acquiring additional assets in or near its existing operations and from future acquisitions in new markets.  

 Outdoor Competition. The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising such as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc., JC Decaux S.A., Cemusa Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of display faces in a single or a few local markets. The Company also competes with other media, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, the Internet and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, it competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media and cost-per-thousand impressions, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor advertising industry relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to reach a broad segment in a specific market or to target a particular geographic area or population with a particular demographic within that market. The Company keeps apprised of the evolution of new technologies in the industry. As new technologies such as digital billboards prove desirable to Outdoor's customers and deliver appropriate returns on investment, the Company's costs could increase.  

I-13 

 The Company believes that its strong emphasis in sales and customer service and its position as a leading provider of advertising services in each of its primary markets as well as its international inventory enables it to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as other media, within those markets.  

 Interactive (3%, 1% and 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively)  

 CBS Interactive operates one of the leading online content networks for information and entertainment. In June 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of CNET Networks, Inc., which complements and expands the Company's interactive footprint. CBS Interactive is ranked among the top 10 Internet properties in the world according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2008. CBS Interactive's leading brands, including CNET, CBS.com,  CBSSports.com, GameSpot, TV.com,  Last.fm and BNET, among others, serve targeted audiences with text, video, audio, and mobile content spanning technology, entertainment, sports, news, business, gaming and music categories. In addition to its U.S.-based business, CBS Interactive operates in Asia and Europe. CBS Interactive's worldwide brands reached approximately 226 million unique monthly visitors during December 2008.  

 CBS Interactive generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising and sponsorships, in addition to fees derived from search and commerce partners, licensing fees, subscriptions, e-commerce activities, and other paid services. Advertising spending on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly with economic conditions. In addition, online marketing spending follows seasonal consumer behavior throughout the calendar year to reflect trends during the calendar year.  

 CNET.com is one of the leading Web sites for technology and consumer electronics information. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company relaunched CNET.com, making it easier for people to find information and learn about today's digital world.  GameSpot is the number one gaming information Web site according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2008.  GameSpot's content includes video games reviews and previews, news, Webcasts, videos, online tournaments and game downloads.  CBSSports.com provides Internet sports content, fantasy sports, community and e-commerce features.  CBSSports.com owns and operates CBSCollegeSports.com and MaxPreps.com and hosts the NCAA March Madness on Demand video player that provides live streaming video of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship. TV.com, which was relaunched in December 2008, is a leading destination for entertainment and community around television where visitors can watch videos and discuss and obtain information about television shows across all networks. BNET is a top ten business media site, offering award-winning original content, as well as one of the largest business libraries available on the Internet. Last.fm is a community-based, music discovery site, which reached approximately 20 million unique monthly visitors worldwide during December 2008 according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2008.  Last.fm relaunched in July 2008 making it easier for users to share and play music as well as providing advertisers with targeted ways to reach users. Through CBS.com, CBS Audience Network delivers the Company's content, including from the Web sites of the Company's television, radio and affiliated stations, through new and existing advertiser-supported deals. The growing slate of CBS entertainment, news and sports content available includes full episodes, clips and highlights based on CBS and Showtime Networks programming as well as original made-for-the-Web content.  

 Interactive Competition. CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including the following: general purpose portals such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!, especially as these properties expand their content offerings; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and MSN; online comparison shopping and retail properties, including Shopping.com, Amazon.com and eBay; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive's brands serve, such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, and lifestyle focused Web sites; and emerging platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified  

I-14 

media companies that provide both online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.  

 Publishing (6% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006)  

 The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster, which publishes and distributes consumer books in the U.S. and internationally.  

 Simon & Schuster publishes and distributes adult and children's consumer books in printed, audio and digital formats in the U.S. and internationally. Digital formats include audio downloads for the Apple iPod and MP3 players as well as e-books for increasingly popular devices such as Amazon's Kindle and the Sony Reader Digital Book. Simon & Schuster's major adult imprints include Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner, Atria Books®,Simon Spotlight® Entertainment, and Free Press. Simon & Schuster's major children's imprints include Simon Spotlight®, Aladdin Paperbacks® and  Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers. Simon & Schuster also develops special imprints and publishes titles based on CBS Television Network's and Showtime Networks' products as well as that of third parties and distributes products for other publishers. Simon & Schuster distributes its products directly and through third parties. Simon & Schuster also delivers content and promotes its products on general Internet sites as well as those linked to individual titles; its created assets include online videos showcasing Simon & Schuster authors and new releases on YouTube, Bookvideos.tv, SimonandSchuster.com and other sites. International publishing includes the international distribution of English-language titles through Simon & Schuster UK, Simon & Schuster Canada and Simon & Schuster Australia and other distributors, as well as the publication of local titles by Simon & Schuster UK.  

 In 2008, Simon & Schuster published 166 titles that were New York Times bestsellers, including 21 New York Times #1 bestsellers. Best-selling titles in 2008 include  YOU: Being Beautiful by Michael F. Roizen, M.D., and Mehmet C. Oz, M.D., The Purpose of Christmas by Rick Warren and Duma Key by Stephen King. Bestselling children's titles from Simon & Schuster include Paula Deen's My First Cookbook by Paula Deen with Martha Nesbit, Tweak by Nic Sheff and Alphabet by Matthew Van Fleet. Simon & Schuster Digital, through SimonandSchuster.com, publishes original content, builds reader communities and promotes and sells Simon & Schuster's books over the Internet.  

 The consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster's sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster's top 10 accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions.  

 Publishing Competition. The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected over the years by consolidation trends. Significant mergers have occurred among the leading consumer publishers. Mass merchandisers and on-line retailers are significant factors in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. There have also been a number of mergers completed in the distribution channel. The Company must compete with other larger publishers such as Random House, Penguin Group and Harper Collins for the rights to works by authors. Competition is particularly strong for well-known authors and public personalities. In addition, technological changes have made it increasingly possible for authors to self-publish and have led to the development of new digital distribution models in which the Company's books must compete with the availability of both a larger volume of books as well as non-book content.  

 REGULATION  

 The Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are  

I-15 

subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses.   

 Intellectual Property and Privacy   

 Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See "Intellectual Property" on page I-21).  

 Copyright Law and Content. In the U.S., the copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years. For works made-for-hire, the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation.  

 Unauthorized Distribution and Piracy. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the Internet without regard to content owners' copyright rights in television programming and clips, such as through file "sharing" and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit their property. The Company is engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and has participated in various litigations, educational and public relations programs and legislative activity. In addition to these efforts, the Company continues to enter into and explore possibilities for commercial arrangements with various online providers to further protect and exploit its content.  

 Privacy. The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company's interactive businesses. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its legal and regulatory compliance programs.   

 Broadcasting   

 General. Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations' frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.  

 Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable and DTH satellite systems and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.  

 Indecency and Profanity Regulation. The FCC's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC's indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC in the last several years has stepped up its enforcement efforts as they apply to indecency and profanity, and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licensees for "serious" indecency or profanity violations. Pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress, in July 2007, the FCC increased the forfeiture penalties for broadcasting indecent or profane programming to a maximum of $325,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3.0 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company is and has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material. The Company entered into a Consent Decree with the FCC in November 2004 pursuant to which the Company made a $3.5 million voluntary contribution to the U.S.  

I-16 

Treasury and agreed to provide training with respect to FCC indecency regulation to programming-related personnel at its broadcast television and radio operations and to implement other measures to reduce the risk of broadcasting indecent or profane material. The Company also entered into a Consent Decree with the FCC in 2007, pursuant to which the Company made a $300,000 voluntary contribution to the U.S. Treasury and the FCC and the Company settled certain disputes pertaining to the 2004 Consent Decree. (See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionLegal MattersIndecency Regulation" on page II-32).  

 License Renewals. Radio and television broadcast licenses are granted for a term of eight years. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has a number of pending renewal applications, 8 of which have been opposed by third parties (there are 2 opposed renewal applications for Radio and 6 opposed renewal applications for Television).  

 License Assignments. The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Third parties may oppose the Company's applications to transfer or acquire additional broadcast licenses.  

 Ownership Regulation. The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have an official position or ownership interest, known as an "attributable" interest, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition of a broadcast radio or television station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest. In December 2007, the FCC concluded a proceeding which examined whether to modify its various ownership rules, but with the exception of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule, the FCC declined to do so. The FCC's action has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by the Company and other interested parties.  

 The FCC's ownership rules are briefly summarized below.   

 Local Radio Ownership. The FCC's local radio ownership rule applies in all markets where the Company owns radio stations. Under that rule, one party may own up to eight radio stations in the largest markets, no more than five of which may be either AM or FM. With a few exceptions, the rule permits the common ownership of 8 radio stations in the top 50 markets, where CBS Radio has significant holdings. The Company's FM radio portfolio exceeds the FCC's numerical limit in two markets, Baltimore and West Palm Beach, which are grandfathered. While the rules do not require the divestiture of any existing radio ownership combinations, the Company is not permitted to transfer its radio portfolios in those two markets intact, except to qualified small businesses. Upon the closing of the pending swap involving five of its radio stations in mid-size markets for two radio stations in Houston, the Company's radio holdings in the Baltimore market will comply with the FCC's limit.  

 Local Television Ownership. Under the FCC's local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the FCC, and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations remain in the market following the acquisition. Further, without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap. Satellite television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a "parent" television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the "parent" station.   

I-17 

 Television National Audience Reach Limitation. Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of calculating the total number of television households reached by a station, the FCC attributes a UHF television station with only 50% of the television households in its market. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that have an aggregate television national audience reach for purposes of the national ownership limitation of approximately 35%, after applying the UHF discount, and approximately 38% without the UHF discount.  

 Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule. The radio-television cross-ownership rule limits the common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market. The numeric limit varies according to the number of independent media voices in the market. The Company owns a combination of radio and television stations in the Los Angeles market in excess of the limit. The Company has an application pending before the FCC which, if granted, would bring the Company into compliance with the rule.  

 Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership. In December 2007, the FCC modified the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule permitting cross-ownership of daily newspapers and broadcast stations in the top 20 markets under certain circumstances and establishing a waiver procedure for such combinations in smaller markets.  

 Dual Network Rule. The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.  

 Attribution of Ownership. Under the FCC's attribution rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various types of securities of an entity which holds FCC licenses, such as the Company, could violate the foregoing FCC ownership regulations or policies if that purchaser owned or acquired an "attributable" interest in other media properties. Under the FCC's rules, an "attributable" interest for purposes of the FCC's broadcast ownership rules generally includes: equity and debt interests which combined exceed 33% of a licensee's total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensee's total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest, whether television, radio, cable or newspaper; a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless properly "insulated" from management activities; and any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent. The FCC is currently reviewing its single majority voting shareholder attribution exemption which renders as non-attributable voting interests up to 49% in a licensee controlled by a single majority voting shareholder. Because the Company and Viacom Inc. have the same single majority voting shareholder, the business of each company is attributable to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the Company. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors"The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes").  

 Alien Ownership. In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 20% of the voting power or equity of the Company.   

 Analog to Digital Transition. As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations will be required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. While broadcast television stations are permitted to cease analog transmissions prior to June 12, 2009, the Company intends to continue both analog and digital broadcasts until that date. All of the Company's full power television stations have commenced digital broadcasting, with the exception of WPCW, the Company's The CW-affiliated station in Pittsburgh. Digital broadcasting permits stations to offer digital channels for a wide variety of services such as high definition video programming, multiple channels of standard definition video programming, audio, data, and other types of communications, subject to the requirement  

I-18 

that each broadcaster provide at least one free over-the-air video program signal at least comparable in resolution to the station's analog programming transmissions.  

 The Company has incurred considerable costs in the conversion to digital television and is unable to predict the effect of the cessation of analog broadcasting and the extent or timing of consumer demand for digital television services and the resulting impact on the Company's viewership.  

 Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, each station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either "must carry" status, pursuant to which the cable system's carriage of the station is mandatory, or "retransmission consent," pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage in order to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company has elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases for the period beginning January 1, 2009, and, since 2006, has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.  

 Similarly, federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DTH satellite operators. DTH satellite operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DTH satellite operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect "must carry" or "retransmission consent" status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to cable systems. Substantially all of the Company's owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DTH satellite operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements.  

 After the broadcast television transition from analog to digital in June 2009, cable television systems are required for a three-year period to carry must-carry signals in an analog format or in the case of all-digital cable systems to provide equipment to convert must-carry digital signals for viewing on analog television sets. Cable television systems, with some exceptions, are also required to carry such stations' high definition signals. DTH satellite operators are also required, over a four-year phase-in period, to carry the high definition signals of must-carry stations. Neither cable systems nor DTH satellite operators are required to carry more than a station's primary video programming channel. The Company has agreements with a number of multiple system operators that require carriage of the analog, digital and high-definition signals of the Company-owned television stations before and after the transition (including multiple streams of digital programming).  

 Children's Television Programming. Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display during children's programming of Internet addresses of Web sites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.  

 Program Access. Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's regulations. The FCC's "program access" rules also limit the ability of a vertically integrated cable programmer to enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable operators. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC's program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned by a cable operator in whole or in part. Cable operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers.  

I-19 

The Company's wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company's flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Certain actions of the Company with respect to program access rules are addressed under the terms of a separation agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to this report (the "Separation Agreement"), between the Company and Viacom Inc. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors"The Separation Agreement Prohibits the Company from Engaging in Certain Types of Businesses").  

 Digital Radio. For a number of years, the FCC has been developing rules that would permit existing AM and FM radio broadcast stations to broadcast digitally in order both to improve sound quality and to provide spectrum for enhanced data services to complement the existing programming service and provide new business opportunities for radio broadcasters, including multicasting opportunities. The FCC has authorized AM and FM radio stations to broadcast digital signals using excess spectrum within the same allotted bandwidth used for analog transmissions. As of February 1, 2009, 107 of the Company's radio stations had commenced digital broadcasts.   

 Outdoor   

 The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and to national, regional and local restrictions in foreign countries. These regulations can affect the operation of advertising displays and include restrictions on the construction, repair, upgrading, height, size and location of outdoor advertising structures and, in some instances, the content of advertising copy that can be displayed on these structures. In addition, outdoor advertising is the subject of targeted state and municipal taxes and fees. These laws may affect competitive conditions in various markets in various ways. Such laws may reduce the Company's expansion opportunities, or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from others. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations and the enforcement thereof will not materially and adversely affect the Outdoor business.  

 Under U.S. law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the "HBA"), outdoor advertising is controlled on primary and interstate highways built with federal financial assistance. As a condition to federal highway assistance, the HBA requires states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and industrial areas, and imposes certain additional size, spacing and other requirements associated with the installation and operation of billboards. Outdoor is not aware of any states which have passed laws and adopted regulations which are less restrictive than the federal requirements, including the obligation on the part of the billboard owner to remove, at the owner's expense and without compensation, any non-grandfathered signs on such highways that do not comply with such requirements. Outdoor does not believe that the number of its billboards that may be subject to removal under these regulations is material. No state in which Outdoor operates has banned billboards, but some have adopted standards more restrictive than the federal requirements. Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes. Some state and local governments prohibit construction of new billboards and some allow new construction only to replace existing structures, although most allow construction of billboards subject to restrictions on zoning, size, spacing, height and type of construction. In some cases, the construction of new billboards or the relocation or modification of existing billboards is prohibited. A number of cities including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Miami have implemented or initiated legislative billboard controls, including imposing taxes, fees and/or registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. The Company contests such laws and regulations that it believes unlawfully restrict its constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of its outdoor advertising business.  

 U.S. law neither requires nor prohibits removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. State governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for beautification objectives in the past using federal funding for  

I-20 

transportation enhancement programs, and may do so in the future. State government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove billboards. Thus far, Outdoor has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for its billboards purchased or removed as a result of this type of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. Local governments do not generally purchase billboards for beautification, but some have attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations) after a period of years under a concept called amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over time. Although there is some question as to the legality of amortization under federal and many state laws, amortization has been upheld in some instances. Outdoor generally has been successful in negotiating settlements with municipalities for billboards required to be removed. Restrictive regulations also limit Outdoor's ability to rebuild or replace nonconforming billboards.  

 As the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities in outdoor advertising operations, the Company must comply with various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. The Company and its properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety, as well as zoning and other land use restrictions which may affect, among other things, the hours of operation and illumination as well as methods and conditions of maintenance of facilities and advertising installation. Historically, the Company has not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, future laws or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws could require the Company to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict its ability to use or operate some of its displays.  

 Out-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies, the U.S. government, and all 50 states include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. State and local governments continue to initiate proposals designed to limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Other products and services may be targeted in the future. Legislation regulating alcohol-related advertising due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in Outdoor's direct revenue from such advertisements and a simultaneous increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.
