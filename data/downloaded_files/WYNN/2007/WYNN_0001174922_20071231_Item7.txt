ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview  

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened on April 28, 2005, and Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), which opened on September 6, 2006. In addition, on April 28, 2006, we commenced construction of Encore Suites at Wynn Las Vegas or Encore, a hotel casino resort which, when completed, will be fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas. We have also commenced construction of Wynn Diamond Suites an additional hotel tower for Wynn Macau. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, we were solely a development stage company.  

Our Resorts  

The following table sets forth information about our operating properties as of February 2008:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Wynn Las Vegas  

Wynn Las Vegas is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip and utilizes approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue, a portion of which is utilized for employee parking.  

We believe Wynn Las Vegas is the preeminent destination casino resort on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas currently features:  

       An approximately 111,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book;  

       Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas;  

       22 food and beverage outlets featuring signature chefs, including the AAA Five Diamond, Mobil Five Star and Michelin award-winning restaurant, Alex;  

       A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership;  

       Approximately 74,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta, Vertu and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18-hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and a full service spa and salon; and,  

       Two showrooms, two nightclubs and lounges.  

The Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas is the only casino resort in the world that has been awarded both the Mobil five star and AAA five diamond distinctions. In addition, Wynn Las Vegas was recognized in November 2007 by Michelin, the esteemed European restaurant rating system. Two Michelin stars were awarded to Alex

 and one Michelin star was awarded to each of Wing Lei and Daniel Boulud Brasserie. Additionally, Wynn Las Vegas received five red pavilions, the highest honor for Michelin rated accommodations.  

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2007.  

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas  

We are constructing Encore on approximately 20 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Encore plans include a 2,034 all-suite hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, an approximately 72,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, as well as restaurants, a nightclub, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. Encore is expected to open in December 2008.  

Wynn Macau  

We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006. Wynn Macau currently features:  

       An approximately 205,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, approximately 380 table games and approximately 1,270 slot machines;  

       Luxury hotel accommodations in 600 rooms and suites;  

       Casual and fine dining in five restaurants;  

       Approximately 46,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Bvlgari, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Fendi, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu, Zegna and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and spa; and,  

       Lounges and meeting facilities.  

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed an expansion of our Wynn Macau property. This expansion included approximately 75,000 square feet of additional gaming space, additional food and beverage amenities and three new retail stores. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, six additional retail stores opened. In addition to the gaming and retail facilities that opened in the expansion noted above, Wynn Macau opened its rotunda area which features a gold prosperity tree in conjunction with a Chinese zodiac-inspired ceiling level show incorporating a descending chandelier.  

We have commenced construction on a further expansion of Wynn Macau, which was first announced in November 2006. This further expansion will add a fully-integrated resort hotel named Wynn Diamond Suites, with approximately 400 luxury suites and six villas, as well as additional VIP gaming areas, food and beverage and retail amenities. We expect Wynn Diamond Suites to open in the first half of 2010.  

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Macau and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to the property after its opening in 2006 and continued such enhancements during 2007.  

We operate Wynn Macau under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002.  

Cotai Development  

We have submitted an application to the Macau government for a concession of land in Cotai. We have reconfigured our site plan for 52 acres and are awaiting final approval. We are actively engaged in the design of our Cotai project.

Results of Operations  

Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons:  

       On September 11, 2006, Wynn Macau completed the sale of a Macau subconcession right and received a cash payment of $900 million;  

       On September 6, 2006, we opened Wynn Macau and began generating operating cash flow;  

       On April 28, 2005, we opened Wynn Las Vegas and began generating operating cash flow. Prior to April 28, 2005, we were solely a development stage company.  

Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 include full years of operations for both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. In contrast, the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a full year of operations for Wynn Las Vegas and 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau. Wynn Las Vegas operated for 248 days in the year ended December 31, 2005. The table below displays our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The reliance on our operating cash flow from only two properties exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two properties, many of our customers are high-end gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.  

Operating Measures  

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussions of our operational performance for the periods in which a Consolidated Statement of Operations is presented. Casinos generally record table games win as a percentage of either drop or turnover and slot win as a percentage of handle. In our casino operations at Wynn Las Vegas, table games win is recorded as a percentage of drop. However, in our casino operations at Wynn Macau, we separate table play into two distinct segments. Our Macau VIP casino segment records table games win as a percentage of turnover, whereas our general casino records win as a percentage of drop.  

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:  

       Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.  

       Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box.  

       Turnover is the sum of all losing wagers within our Wynn Macau VIP program.  

       Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau and is recorded as casino revenue.  

       Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.  

       Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 are comprised of $1,949.9 million in casino revenues (72.6% of total net revenues) and $737.6 million of net non-casino revenues (27.4% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of $800.6 million in casino revenues (55.9% of total net revenues) and $631.7 million of net non-casino revenues (44.1% of total net revenues). The quality of our resorts non-casino amenities, combined with providing guests an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in our properties ADR as well as increased the length of casino play.  

Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $1,949.9 million represents approximately a $1,149.3 million (or 143.6%) increase from casino revenues of $800.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The year ended December 31, 2007 includes a full year of Wynn Macaus operations, compared to only 117 days in 2006. At Wynn Las Vegas, we experienced a 14.6% increase in drop for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 25.3% was above the expected range of 21% to 24%. Table games win percentage was 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas increased less than 1% during the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Wynn Macaus win percentage for the VIP casino segment of 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, was just above the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%. The average table games win percentage at the general casino at Wynn Macau of 19% was at the top of the expected range of 17% to 19%. Wynn Macaus slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%.  

For the year ended December 31, 2007, room revenues were approximately $339.4 million, which represents a $56.3 million (or 19.9%) increase over the $283.1 million generated in the year ended December 31, 2006. Wynn Macau generated $38.8 million of this increase in room revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007, its first full year of operations. See the table below for key operating measures related to room revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $354 million, retail revenues of approximately $124.4 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $64.5 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $56.3 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $309.8 million, retail revenues of approximately $87.7 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.3 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $51.2 million. The full year of operations at Wynn Macau during 2007 compared to only 117 days in 2006 was the primary contributor to the increase in the food and beverage, retail and other revenues. Entertainment revenues decreased slightly due to the closure of the Le Réve theater during March 2007 for renovations.

Departmental, administrative and other expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2007, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,168.1 million, rooms expenses of $83.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $212.6 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.1 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $310.8 million and approximately $36.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2006, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $439.9 million, room expenses of $73.9 million, food and beverage expenses of $194.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $134.5 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $231.5 million and approximately $21.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The increase in expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations of Wynn Macau, including the 39 percent gross win tax on casino revenue, and increases in Wynn Las Vegas expenses commensurate with the increase in revenues.  

Pre-opening costs  

Pre-opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $7.1 million decreased by $55.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to advertising costs associated with the opening of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas as well as costs related to Encore and the expansion of Wynn Macau. We expect that pre-opening costs will continue to be incurred in the months before opening as construction and development of Encore and the Wynn Diamond Suites progress.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $219.9 million increased by $44.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a full year of depreciation expense associated with Wynn Macau as well as the placement into service of Wynn Macaus expansion.  

During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly.  

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Contract termination fee  

In February 2006, we agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive Las Vegas run at Wynn Las Vegas Broadway Theater at the end of May 2006. To terminate the contract, we paid a termination fee of $5 million. This fee was recorded in the first quarter of 2006 in accordance with the liability recognition provisions of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.  

Property charges and other  

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau properties and the reactions of our guests, we have made and continue to make enhancements and refinements to our properties. Costs relating to assets retired or abandoned as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $70.2 million have been expensed as property charges. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2007 include the following abandonment charges taken at Wynn Macau: (a) a   

40  

Table of Contents 

 $10.2 million charge for the abandonment of costs related to portions of the main kitchen, warehouse, and restaurants to enable the main casino to be connected with the expansion; (b) a $10 million charge related to the abandonment of a parking garage to make way for Wynn Diamond Suites; (c) a $22.1 million charge related to significant casino and retail reconfigurations in the expansion; and (d) a $15.5 million charge related to the abandonment of a theater. The remaining property charges were related to renovations to portions of the Le Rêve Theater, the abandonment of a marquee sign and the conversion of two retail outlets and a nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas, as well as the remodeling of certain areas at Wynn Macau. Offsetting these charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 is a gain of $9.4 million on the sale of a company aircraft.  

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar, improved public baccarat space and private baccarat salons and converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories at Wynn Las Vegas. In December 2006, Wynn Macau donated an early Ming dynasty vase to the Macau Museum. We purchased the vase in May 2006 for approximately $10.1 million. The vase had been on public display at Wynn Macau prior to its donation to the museum. The $10.1 million expense for the donation of the Ming Vase is included in Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006.  

In response to our evaluation of our properties and the reactions of our guests, we continue to make enhancements to both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest and other income increased by $1 million to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Interest expense was $143.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $44.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $148 million, net of capitalized interest of $29.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total interest cost increased approximately $10.7 million due to our new $1 billion Term Loan, approximately $4.4 million related to the additional $400 million first mortgage notes issued in November 2007 and approximately $2.0 million related to borrowings under our existing credit facilities and other debt. These increases were offset by approximately $6.2 million less interest due to the conversion of the Debentures in July 2007, as well as an increase of $15.1 million in capitalized interest related to our construction activities.  

Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded an expense of approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded a gain of $1.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 3Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Income taxes  

Our effective tax rate of 21.1% is lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 35% primarily due to the portion of Macau earnings that we consider permanently invested abroad, the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign income, and the tax holiday applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau S.A. as described below.  

Effective December 31, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $26.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in such   

41  

Table of Contents 

 taxes. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and our casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of $800.6 million in casino revenues (55.9% of total net revenues) and $631.7 million of net non-casino revenues (44.1% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 were comprised of $353.7 million in net casino revenues (49.0% of total net revenues) and $368.3 million of net non-gaming revenues (51.0% of total net revenues). The quality of our resorts non-gaming amenities, combined with providing guests an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in our properties ADR and other non-gaming revenues.  

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $800.6 million, which represents approximately a $446.9 million (or 126.4%) increase from the casino revenues of $353.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in casino revenues was driven primarily by the opening of Wynn Macau in September 2006 and Wynn Las Vegas being open for all of 2006 as opposed to only 248 days in 2005. At Wynn Las Vegas, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 22.1% was within the expected range of 20% to 23% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas for 2006 increased as compared to 2005, however the slot win percentage for 2006 was slightly below the expected range of 5% to 6%. Wynn Macaus win percentage for the VIP casino segment of 2.4% of turnover was below the then expected range of 2.5% to 2.8%. However, turnover, the leading volume indicator in the VIP casino, met managements expectations. The average table games win percentage at the general casino at Wynn Macau of 17.1% of drop was at the lower end of the expected range of 17% to 19%, and the volume of table game play was as expected. Wynn Macaus slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%.  

For the year ended December 31, 2006, room revenues were approximately $283.1 million, which represented a $112.8 million (or 66.2%) increase over the $170.3 million generated in the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily driven by Wynn Las Vegas being open for the full year as opposed to 248 days of operations in 2005, as well as Wynn Macaus 117 days of operations in 2006. See the table below for key operating measures related to room revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $309.8 million, retail revenues of approximately $87.7 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.3 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately   

42  

Table of Contents 

 $51.2 million. Other non-casino revenues for the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. The additional revenue earned in Wynn Macaus 117 days of operations during 2006 contributed to the increase in the food and beverage and retail revenues. In addition, food and beverage revenues in 2006 benefited significantly from increased revenues from the nightclubs located in Wynn Las Vegas as compared to the 2005 food and beverage revenues.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2006, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $439.9 million, rooms expenses of $73.9 million, food and beverage expenses of $194.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $134.5 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $231.5 million and approximately $21.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2005, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, room expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The increase in expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of 117 days of the operations of Wynn Macau and increases in Wynn Las Vegas expenses commensurate with the increase in revenues.  

In addition, on January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payments, using the modified prospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $15.4 million of share based compensation expense which is included in the department of the recipient of the stock based award. Prior to January 1, 2006, we did not recognize expense for employee stock options that were granted at the market price. See our Consolidated Financial Statements Note 15 Benefit Plans for more information.  

Pre-opening costs  

Pre-opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $62.7 million compared to $96.9 million for the prior year. Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006, accounted for $60.5 million of the current year pre-opening costs while the balance relates primarily to Encore. Pre-opening costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 related primarily to Wynn Las Vegas which opened on April 28, 2005 and Wynn Macau. We expect that as Encore progresses, pre-opening expenses related to this project will increase as the opening approaches.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $175.5 million increased by $72.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to including a full year for Wynn Las Vegas and an additional 117 days of operations of Wynn Macau. Wynn Las Vegas only recorded 248 days of depreciation in 2005.  

During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets.  

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation for long-lived assets related to Wynn Macau is charged generally over shorter useful lives when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.

Contract Termination Fee  

In February 2006, we agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive Las Vegas run at Wynn Las Vegas Broadway Theater at the end of May 2006. To terminate the contract, we paid a termination fee of $5 million. This fee was recorded in the first quarter of 2006.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $25.1 million increased by $10.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.  

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2006. Costs relating to assets retired as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $14.4 million have been expensed as property charges. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar, improved public baccarat space and private baccarat salons and converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories at Wynn Las Vegas.  

We expect that enhancements and refinements to Wynn Macau will take place in response to reactions from our customers in that market. Accordingly, we expect that Company property charges may increase in future periods.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest and other income of $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $18.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances compared to 2005, as well as interest earned on the PBL proceeds.  

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest of $29.5 million was $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $102.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $50 million for the same period in 2005. This increase is due to the increase in our borrowings in Macau, slightly higher interest rates and the $20.5 million decrease in interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau opened.  

Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). On August 15, 2006, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs senior credit facilities (See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancing Activities), we terminated a $200 million notional amount interest rate swap relating to Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs senior credit facilities. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as non-operating income or expense in each period. We recorded approximately $1.2 million of interest rate swap income for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 (December 31, 2005 to August 15, 2006 in the case of the terminated swap). During the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded a gain of $8.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Part II- Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Loss from extinguishment of debt totaled $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. On August 15, 2006 we refinanced our Wynn Las Vegas senior credit facilities as discussed in further detail below (See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancing Activities). As a result of the refinancing and resulting modification of the Term Loan, we recorded a loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31,

 2006 of approximately $10.8 million to reflect the write-off of the previous Term Loans unamortized deferred financing costs. In addition, on November 1, 2006, we redeemed the remaining approximate $10.1 million of our Second Mortgage Notes and incurred a $1.7 million redemption premium which is also included as loss from extinguishment of debt.  

On November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $6.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, we made a payment to the holders of our Debentures so that they participated in the distribution as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock prior to the record date. We paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount, or $58.5 million in total. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price as a result of the cash distribution. The payment was recorded as a distribution to convertible debenture holders in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Gain on sale of subconcession right  

On March 4, 2006, we entered into an agreement with Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (PBL) pursuant to which we agreed to sell to PBL for $900 million, the right to negotiate with the government of Macau for a subconcession to allow PBL to operate casinos in Macau.  

On September 8, 2006, the government of Macau approved the subconcession and on September 11, 2006, PBL paid $900 million in cash to Wynn Macau, S.A. for the subconcession right. As a result of the sale and the subconcession awarded to PBL by the government of Macau, we have no continuing rights or obligations with respect to the subconcession. All rights and obligations under the subconcession are between PBL and the government of Macau. The proceeds from this sale, net of related costs, are recorded as gain on sale of subconcession right, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Income Taxes  

For the year ended December 31, 2006, our effective tax rate was approximately 21.3%. This rate was lower than the federal statutory rate due to the reduction of our valuation allowance in connection with the sale of the PBL subconcession right and a reduced effective tax rate on our foreign operations (see footnote 17 Income Taxes). There were no comparable items in 2005 as we had not yet reached a conclusion that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets were realizable.  

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $4.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flow from Operations  

Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our operating income generated by Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, interest paid, and non-cash charges included in operating income. Net cash provided from operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $659.2 million compared to $240.8 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase is due to the full year of operations at Wynn Macau and improved results at Wynn Las Vegas, especially in the casino department.

Capital Resources  

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. Our cash balances at December 31, 2007 included approximately $500 million remaining from the $900 million cash received from the sale of our subconcession on September 11, 2006 and $350 million borrowed under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan Facility on December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations, new development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, and to support the development and construction of Encore and Wynn Diamond Suites. Of this amount, approximately $402.3 million is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, we have availability under our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau credit facilities as noted below under Financing Activities.  

At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $531.1 million in cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings, which is restricted for the following:  

       Construction, development and pre-opening expenses of Encore;  

       $30 million restricted for the Encore completion guarantee; and,  

       $500 million restricted for repurchases of our common stock.  

Cash equivalents include investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short-term, government-backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing our debt facilities.  

Investing Activities  

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas  

On April 28, 2006, we commenced construction on Encore. We expect to open Encore in December 2008. Design and construction is progressing as expected at Encore. Current construction activities in the various project sections include the following:  

       The concrete floor slabs and structural steel are complete for the hotel tower.  

       Exterior glass installation is 95% complete.  

       The furniture and equipment installation is complete up to the 6th floor.  

       The low-rise casino concrete pours and the structural steel are complete.  

       Drywall is 80% complete in the convention area and 20% complete in the casino level, spa level, and back of house.  

       Taxi and valet tunnels are 60% complete and exterior enclosure of the entire low rise is 80% complete.  

Our project budget is approximately $2.2 billion, consisting of approximately $2.1 billion for Encore and approximately $100 million for an employee parking garage on our Koval property, an associated pedestrian bridge and costs incurred in connection with the remodeling of the Broadway Theater and production of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas. The project is being funded from our Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities, operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas and proceeds from the $400 million addition to the Wynn Las Vegas First Mortgage Notes completed in November 2007. To the extent additional funds are required, we will provide these amounts with additional debt and equity contributions by Wynn Resorts or additional indebtedness to be incurred by Wynn Las Vegas.  

On February 27, 2007, we entered into a Design Build Architectural, Engineering and Construction Services Agreement (the Contract) with Tutor-Saliba Corporation (Tutor) for the design and construction of Encore. The Contract sets forth all of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Tutor will design and construct Encore.   

46  

Table of Contents 

 In June 2007, we executed the first amendment to the Contract which set the guaranteed maximum price for work under the Contract at $1.3 billion. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Contract, Tutor and the Ronald N. Tutor Separate Trust (the Trust) have entered into and consented to a Net Worth Agreement pursuant to which (x) the Trust agreed that it will retain its current majority holdings of Tutor and (y) the Trust and Tutor agreed that during the term of the Contract, Tutor will maintain (i) net worth of at least $100 million, and (ii) liquid assets of at least $50 million. As of December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately $998.7 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore and related capital improvements.  

The ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority:  

       First, by using agreed amounts of excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and the remaining proceeds from the $400 million addition to the First Mortgage Notes completed in November 2007;  

       Second, by using the proceeds of borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities; and,  

       Third, by using the funds from the completion guarantee deposit account.  

Wynn Las Vegas  

In response to our evaluation of Wynn Las Vegas and the reactions of our guests, we continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to the property. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities, we were permitted to make up to $172.2 million of capital expenditures in 2007, of which we expended approximately $60.1 million. For 2008, the limit under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities is $272.1 million. The spending limit may be increased to the extent funds are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas by Wynn Resorts, Limited.  

Wynn Macau  

Wynn Macau was completed and the casino resort opened on September 6, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we completed an expansion of Wynn Macau which included additional gaming space, and additional food, beverage and retail amenities. In addition to the gaming and retail facilities that opened in the expansion referenced above, Wynn Macau opened its rotunda area which features a gold prosperity tree in conjunction with a Chinese zodiac-inspired ceiling level show incorporating a descending chandelier. In September 2007, we opened approximately 20,000 square feet of gaming space and one restaurant at Wynn Macau. The remaining portion of the expansion opened in December 2007. With the full completion of the expansion, Wynn Macau now has a total of approximately 380 table games and 1,270 slot machines in approximately 205,000 square feet of gaming space. Wynn Macau and its recently opened expansion were completed at a cost of $1.1 billion.  

As at Wynn Las Vegas, in response to our evaluation of Wynn Macau and the reactions of our guests, we continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to this property. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements.  

Wynn Diamond Suites  

In June 2007, we commenced construction on Wynn Diamond Suites, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We expect Wynn Diamond Suites to open in the first half of 2010.  

Design of the project continues to progress and current construction activities include the following:  

       The pylons and diaphragm walls for the foundation are complete.  

       Pouring of the ground floor slab has commenced.  

47  

Table of Contents 

While the completed project budget is still being finalized, we expect total costs to be approximately $600 million. The project budget will be funded from our existing Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and cash flow from operations at Wynn Macau.  

In July 2007, Wynn Macau S.A. issued a notice to proceed and on November 8, 2007, executed a guaranteed maximum price contract for $347.8 million with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as the general contractor for the construction of the Wynn Diamond Suites. As of December 31, 2007, we have incurred approximately $53 million of project cost related to the development and construction of Wynn Diamond Suites.  

Financing Activities  

Wynn Resorts, Limited  

On June 7, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion which may include purchases of both our common stock and our 6% Convertible Debentures due 2015. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. These repurchases are included within the scope of our overall repurchase program discussed above. As of December 31, 2007, we had repurchased 1,889,321 shares of our common stock through open market purchases for a net cost of $179.3 million, at an average price of $94.89 per share.  

On June 15, 2007, we announced that we had called for redemption on July 20, 2007, all of the outstanding principal amount of our 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015 (the Debentures). Prior to redemption, in July 2007 all of the holders converted their Debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $23 per share (a conversion rate of approximately 43.4782 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures). Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares. As a result, in July 2007, $224.1 million principal amount of the Debentures were converted into 9,744,680 shares of our common stock. Accordingly long-term debt was reduced by $224.1 million, equity was increased by $218.9 million, and deferred financing costs were reduced by approximately $5.2 million.  

On June 21, 2007, we entered into a $1 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan). Borrowings under the Term Loan are available in the form of a delayed-draw term loan facility available through December 31, 2007, with the option to increase the facility to $1.25 billion if certain conditions are met. As of December 31, 2007, we borrowed $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility and no additional amounts are available. The Term Loan will mature and be payable on June 21, 2010. The Term Loan was available to fund (a) our equity repurchase program announced on June 7, 2007 and (b) up to $350 million for general corporate purposes. Of the $1 billion drawn, $500 million has been included as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 as such amount may only be used to fund our equity repurchases.  

Loans under the Term Loan accrue interest at our election of LIBOR or a Base Rate, plus a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of nine months or longer. Base Rate loans bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its prime rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on Base Rate loans are payable quarterly in arrears. The borrowing margin is 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1% for Base Rate loans, if our net liquidity is equal to or greater than $400 million and 2.50% for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans, if our net liquidity is less than $400 million. For borrowings under the Term Loan, we expect to elect interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% on the outstanding balance. We incurred a fee of 112.5 bps per annum of the actual daily amount by which the actual Term Loan commitment exceeded the outstanding amount of the Term Loan.  

48  

Table of Contents 

On October 3, 2007, we completed a secondary common stock offering of 4,312,500 shares with net proceeds of $154 per share or $664.1 million.  

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore  

As of December 31, 2007, our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities consist of a $900 million revolving credit facility (the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver) and $225 million term loan facility (the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan) ( together the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities). For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, Eurodollar loans which bear interest at the 1-month LIBOR and include a margin of 1.875% on that outstanding balance. We have a $200 million notional amount interest rate swap to essentially fix the interest on $200 million of the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan at the rate of 5.7% per annum. (For further information, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk.)  

As of December 31, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We do have $16.7 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. Consequently, $883.3 million remains available under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver for future borrowings for the construction of Encore or for other uses as necessary. For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver, we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at the 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.625% on the outstanding balance. After opening Encore, the margin will fluctuate between a range of 1 to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, an annual rate of 0.375% on the daily average of unborrowed availability. After the opening of Encore, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability based on our leverage ratio and will range from an annual rate of 0.25% to 0.50%.  

The $900 million Wynn Las Vegas Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on August 15, 2011. The Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan will mature in two installments: $112.5 million will be payable on September 30, 2012 and the remaining $112.5 million will be payable on August 15, 2013.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.  

In April 2007, we amended the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities to: (a) have the Final Completion as defined, be deemed satisfied for Wynn Las Vegas with the resulting release of (i) all amounts in excess of $30 million from the Completion Guaranty Deposit Account, ($24.6 million), and (ii) the balance of funds in the Project Liquidity Reserve Account ($32.8 million), (b) increase the permitted expenditures for Encore from $300 million to $500 million prior to the execution of a guaranteed maximum price construction contract, and (c) permit the issuance of up to $500 million of unsecured debt as and when permitted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes.  

In October 2007, we further amended the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities to (a) permit the issuance of up to $500 million of secured indebtedness, in lieu of the $500 million unsecured indebtedness in the April 2007 amendment, (b) remove certain language related to the inter-company loan made by Wynn Las Vegas to Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. and (c) amend certain provisions governing Wynn Las Vegas insurance related obligations. Also in October, 2007, pursuant to the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities, Wynn Las Vegas entered into a pre-agreed upon form of Amended and Restated Master Disbursement Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as Bank Agent and Disbursement Agent.

Table of Contents 

On November 6, 2007, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (the issuers), each a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited, issued, in a private offering, $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 at a price of 97.25% of the principal amount (the Additional Notes). The Additional Notes were issued under the same indenture as the previously issued 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes. The Additional Notes rank pari passu with, and will vote on any matter submitted to noteholders with, the previously issued 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes. The Additional Notes are senior secured obligations of the issuers, are guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries (subject to some exceptions), and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the issuers and guarantors.  

The Additional Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or under any state securities laws. Therefore, we may not offer or sell the Additional Notes within the United States to, or for the account or benefit of, any United States person unless the offer or sale would qualify for a registration exemption from the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We have agreed to make an offer to exchange the Additional Notes for registered, publicly traded notes that have substantially identical terms as the notes.  

$32.5 Million Note Payable for Aircraft  

On May 10, 2007, World Travel G-IV, LLC., a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a $32.5 million term loan credit facility to finance the purchase of an aircraft. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.15% and will mature on August 10, 2012. Principal and interest payments are made quarterly beginning July 1, 2007. Principal payments are approximately $542,000, with a balloon payment of $21.1 million due at maturity.  

Wynn Macau  

On June 27, 2007, Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A., amended its credit facilities, dated September 14, 2005 (Amended Common Terms Agreement), and entered into other related amendments and agreements with a syndicate of lenders. The Amended Common Terms Agreement and related agreements took effect on June 29, 2007 and expand availability under Wynn Macau, S.A.s existing senior bank facility from $764 million to $1.550 billion, in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars, including a $550 million equivalent fully funded senior term loan facility (the Wynn Macau Term Loan), and a $1 billion senior revolving credit facility (the Wynn Macau Revolver) (together the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to upsize the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement.  

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%.  

Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities will be used to complete the Wynn Diamond Suites, make investments in other projects in and around Macau and for general corporate purposes.  

As part of the amendment to the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, Wynn Resorts Limiteds remaining support obligations to Wynn Macau and $30 million in contingent equity previously provided by us has been released.  

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans.

$44.75 Million Note Payable Refinanced as $42 Million Note Payable  

On March 30, 2007, World Travel, LLC, a subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, refinanced the $44.75 million note payable. The new loan has a principal balance of $42 million and is due April 1, 2017. The loan is guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and secured by a first priority security interest in one of our aircraft. Principal and interest are due quarterly with a balloon payment of $28 million due at maturity. Interest is calculated at the 90-day LIBOR plus 125 basis points. In connection with this transaction, we incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $157,000 related to the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with the original loan.  

Cash Distributions  

On November 19, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $6.00 per share on our outstanding Common Stock. This distribution was paid on December 10, 2007 to stockholders of record on November 30, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, $686.1 million was recorded as a distribution in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. Of this amount approximately $3.3 million was recorded as a liability which will be paid to the holders of nonvested stock upon the vesting of that stock.  

On November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $6.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, we made a payment to the holders of its Debentures so that they participated in the distribution to the same extent as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock. We paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price as a result of the cash distribution. The total amount of the cash distribution was $669.8 million. This distribution was paid using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our subconcession in Macau as discussed above and corporate cash.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for straight forward interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $16.7 million.  

Contractual Obligation and Commitments  

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2007 (amounts in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2007.

Table of Contents 

 [2] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for an aircraft purchase, land concession and fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 17 Income Taxes, of this report, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, on January 1, 2007. We had $89.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign the liability as of December 31, 2007, to any particular years in the table.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our and our subsidiaries debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making dividends or distributions to us. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The other credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; although the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of subconcession sales.  

If completion of Encore is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening will increase correspondingly. Wynn Las Vegas will fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities. We cannot be sure, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under our Wynn Macau Credit Facility. However, we cannot be sure that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.  

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.  

Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions   

52  

Table of Contents 

 integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.  

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates  

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, significant start-up costs were incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through the second quarter of 2005 for Wynn Las Vegas and through the third quarter of 2006 for Wynn Macau, as anticipated. Once Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau opened, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts were no longer charged as pre-opening costs. However, start-up costs relating to Encore and Wynn Diamond Suites will continue to be charged to pre-opening costs until such projects are completed and opened.  

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are put in service. Upon the opening of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets.  

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.  

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to reflect the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on the majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau, however, commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss.  

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. However,

 the issuance of credit at Wynn Macau is less significant when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at Wynn Las Vegas are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.  

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement particularly burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.  

As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, approximately 65% and 59% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. The collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries.  

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.  

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable is due to a normal increase in casino accounts receivable outstanding over 180 days. While collection efforts remain active, it is our current policy to fully reserve all accounts over one year old. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, approximately 25% and 10% respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at Wynn Macau.  

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy or legal system occur.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable. As of December 31, 2007, we had three interest rate swaps with changes in the swap fair values being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Share-Based Compensation  

SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method and use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments issued. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company. In applying the modified prospective method, financial statements of prior periods presented do not reflect any adjusted amounts (i.e. prior periods do not include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method).  

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share-Based Payment to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).  

Significant Judgmental Accruals  

We estimate liabilities for certain self-insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as necessary.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we accumulated significant net operating losses, which generated significant deferred tax assets. Because of our limited operating history, we had previously fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. On September 11, 2006, we recorded a gain of $899.4 million on the sale of the subconcession right. Accordingly we determined that a substantial portion of these net deferred tax assets have become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109.  

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which we adopted on January 1, 2007. The Interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax   

55  

Table of Contents 

 position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. As a result, our income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by SFAS No. 5.  

FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. FIN 48s use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in SFAS No. 109 (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).  

The tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition is to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we will recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.  

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2007 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $26.4 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Our adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 will not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 (revised) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The revision is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under U.S. GAAP with international accounting rules. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 (revised) is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and for the deconsolidation of a   

56  

Table of Contents 

 subsidiary. It also clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amount attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosure that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and those of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
