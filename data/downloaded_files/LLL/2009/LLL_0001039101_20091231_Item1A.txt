Item 1A.    Risk Factors    

 You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any of these risks could materially affect our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could in turn materially affect the price of our common stock.  

 Our contracts (revenue arrangements) with U.S. Government customers entail certain risks.  

 A decline in or a redirection of the U.S. defense budget could result in a material decrease in our sales, earnings and cash flows.  

 Our government contracts are primarily dependent upon the U.S. defense budget. As is the case with most other U.S. defense contractors, we have benefited from the upward trend in DoD budget authorization and spending outlays over recent years, including supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Presidents DoD defense budget request, for the governments fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, excluding overseas contingencies operations supplemental requests, indicates continued growth over the fiscal year 2010 period, although at a slower pace. We expect future DoD budgets, including supplemental appropriations, to grow at a significantly slower pace than the past several years, and to possibly flatten. DoD budgets could be negatively affected by several factors, including events we cannot foresee, U.S. Government budget deficits, current or future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, U.S. national security strategies, a change in spending priorities, the cost of sustaining U.S. military and related security operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other locales around the world where U.S. military support may be pivotal, and other related exigencies and contingencies. While we are unable to predict the impact and outcome of these uncertainties, the effect of changes in these DoD imperatives could cause the DoD budget to remain unchanged or to decline (or even to increase). A significant decline in or redirection of U.S. military expenditures in the future could result in a decrease to our sales, earnings and cash flows. The loss or significant reduction in U.S. government funding of a large program in which we participate could also result in a decrease in our future sales, earnings and cash flows. U.S. Government contracts are also conditioned upon continuing approval by Congress of the amount of necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract periods of performance may extend over many years. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program,    

 19   
 the contract is usually partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. We believe that given the dangerous and volatile global condition in which the U.S. is a primary stabilizing force, our approach to future business planning will include our best assessments and judgments on how to account for change and adapt to new conditions and circumstances.  

 We rely predominantly on sales to U.S. Government entities, and the loss of a significant number of our contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  

 Our sales are predominantly derived from contracts (revenue arrangements) with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the U.S. Government. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to the U.S. Government would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 83%, or $13.1 billion, of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were made directly or indirectly to U.S. Government agencies, including the DoD. Aggregate sales from our five largest contracts (revenue arrangements) amounted to approximately $1.9 billion, or 12% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and included our Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) contract. Sales from the SOFSA contract were approximately $455 million, or 3% of our sales during 2009. On March 3, 2009, SOFSA announced that L-3 was not selected to perform on the follow-on contract. L-3 subsequently protested and, as a consequence, SOFSA has taken corrective action, which will include the issuance of a revised solicitation. Once a new solicitation is issued, proposals will be requested from all bidders. We were notified that a new solicitation will be issued in approximately April 2010, with an expected award date of January 2011. We may not succeed in the recompetition for the next SOFSA contract. We anticipate receiving funding on our current contract extending it from February 28, 2010 to the end of 2010, although we have not yet received the contract extension modification.  

 A substantial majority of our total sales are for products and services under contracts with various agencies and procurement offices of the DoD or with prime contractors to the DoD. Although these various agencies, procurement offices and prime contractors are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors, our customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. Because of this concentration of contracts, if a significant number of our DoD contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or cancelled for budgetary, performance or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  

 In addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, our backlog and future financial results may be adversely affected by:  

       curtailment of the U.S. Governments use of technology or other services and product providers, including curtailment due to government budget reductions and related fiscal matters;   

       developments in Iraq or Afghanistan, or other geopolitical developments that affect demand for our products and services;   

       our ability to hire and retain personnel to meet increasing demand for our services; and   

       technological developments that impact purchasing decisions or our competitive position.    

 Our government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification. If a termination right is exercised by the government, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

 Companies engaged primarily in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to certain business risks peculiar to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 20   
       audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and   

       control and potentially prohibit the export of our products and systems.    

 All of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.  

 U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate our costs and performance on contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including certain business acquisition costs, most financing costs, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be reimbursable under U.S. Government contracts.  

 The DoDs recent announcement to in-source contractor support services jobs by fiscal year 2014 could result in a material decrease in our sales, earnings and cash flows.  

 The U.S. Government has announced an initiative to reduce the role of private sector contractors currently performing support services jobs. As a part of this initiative, the U.S. Government intends by fiscal year 2014 to convert approximately 33,000 DoD support service jobs currently performed by the private sector to government positions. This initiative will primarily affect the businesses within the Government Services reportable segment and could result in the Company losing certain of its existing contracts (revenue arrangements) depending on how the DoD implements this initiative.  

 We may not be able to win competitively awarded contracts or receive required licenses to export our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.  

 Our government contracts are subject to competitive bidding. We obtain many of our U.S. Government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts. In addition, awarded contracts may not generate sales sufficient to result in our profitability. We are also subject to risks associated with the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In addition to these U.S. Government contract risks, we are not permitted to export some of our products and are also required to obtain licenses from U.S. Government agencies to export many of our products and systems. Failure to receive required licenses would eliminate our ability to sell our products and systems outside the United States.  

 We are subject to government investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

 We are from time to time subject to governmental investigations relating to our operations. We are currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations, including but not limited to, an investigation by the Department of Justice Criminal Antitrust Division regarding information technology services performed for the    

 21   
 U.S. Air Force. For a discussion of this matter, see the Titan Government Investigation in Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements on page F-46.  

 We are subject to the risks of current and future legal proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

 At any given time, we are a defendant in various material legal proceedings and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, claims and assessments that have been asserted against acquired businesses, which we have assumed. Although we maintain insurance policies, these policies may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims and these levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. A significant judgment against us, arising out of any of our current or future legal proceedings and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. For a discussion of the material litigation to which we are currently a party, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements on page F-46.  

 If we are unable to keep pace with rapidly evolving products and service offerings and technological change, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

 The rapid change of technology is a key feature of most of the markets in which our products, services and systems oriented businesses operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Historically, our technology has been developed through customer-funded and internally funded research and development and through certain business acquisitions. We may not be able to continue to maintain comparable levels of research and development or successfully complete such acquisitions. In the past, we have allocated substantial funds to capital expenditures, programs and other investments. This practice will continue to be required in the future. Even so, we may not be able to successfully identify new opportunities and may not have the necessary financial resources to develop new products and systems in a timely or cost-effective manner. At the same time, products and technologies developed by others may render our products, services and systems obsolete or non-competitive.  

 Our business acquisition strategy involves risks, and we may not successfully implement our strategy.  

 We opportunistically seek to acquire businesses that enhance our capabilities and add new technologies, products, services, programs, contracts, and customers to our existing businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we make additional business acquisitions, we may not realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions, including cost synergies and improving margins. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing for business acquisitions, since such additional financing could be restricted or limited by the terms of our debt agreements or due to unfavorable credit market conditions.  

 The process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Possible future business acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense and contingent liabilities, each of which could result in an increase to our already significant level of outstanding debt, as well as more restrictive covenants. On February 18, 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire all the outstanding common stock of a business for approximately $613 million. We anticipate completing this acquisition in the second quarter of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect to fund the purchase price with cash on hand. Although we have not entered into any other agreements with respect to any other business acquisition transaction at this time, we consider and may enter into business acquisitions on an ongoing basis and may be evaluating acquisitions or engaging in acquisition negotiations at any given time. Furthermore, in certain of our business acquisitions we have assumed all claims against and liabilities of the acquired business, including both asserted and unasserted claims and liabilities.   

 22   
 Goodwill represents a significant asset on our balance sheet. We review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also review goodwill annually in accordance with the accounting standards for goodwill and intangible assets. The annual impairment test is based on determining the fair value of our reporting units. A decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment, and a related non-cash impairment charge against earnings, if estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 39.  

 Our results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts.  

 Our sales are transacted using written revenue arrangements, or contracts, which are generally either fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material. For a description of our revenue recognition policies, see Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 39.  

 The table below presents the percentage of our total sales generated from each contract-type.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Substantially all of our cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts are with the U.S. Government, primarily the DoD. Substantially all of our sales to commercial customers are transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements, and are included in our fixed-price type contract sales.  

 On a fixed-price type contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract.  

 On a cost-plus type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contracts fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. On a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.  

 Additionally, the impact of revisions in profit or loss estimates for all types of contracts subject to percentage of completion accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as reduce the valuations of receivables and inventories; and in some cases, result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position.   

 23   
 Intense competition in the industries in which our businesses operate could limit our ability to attract and retain customers.  

 The defense industry and the other industries in which our businesses operate and the market for defense applications is highly competitive. We expect that the DoDs increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will continue to encourage new competitors to enter the market. We also expect that competition for original equipment manufacturing business will increase due to the continued emergence of merchant suppliers. Additionally, some of our competitors are larger than we are and have more financial and other resources than we have. For more information concerning the factors that affect our ability to compete, see Part I  Item 1  Business  Competition beginning on page 14.  

 Our significant level of debt and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or ability to incur additional debt.  

 At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $4,150 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt. In addition, at December 31, 2009, we had borrowing capacity of $968 million available to us under our new three-year $1 billion revolving credit facility that expires on October 23, 2012 (Revolving Credit Facility), after reductions of $32 million for outstanding letters of credit. In the future, we may increase our borrowings, subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Holders of our $700 million Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES) may require us to repurchase them in whole or in part at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and additional interest, if any) through the exercise of a put option on February 1, 2011. Furthermore, the first scheduled maturity of our existing debt is our $400 million 61/8% senior subordinated notes maturing on July 15, 2013. See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Debt on page 58.  

 Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to refinance our existing debt depends on our future financial performance as well as our ability to access the capital markets, and the relative attractiveness of available financing terms. We do not have complete control over our future financial performance because it is subject to economic, political, financial (including credit market conditions), competitive, regulatory and other factors affecting the aerospace and defense industry, as well as commercial industries in which we operate. It is possible that in the future our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If this situation occurs, we may have to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital. We may not be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms in accordance with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to us. These consequences may include:  

       requiring a substantial portion of our net cash flow from operations to be used to pay interest and principal on our debt and therefore be unavailable for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, paying dividends to our shareholders, repurchasing shares of our common stock, research and development and other investments;   

       limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, investments or other expenditures, which, in each case, may limit our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy;   

       increasing interest expenses due to higher interest rates on our Revolving Credit Facility as it has a variable interest rate;   

       heightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in the general economy and restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new technologies and products or exploiting business opportunities; and   

       impacting debt covenants that limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchase shares of our common stock. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.     

 24   
 Additionally, on December 31, 2009, we had $9,114 million of contractual obligations (including outstanding indebtedness). For a detailed listing of the components of our contractual obligations, see Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Obligations on page 60.  

 Our debt agreements restrict our ability to finance our future operations and, if we are unable to meet our financial ratios, could cause our existing debt to be accelerated.  

 Our debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 These restrictions could impair our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. In addition, some of our debt agreements also require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios, including (1) total consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to total consolidated cash interest expense, (2) total consolidated funded indebtedness less designated cash balances to total consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and (3) consolidated senior indebtedness less designated cash balances to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our ability to comply with these ratios and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these agreements or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or covenants could result in a default under those debt agreements. In the event of any such default, the lenders under those debt agreements could elect to:  

       declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees to be due and immediately payable;   

       require us to apply all of our available cash to repay our outstanding senior debt; and   

       prevent us from making debt service payments on our other debt.    

 For further discussion of our financial ratios, debt agreements and other payment restrictions, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements on page F-28.  

 If we are unable to attract and retain key management and personnel, we may become unable to operate our business effectively.  

 Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management, and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel, including employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly clearances of top-secret and above. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies for members of our management. We face competition for management and technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would damage our future prospects.  

 Environmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liability.  

 Our operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local as well as certain foreign environmental laws and regulations within the countries in which we operate relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations.   

 25   
 New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require us to incur a significant amount of additional costs in the future and could decrease the amount of cash flow available to us for other purposes, including capital expenditures, research and development and other investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

 Termination of our backlog of orders could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.  

 We currently have a backlog of funded orders, primarily under contracts with the U.S. Government. Our total funded backlog was $10,862 million at December 31, 2009. As described above, the U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or terminate its contracts with us. Accordingly, most of our backlog could be modified or terminated by the U.S. Government, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.  

 Our sales to certain foreign customers expose us to risks associated with operating internationally.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2009, sales to foreign customers, excluding our foreign sales made under foreign military sales (FMS) agreements directly between the U.S. Government and allied foreign governments, represented approximately 11% of our consolidated sales. Consequently, our businesses are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 While we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate.  

 Continued global economic weakness, diminished credit availability, and increasing U.S. Government budget deficits may materially and adversely affect our results.  

 Domestic and foreign economies have continued to show weakness, including limited credit availability for small businesses and other types of borrowers. Economic conditions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our sales to the commercial markets in which we operate, including our commercial aviation products and commercial shipbuilding products businesses. Sales to commercial customers were approximately $1.5 billion, or 10%, of our total sales in 2009 compared to approximately $1.7 billion, or 11% of our total sales in 2008.  

 Additionally, while we are unable to predict the impact and outcome of current or longer term economic conditions and the U.S. Governments intervention across several industries to assist in an economic recovery, these conditions could also negatively affect future U.S. defense budgets and spending, and consequently, our financial condition, results of    

 26   
 operations, cash flows and future prospects. Sales to the DoD represented 76% of our total sales in 2009 compared to 74% in 2008.  

 These economic conditions could also adversely affect our pension plan funded status and annual pension expense. See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Pension Plans on page 56 and Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements.
