ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS

In 2012, the U.S. economy advanced at a muted pace. U.S. recovery was hindered by slowing global growth as well as domestic issues which included the rising U.S. deficit and political uncertainty related to the fall elections. Continued uncertainty on the part of business and consumers limited investment and spending. These factors significantly affected the economy, limiting anticipated improvements in key economic indicators. The U.S. housing market, while affected by these factors, showed signs of improvement in 2012 as lower inventories of new and existing homes led to increases in construction and home values. The strength of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberlands segments. Real Estate focuses on building single-family homes. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.

HOUSING MARKET

We track certain indicators such as employment, consumer confidence, housing starts, home sales, foreclosures, home prices, mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions. The following market statements refer to industry conditions in general and not to Weyerhaeuser operations directly.

Total U.S. housing starts for 2012 were 781 thousand units, with single family units accounting for 535 thousand of the total. This represents a 23 percent increase in single family starts from 2011. Multifamily construction also increased in 2012 to 246 thousand units compared with 178 thousand in 2011. While a significant improvement, current housing demand remains well below 1 million or more single family starts, the typical level during the 15-year period of 1992-2007. In 2012, new home sales in the U.S. averaged 366 thousand units. This level represents a 19 percent increase over 2011, which had the lowest number of new home sales since 1963, when U.S. Census started reporting this data. Through much of 2012 the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent, but as of December had fallen to 7.8 percent, the lowest level for the year. Weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence, limiting much of the potential growth in demand for housing and wood products. The number of mortgages in default remains above historic (pre 2006 levels), but has fallen significantly since the peak in 2009. Although, this factor will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes for sale, it is diminishing in significance as the overall housing market continues to improve from the credit crisis and recession of 2009.

Demand for wood products has gradually improved as housing starts have increased. Overall demand levels for lumber increased 6 percent from 2011, with a similar 6 percent rise in the demand for structural panels. Despite the improvement, demand for both lumber and panels remain below peak levels. However, industry operating rates for lumber and structural panels have improved over 2011 and this has resulted in higher prices than those observed in 2011. Prices for most commodity wood products were higher in 2012, with the greatest increases in southern yellow pine lumber and oriented strand board (OSB). Demand for logs increased as lumber production increased. In the West, demand for logs was bolstered by demand from Japan, China and Korea, although demand from China is lower than in 2011. In the South, several years of deferred harvest due to weak demand have created increased inventories and as a result southern pine log prices were relatively flat in 2012.

U.S. DOLLAR/GLOBAL DEMAND

The U.S. dollar remained weak relative to many global currencies during 2012. However, the year was characterized by volatility in euro exchange rates as a result of the debt crisis in Eurozone countries. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro for much of 2012, which had a detrimental effect on Cellulose Fibers, as our pulp mills became less competitive against competitors with euro denominated costs. Additionally, the slowdown in the key global economies of Europe and China led to a slowdown in pulp demand, putting additional downward pressure on prices as operating rates worldwide moved lower. The key indicator, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp, fell to an average of $813/ton (delivered N Europe) in 2012. This was a 15 percent decline from 2011. Pulp prices started the first half of the year at $837/ton, which was lower than 2011, and fell below $800/ton in the third quarter.

Japan experienced an uptick in housing starts in 2012 with total housing starts in Japan increasing 5 percent from 2011 levels. Shipment of logs to Japan increased 6 percent over 2011. In 2012 the U.S. dollar yen exchange rate was comparable to 2011. However the yen began to weaken in the fourth quarter, making U.S. wood less affordable in yen terms. This was offset to some extent by the appreciating euro, which increased the cost of competing supplies from Europe into Japan. The export log market was affected by the slowdown in China's construction sector related to the overall slowdown in the Chinese economy. Chinese imports of softwood logs from the U.S. were lower than the same period in 2011, but above 2010 levels.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 31
WHERE WE ARE HEADED

Growth in the U.S. economy is estimated to be 2.2 percent for 2012 and the expectation is for slightly lower growth of 1.9 percent in 2013. The ongoing weak economic recovery from the recession of 2009 has limited job growth, and improvements in consumer confidence and spending. The U.S. is expected to add enough jobs to continue to lower the overall unemployment rate in 2013, but at a gradual pace. Single-family starts are expected to continue to increase in 2013, a result of improving demand for homes and low inventories of new and existing homes for sale. Demand for wood products is expected to increase as a result of greater demand for housing. Prices for wood products in 2013 are expected to be similar to 2012, although some prices may weaken as previously idled manufacturing capacity is restarted and inventories increase. Log prices in western markets are expected to rise slightly with improving export and domestic demand. In the South, log prices are expected to remain near current levels until increased demand decreases inventories. The U.S. dollar is expected to remain weak relative to developed currencies outside of the euro, which is expected to continue to be affected by uncertainty in the Eurozone. Weakness in global pulp demand and volatility in the euro are expected to continue and to limit improvement in commodity pulp prices.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) ELECTION

Starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. A significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment. We are, however, subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS), which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and our non-qualified timberland segment income. Following are points related to our conversion:

•To implement our decision to be taxed as a REIT, we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits, determined under federal income tax provisions, as a “Special Dividend.” On September 1, 2010, we paid a dividend of $5.6 billion which included the Special Dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately $11 million. At the election of each shareholder, the Special Dividend was paid in cash or Weyerhaeuser common shares. The aggregate amount of cash distributed was $560 million and the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million.

•The stock portion of the Special Dividend is treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings (loss) per share only for periods after the distribution. Prior periods are not restated. The required treatment results in earnings (loss) per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued.

•We reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities, which resulted in a benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010 of approximately $1,064 million. Our effective income tax rate also decreased beginning in 2010, due to lower taxes on REIT qualifying timberlands income.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

HOW WE DID IN 2012

Summary of Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $843 million — 14 percent — primarily due to the following:

• Wood Products segment sales increased $782 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes across all major product lines and improved selling prices for structural lumber, OSB and plywood.

• Real Estate segment sales increased $232 million, primarily due to the sale of a 3,200 acre master planned community in Houston, Texas, sale of commercial acreage and multi-family lots in southern California and increased home closings.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $204 million in Cellulose Fibers segment sales, primarily due to lower pulp price realizations.

Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased $54 million — 16 percent — primarily due to the following:

• a $355 million increase in gross margin from our Wood Products segment, primarily due to higher price realizations for lumber, OSB and plywood; 

•a $103 million pretax gain recognized in 2012 related to a postretirement plan amendment;

•charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments decreased $51 million; and

•a $48 million increase in gross margin from our Real Estate segment, primarily due to increased contributions from land and lot sales.

These increases in our earnings were partially offset by:

•a $240 million decrease in gross margin from our Cellulose Fibers segment, primarily due to lower pulp price realizations;

•a pretax gain of $152 million on the sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2011; and

•a $117 million increase in income taxes due to higher income in our TRS in 2012 compared to 2011, and lower tax benefits primarily due to foreign tax credits recognized in 2011.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $262 million — 4 percent — primarily due to the following:

• Timberlands segment sales increased $170 million, as a result of higher log prices and volumes sold;

• Cellulose Fibers segment sales increased $147 million, as a result of higher pulp prices and volumes sold; and

• Wood Products segment sales increased $52 million, as a result of increased volumes sold of structural lumber and OSB.

These increases were partially offset by an $85 million decrease in Real Estate segment sales, as a result of fewer home closings.

Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $950 million — 74 percent — primarily due to certain significant benefits in 2010 that were not repeated in 2011, including:

• a $1,064 million reversal of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our conversion to a REIT in 2010;

• a $149 million cellulosic biofuel producer credit in 2010;

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 34
• a pretax gain of $46 million on the sale of five short line railroads in 2010; and

• a pretax gain of $40 million on the sale of certain British Columbia forest licenses and associated rights in 2010.

These decreases in our earnings were partially offset by:

•a pretax gain of $152 million on the sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2011;

•a $76 million tax benefit related to foreign tax credits in 2011;

•a $68 million decrease in interest expense due to lower charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt and lower interest expense due to a lower level of debt;

•charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairments decreased $65 million, primarily due to decreased impairments recognized in our Wood Products segment; and

•a $49 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.

TIMBERLANDS

HOW WE DID IN 2012

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Timberlands.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers, intersegment sales, and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Timberlands 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net Sales and Revenues — Unaffiliated Customers

Net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $33 million — 3 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Southern log sales increased $37 million due to increased sales volumes of 14 percent and increased price realizations of 4 percent, as a result of increased harvest levels in response to increased third party demand.

•Sales from our international operations increased $20 million, primarily due to increased plywood prices of 16 percent and a 33 percent increase in plywood sales volumes.

•Western log sales increased by $14 million due to increased sales volumes of 12 percent, partially offset by lower export and domestic log prices.

The above items were partially offset by:

•a $22 million decrease in minerals, oil and gas revenue primarily due to lower natural gas prices; and

•a $21 million decrease in timberland exchanges.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 35
Intersegment Sales

Intersegment sales increased $37 million — 6 percent — primarily due to the following:

•a $23 million increase due to higher sales volumes in the West and South, partially offset by lower log prices in the South; and

•a $14 million increase due to increased Canadian log and chip sales volumes.

Net contribution to earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $169 million — 34 percent — primarily from:

•a $152 million decrease due to the sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2011;

•a $36 million decrease as the mix of export log sales compared to domestic log sales decreased in the West and both domestic and export log prices were lower in the West;

•a $22 million decrease in mineral income, primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices;

•a $15 million decrease due to fewer timberland exchanges and higher and better-use land sales; and

•a $12 million increase in operating costs in the West, primarily due to increased logging and maintenance costs.

The above items were partially offset by:

•a $46 million increase, primarily due to higher sales volumes and demand for domestic and export logs and an increase in harvest levels of 9 percent in the West and 18 percent in the South;

•a $10 million increase in earnings from our international operations, primarily due to higher plywood prices and sales volumes; and

•a $7 million increase due to higher log prices in the South.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net Sales and Revenues — Unaffiliated Customers

Net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $170 million — 19 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Western log sales increased by $131 million due to increased sales volumes of 18 percent and increased price realizations of 12 percent as a result of strong export demand.

•Southern log sales increased by $51 million due to increased sales volumes of 45 percent resulting from increased harvest levels and increased sales of logs to third parties.

•Sales from our International operations increased by $21 million, primarily due to increased plywood sales volumes of 34 percent.

The above items were partially offset by a decrease of $29 million in land exchanges and higher and better-use land sales.

Intersegment Sales

Intersegment sales increased 43 million — 7 percent — primarily from the following:

•a $28 million increase due to increased Canadian log and chip sales volumes and

•a $15 million increase due to higher log prices and sales volumes in the West partially offset by lower log prices and sales volumes in the South.

Net contribution to earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $209 million — 74 percent — primarily from the following:

•a $152 million pretax gain on the sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2011;

•a $77 million increase primarily due to higher domestic and export prices in the West; and

•a $59 million increase due to increased harvest levels of 18 percent in the West and 19 percent in the South.

These items were partially offset by:

•increased operating costs of $33 million, primarily due to higher fuel and silviculture costs;

•a $23 million decrease due to fewer land exchanges and higher and better-use land sales; and

•a $20 million decrease due to lower prices for logs in the South.

OUR OUTLOOK FOR FIRST QUARTER 2013

Excluding dispositions of non-strategic timberlands, we expect earnings from the segment to be comparable to fourth quarter. We anticipate improved selling prices for Western domestic and export logs, offset by a seasonal decline in Southern fee harvest volumes. Earnings from dispositions of non-strategic timberlands are expected to decrease.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 36
WOOD PRODUCTS

HOW WE DID IN 2012

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Wood Products business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Wood Products.

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Wood Products

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Overall performance in our Wood Products segment significantly improved year over year. We continue to focus on reducing costs and increasing revenues by broadening our customer base; introducing new products; growing our specialty, as well as commodity building products business; and improving our operational capabilities. These improvement efforts and better market conditions resulted in higher production rates in all primary product lines.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $782 million — 34 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Structural lumber shipment volumes increased 12 percent and average price realizations increased 15 percent.

•OSB shipment volumes increased 27 percent and average price realizations increased 36 percent.

•Engineered solid section shipment volumes increased 25 percent.

•Engineered I-joints shipment volumes increased 19 percent.

•Softwood plywood shipment volumes increased 37 percent and average price realizations increased 28 percent.

•Other products produced increased 18 percent.

•Other products purchased for resale increased 28 percent.

The above items were partially offset by a decrease of 6 percent in engineered solid section average price realizations.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $388 million primarily from:

•a $363 million increase as higher lumber, OSB and plywood price realizations more than offset lower prices for engineered I-joists and engineered solid section:

•a $58 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments;

•a $25 million loss from discontinued operations included in 2011 earnings; and

•a $23 million increase in sales volumes across all products.

These changes were partially offset by a $51 million increase in freight expense due to higher shipment volumes.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

During 2011, we recognized $29 million of impairment charges in the Wood Products segment primarily related to the decision to permanently close four engineered lumber facilities that had been previously indefinitely closed. These facilities are located in Albany, Oregon; Dodson, Louisiana; Pine Hill, Alabama; and Simsboro, Louisiana. Total restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges in 2011 for the segment were $64 million. This compares with total Wood Products restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges of $114 million in 2010.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased $52 million — 2 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Structural lumber average price realizations decreased 3 percent as a result of:

– An 11 percent decrease in southern yellow pine realizations. In 2011, southern yellow pine accounted for 50 percent of the sales volume from our sawmills.

– This was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in Douglas fir realizations.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 37
•OSB average price realizations decreased 13 percent.

•Engineered solid section shipment volumes decreased 6 percent.

•Engineered I-joints shipment volumes decreased 12 percent.

•Other products purchased for resale decreased primarily as a result of ceasing to offer a composite decking product line.

These items were partially offset by the following:

•Structural lumber shipment volumes increased 7 percent.

•OSB shipment volumes increased 28 percent, primarily due to the re-opening of our Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan facility. 

•Engineered I-joists average price realizations increased 7 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $40 million — 13 percent — primarily from:

•a $83 million decrease in manufacturing costs, primarily due to increased operating rates;

•selling and general administrative costs decreased $58 million, primarily due to previous cost reduction efforts;

•charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments decreased $49 million; and

•an increase in by-product sales of $32 million.

These changes were partially offset by the following:

•a $66 million decrease due to lower sales price realizations, primarily for OSB and structural lumber;

•freight expense increased $43 million due to higher fuel cost and increasing shipments of OSB and structural lumber;

•a $40 million pretax gain was recognized in 2010 on the sale of certain British Columbia forest licenses and associated rights;

•a $33 million increase in charges related to the sale of our hardwoods operations; and

•log costs increased $16 million as domestic prices increased in the West as a result of strong export demand.

OUR OUTLOOK FOR FIRST QUARTER 2013

We anticipate significantly higher earnings from the Wood Products segment in first quarter. We expect increased average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board and seasonally higher sales volumes across all product lines. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to decline due to improved operating rates, partially offset by higher raw material costs.

CELLULOSE FIBERS

HOW WE DID IN 2012 

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Cellulose Fibers business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Cellulose Fibers.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Cellulose Fibers

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011 

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased $204 million — 10 percent — primarily due to:

•Pulp price realizations decreased $108 per ton — 12 percent — resulting from weak global economies and a weak euro. The effect of the price decrease was partially offset by an improved sales mix to higher valued products.

•Sales volumes for liquid packaging board decreased 8,000 tons — 3 percent as the result of weaker demand in Japan.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $229 million — 51 percent — primarily due to:

•a $190 million decrease due to lower pulp price realizations, partially offset by an improved sales mix to higher value products; and

•a $35 million increase in chemical, freight, warehousing and other operating costs.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 38
COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010 

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $147 million — 8 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Pulp price realizations increased $52 per ton — 6 percent — primarily due to lower global softwood pulp inventories in the first half of the year and a change in sales mix to higher valued products.

•Sales volumes for pulp increased 42,000 tons — 2 percent.

•Liquid packaging board price realizations increased $82 per ton — 8 percent — due to a favorable shift in product mix to coated board sales and an increase in market price.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $31 million — 7 percent — primarily from:

•a $92 million increase due to higher pulp price realizations;

•a $24 million improvement in liquid packaging board price realizations; and

•a $13 million increase in other non operating income, which includes earnings from an equity affiliate.

Partially offsetting these increases in earnings was:

•a $57 million increase, primarily due to rising fiber and chemical costs;

•a $33 million increase in operating costs, maintenance, freight, energy and the effect on Canadian operating costs of the weakening U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar; and

•a $12 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs. 

OUR OUTLOOK FOR FIRST QUARTER 2013

We expect lower earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in first quarter. We anticipate increased maintenance expenses, partially offset by slightly higher average selling prices for pulp.

REAL ESTATE

HOW WE DID IN 2012

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Real Estate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $232 million — 28 percent — primarily due to:

•Single-family housing revenues increased $102 million. Home closings increased 21 percent to 2,314 in 2012 from 1,912 in 2011. The average price of homes closed declined 6 percent to $376,000 in 2012 from $402,000 in 2011.

•Revenues from land and lot sales increased $126 million. 2012 included the sale of a 3,200 acre master planned community in Houston, Texas and the sale of commercial acreage and multi-family lots in southern California.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $47 million — 81 percent — primarily due to:

•a $54 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales; and

•an $8 million decrease in charges for impairments and restructuring.

These improvements were partially offset by the following:

•a $7 million increase in selling expenses, primarily due to volume related increases in sales and marketing costs; and

•a $7 million decrease in income from loss reserves for adjustments for settled matters. 

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 39
Net contribution from single-family housing was comparable year-over-year. Improvements from the higher volume of closings was offset by the decrease in the average price of homes closed and lower single-family gross margins. Average single-family gross margins were 20.7 percent in 2012 compared to 23.3 percent in 2011.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased $85 million — 9 percent — primarily due to:

•Home closings declined 10 percent to 1,912 in 2011 from 2,125 in 2010.

•Revenues from land and other sales decreased $11 million.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $33 million — 36 percent — primarily due to:

•a $33 million decrease in contribution from the sale of partnership interests — first quarter 2010 included the sale

of interests in two commercial partnerships;

•a $25 million decrease — 12 percent — in contribution from single-family operations, primarily due to fewer home closings; and

•a $9 million decrease in contribution from partnerships interests.

These decreases were partially offset by the following improvements:

•a $16 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as the result of lower closing volumes and ongoing cost reduction efforts;

•an $11 million increase related to contingent loss reserves – 2011 included net income from reserve adjustments for settled matters compared to net charges in 2010; and

•a $10 million decrease in impairments and restructuring charges.

OUR OUTLOOK FOR FIRST QUARTER 2013

We anticipate a slight profit from single-family homebuilding in first quarter. Home closings should decline seasonally to approximately 500 homes, with margins comparable to fourth quarter. Selling expenses are expected to decrease due to lower closing volume.

UNALLOCATED ITEMS

Unallocated Items are gains or charges not related to or allocated to an individual operating segment. They include a portion of items such as: share-based compensation, pension and postretirement costs, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses associated with financing, and the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and the LIFO reserve.

Net Contribution to Earnings for Unallocated Items

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other Unallocated Items in 2012 included a gain of $103 million related to a postretirement plan amendment.

Changes in Unallocated pension and postretirement credits (costs) in 2011 compared to 2010 were primarily due to an increase of $100 million due to the amortization of deferred pension losses. We amortize the cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses—generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year—over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans. Unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses arise primarily from differences between our expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return in a particular year and changes in actuarial assumptions. See Note 8: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Other Unallocated Items in 2010 included a gain on the sale of five short line railroads of $46 million.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 40
INTEREST EXPENSE

Our net interest expense incurred for the last three years was:

•$348 million in 2012,

•$384 million in 2011 and

•$452 million in 2010.

Reductions in our amount of outstanding debt was:

•$187 million in 2012,

•$583 million in 2011 and

•$26 million in 2011 and

•$50 million in 2010.

INCOME TAXES

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years was:

•$55 million in 2012,

•$(62) million in 2011 and

•$(1,192) million in 2010.

During 2012, we recorded the following tax benefits or charges:

•a $36 million tax charge related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment and

•a $12 million tax benefit related to income tax settlements.

During 2011, we recorded the following tax benefits or charges:

•a $76 million tax benefit related to foreign tax credits associated with the repatriation of Canadian earnings,

•a $57 million tax charge resulting from the sale of non-strategic timberlands and

•a $10 million tax benefit due to the early extinguishment of debt.

During 2010, we recorded the following tax benefits or charges:

•We reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our conversion to a REIT, which resulted in a benefit of $1,064 million.

•We recorded a tax benefit of $149 million for cellulosic biofuel producer credits; see “Fuel Credits” for more information.

•We recorded a $32 million tax charge as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act and a change in our postretirement medical plan.

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate level tax on income of the REIT that is distributed to shareholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRS, which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and the portion of our timberlands segment income included in the TRS.

The table below summarizes the historical tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:

•protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and

•have access at all times to major financial markets.

CASH FROM OPERATIONS

Cash from operations includes:

•cash received from customers;

•cash paid to employees, suppliers and others;

•cash paid for interest on our debt; and

•cash paid or received for taxes.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 41
Consolidated net cash provided by our operations was:

•$581 million in 2012,

•$291 million in 2011 and

•$689 million in 2010.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net cash provided by operations increased $290 million in 2012 as compared with 2011:

•Cash we received from customers in our Wood Products and Real Estate segments increased $931 million, primarily due to increased sales and cash received of $120 million for land and lot sales. 

•Cash paid for interest decreased $69 million, primarily due to the early retirement of $518 million of debt in 2011. We paid interest of $351 million in 2012 compared to $420 million in 2011.

•Net cash inflows related to income taxes increased $41 million. We received income tax refunds of $13 million in 2012 and paid $28 million in 2011.

Partially offsetting these increases were:

•Cash paid to employees, suppliers and others increased $638 million in our Wood Products and Real Estate segments due to increased production.

•Cash we received from customers in our Cellulose Fibers segment decreased $129 million due to decreased sales.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net cash provided by operations decreased $398 million in 2011 as compared with 2010:

•Cash paid to employees, suppliers and others increased $517 million in our Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments due to increased production rates in our Timberlands and Wood Products segments and higher production costs in our Cellulose Fibers segment.

•Net cash inflows related to income taxes decreased $481 million. We paid taxes of $28 million in 2011 and received $453 million in 2010.

Partially offsetting the above decreases were:

•Cash we received from customers in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments increased $356 million, primarily due to increased sales.

•Pension and postretirement contributions decreased $137 million, primarily due to a contribution of approximately $150 million to our U.S. qualified pension plans in 2010. These contributions were $143 million in 2011 compared to $280 million in 2010.

•Cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $86 million in our Real Estate segment due to fewer home closings.

Fuel Credits

In 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor sold or used in 2009 qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit. Black liquor potentially qualifies for either the cellulosic biofuel producer credit or the alternative fuel mixture credit (but not both on the same gallon of black liquor). During 2009, we produced approximately 238 million gallons of black liquor, which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit. This equals $240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel producer credit at $1.01 per gallon, or $149 million net of tax, which we recognized in fourth quarter 2010. 

Pension Contributions and Benefit Payments Made and Expected 

During 2012, we:

•contributed $89 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans in accordance with minimum funding rules and respective provincial regulations; 

•made benefit payments of $21 million related to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans; and

•made benefit payments of $35 million related to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

Congress passed legislation in June 2012 that changed the way the discount rate is computed for purposes of determining minimum pension contribution funding. Based upon this legislation, we did not have a required contribution to our U.S. qualified plan in 2012.

During 2013, based on estimated year-end assets and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to:

•be required to contribute approximately $88 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans;

•make benefit payments of $19 million related to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans; and

•make benefit payments of $37 million related to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

We do not anticipate making a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan for 2013.

INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS

Cash from investing activities includes:

•acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation;

•investments in or distribution from equity affiliates;

•proceeds from sale of assets and operations; and

•purchases and redemptions of short-term investments.

The pension trust repaid net amounts of $146 million in 2010 of short-term loans made in 2008 and 2009.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 42
Three-Year Summary of Capital Spending by Business Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We anticipate that our net capital expenditures for 2013 — excluding acquisitions — will be approximately $285 million. However, that amount could change due to:

•future economic conditions,

•environmental regulations,

•weather and

•timing of equipment purchases.

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF NONSTRATEGIC ASSETS

Proceeds received from the sale of nonstrategic assets over the last three years were:

•$80 million in 2012 for the sale of various non-strategic assets.

•$362 million in 2011 including:

– $192 million for the sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in southwestern Washington;

– $84 million for the sale of our hardwoods operations (we expect to receive an additional $25 million plus interest in 2016 from a note receivable);

– $58 million for the sale of our Westwood Shipping Lines operations; and

– $28 million for the sale of other non-strategic assets.

•$213 million in 2010 including:

– $66 million for the sale of Wood Products assets,

– $52 million for the sale of five short line railroads,

– $40 million for the sale of British Columbia forest licenses and associated rights in our Wood Products segment,

– $33 million for the sale of partnership interests in our Real Estate segment and

– $22 million for the sale of other non-strategic assets.

Discontinued operations are discussed in Note 3: Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCING

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:

•historical experience and

•assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:

•pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•potential impairments of long-lived assets; and

•legal, environmental and product liability reserves.

Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:

•discount rates,

•expected long-term rate of return,

•anticipated trends in health care costs,

•assumed increases in salaries and

•mortality rates.

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:

•actual pension fund performance,

•level of lump sum distributions,

•plan changes,

•changes in plan participation or coverage and

•portfolio changes and restructuring.

This section provides more information about our:

•expected long-term rate of return and

•discount rates.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return 

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. 

Over the 28 years it has been in place, our U.S. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 14.8 percent net compound annual return rate.

After considering available information at the end of 2012, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.0 percent. Factors we considered include:

•the net compounded annual return of 11.5 percent achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy the past 10 years and

•current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$21 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 46
Discount Rates 

Our discount rates as of December 31, 2012, are:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2013 will be based on the 3.7 percent and 3.0 percent assumed discount rates for U.S. plans and 4.1 percent and 4.0 percent assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.

Our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$26 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our financial statements.

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets.

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:

•future cash flows,

•residual values and

•fair values of the assets.

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:

•probability of alternative outcomes,

•product pricing,

•raw material costs,

•product sales and

•discount rate.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: REAL ESTATE

We review homebuilding long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. 

Real Estate In Process of Development and Land Being Processed for Development

Real estate in process of development and land being processed for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities (MPCs). MPCs typically include several product segments such as residential, active adult, retail and commercial. We evaluate impairment at the subdivision or MPC product segment level. Factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or MPC product segment for impairment include:

•gross margins and selling costs on homes closed in recent months;

•projected gross margins and selling costs based on our operating budgets;

•competitor pricing and incentives in the same or nearby communities; and

•trends in average selling prices, discounts, incentives, sales velocity and cancellations.

We update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and MPC product segment that may be impaired. The undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by community-specific factors that include:

•estimates and timing of future revenues;

•estimates and timing of future land development, materials, labor and contractor costs;

•community location and desirability, including availability of schools, retail, mass transit and other services;

•local economic and demographic trends regarding employment, new jobs and taxes;

•competitor presence, product types, future competition, pricing, incentives and discounts; and

•land availability, number of lots we own or control, entitlement restrictions and alternative uses.

The carrying amount of each subdivision and MPC product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or MPC product segment. An impairment charge for a subdivision or MPC product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot.

Real Estate for Sale

Real estate for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell. We regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans.

The carrying amount of real estate for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount. The fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions, demographic factors and competitor actions, and is inherently uncertain. Actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates. The carrying amount of real estate for sale is evaluated quarterly.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2012 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 47
Market Approach

We use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate assets when information for comparable assets is available. This approach is commonly used for completed inventory and individual assets for sale. We typically use:

•sales prices for comparable assets,

•market studies,

•appraisals or

•legitimate offers.

Income Approach

We generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects and assets in process of development. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

We record contingent liabilities when:

•it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and

•the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:

•historical experience,

•judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and

•recommendations of legal counsel.

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.

While we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. See Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Currently there are no significant prospective accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on us.
