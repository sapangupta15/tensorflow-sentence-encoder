PART I  

ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

General  

Danaher Corporation (Danaher, Company, we, us, our) designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, industrial and commercial products and services, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, innovative technology and major market positions. Our research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service and administrative facilities are located in more than 50 countries. Our business consists of five segments: Test & Measurement; Environmental; Life Sciences & Diagnostics; Dental; and Industrial Technologies.  

We strive to create shareholder value through:  

       delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for our products and services;  

       upper quartile financial performance compared to our peer companies; and  

       upper quartile cash flow generation from operations compared to our peer companies.  

To accomplish these goals, we use a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (DBS), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Within the DBS framework, we pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives relating to idea generation, product development and commercialization, global sourcing of materials and services, manufacturing improvement and sales and marketing.  

To further these objectives we also acquire businesses that either strategically fit within our existing business portfolio or expand our portfolio into a new and attractive business area. Given the rapid pace of technological

 development and the specialized expertise typical of our served markets, acquisitions also provide us important access to new technologies and domain expertise. We believe there are many acquisition opportunities available within our target markets. The extent to which we make and effectively integrate appropriate acquisitions will affect our overall growth and operating results. We also continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment.  

Danaher Corporation, originally DMG, Inc., was organized in 1969 as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust. In 1978 it was reorganized as a Florida corporation under the name Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc. (DMI) which in a second reorganization in 1980 became a subsidiary of a newly created holding company named DMG, Inc. We adopted the name Danaher in 1984 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation following the 1986 annual meeting of our shareholders.  

Sales in 2010 by geographic destination were: North America, 49% (including 45% in the U.S.); Europe, 28%; Asia/Australia, 17%; and other regions, 6%. For additional information regarding our segments and sales by geography, please refer to Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  

Operating Segments  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company changed the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in its internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Companys businesses and the contribution of certain of the Companys tool manufacturing and distribution businesses to the Apex joint venture. The Company now reports results in five separate business segments consisting of the Test & Measurement; Environmental; Life Sciences & Diagnostics; Dental; and Industrial Technologies segments. The Company previously reported its operations under four segments: Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies; Industrial Technologies; and Tools & Components. All information set forth in this report has been recast to reflect the new segmentation.

************************************  

The following discussions of Materials, Intellectual Property, Competition, Seasonal Nature of Business, Working Capital, Backlog, Employee Relations, Research and Development, Government Contracts, Regulatory Matters, International Operations and Major Customers include information common to all of our segments.  

Materials  

Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in our supply chain, including the use of alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources. During 2010 we had no raw material shortages that had a material adverse effect on our business. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Intellectual Property  

We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher or its subsidiaries.  

Competition  

Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors, competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research, and financial capabilities. We are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new, large companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. Key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Seasonal Nature of Business  

General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end-markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products, and sales to the United States government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.  

Working Capital  

We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items. In addition, our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.  

Backlog  

The table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our five segments at the end of 2010 and 2009 ($ in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We expect that a large majority of these unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months. Given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles, we believe that backlog is indicative of short-term revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term performance.  

Employee Relations  

At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 48,200 persons, of whom approximately 21,400 were employed in the United States and approximately 26,800 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 1,560 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where many of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Research and Development  

The table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate ($ in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Government Contracts  

Although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2010 was from customers other than governmental entities, we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense, motion, test & measurement, life sciences & diagnostics, water quality, product identification, and sensors and controls businesses. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Regulatory Matters  

We face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to.  

Environmental Laws and Regulations  

Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

In addition to environmental compliance costs, we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at certain sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes and/or are or were property owners require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under U.S. federal and state environmental laws. We have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Remediation activities generally involve soil and/or groundwater contamination and may include pre-remedial activities such as fact-finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study, and/or design, as well as remediation actions such as contaminant removal, monitoring and/or installation, operation and maintenance of longer-term remediation systems. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.

We have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmental-related claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and third-party sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our environmental provisions. We generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies, as well as our prior experience with similar sites. If we determine that potential liability for a particular site or with respect to a personal injury claim is probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site or claim. While we actively pursue insurance recoveries, as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude.  

The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. All provisions have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries. For the reasons described above, we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change.  

In view of our financial position and provisions for environmental remediation matters and other environmental-related claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. For a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Medical Devices  

Certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and by the comparable agencies of the non-U.S. countries where our products are sold. Some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the United States.  

Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the FDA regulates virtually all phases of the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of medical devices, including their introduction into interstate commerce, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution and record keeping. Pursuant to the FDCA and FDA regulations, certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the FDA as medical device manufacturing establishments. The FDA, as well as industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization (ISO), regularly inspect our registered and/or certified facilities.  

We sell both Class I and Class II medical devices. A medical device, whether exempt from, or cleared pursuant to, the premarket notification requirements of the FDCA, or approved pursuant to a premarket approval application, is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, product labeling requirements and limitations, including those related to promotion and marketing efforts, quality system requirements and medical device (adverse event) reporting. Certain of our products utilize radioactive material, and we are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. For a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Export/Import Compliance  

We are required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, including:  

       the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (which are items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List);

Table of Contents 

       the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export or re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications);  

       the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and  

       the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  

Other nations governments have implemented similar export and import control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

International Operations  

Our products and services are available worldwide, and our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia. We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that successfully target developing countries. The table below describes annual revenue derived from customers outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate:

For additional information related to revenues and long-lived assets by country, please refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for information regarding deferred taxes by geography, please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The manner in which our products and services are sold outside the United States differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the United States, though we also sell directly from the U.S. into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors.  

Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For a discussion of risks related to our non-US operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
