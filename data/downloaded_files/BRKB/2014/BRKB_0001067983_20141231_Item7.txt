Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Results of Operations  

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshires corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate tone at the top messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  

Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting in each of the last three years, including $1.7 billion in 2014. Periodic earnings from insurance underwriting are significantly impacted by the magnitude of catastrophe loss events occurring during the period. In 2014, we did not incur any losses from significant catastrophe events, compared to after-tax losses of approximately $285 million in 2013 and $725 million in 2012.  

Our railroad business earnings increased 2.0% in 2014, although earnings were negatively impacted by various service-related challenges during the year. Earnings from our railroad business in 2013 exceeded 2012 by 12.5% driven by increased volume over the network. Earnings of our utilities and energy businesses in 2014 exceeded 2013 by 28.0%, due to the acquisition of NV Energy in December 2013 and higher earnings from several of our other energy businesses. Earnings from utility and energy businesses in 2013 exceeded 2012 by 11.1%. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2014 increased 15.2% over 2013, which increased 15.5% over 2012. These increases reflected the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions, earnings growth in certain operations and reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Other in the preceding table includes after-tax earnings from our investments in Heinz Holdings of $652 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013.  

After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $3.3 billion in 2014, $4.3 billion in 2013 and $2.2 billion in 2012. In each year, after-tax gains included gains from the reductions in estimated liabilities under equity index put option contracts and dispositions of investments, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment charges. In 2014, after-tax gains included approximately $2.0 billion related to the exchanges of Phillips 66 (in the first quarter) and Graham Holdings Company (in the second quarter) common stocks for a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. After-tax investment gains in 2013 included gains associated with the fair value increases of certain investment securities where unrealized gains or losses were reflected in periodic earnings. In 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains also included gains from settlements and expirations of credit default contracts. We believe that investment and derivatives gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

InsuranceUnderwriting  

We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.  

Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains.  

The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. For the purpose of this discussion, we consider catastrophe losses significant if the pre-tax losses incurred from a single event (or series of related events such as tornadoes) exceed $100 million on a consolidated basis. In 2014, we did not incur any significant catastrophe losses. In 2013, we incurred pre-tax losses of $436 million related to two catastrophe events in Europe. In 2012, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 billion attributable to Hurricane Sandy. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $71.5 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2014 may develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings.  

Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate changes produced pre-tax gains in 2014 and losses in 2013 and 2012. Historically, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been relatively significant. These gains and losses are included in underwriting expenses.  

A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. A measure of capital strength is combined shareholders equity determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Statutory Surplus). Statutory Surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2014. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

GEICO  

Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICOs policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICOs underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Premiums written and earned in 2014 were approximately $21.0 billion and $20.5 billion, respectively, which represented increases of 9.8% and 10.4%, respectively compared to premiums written and earned in 2013. These increases were attributable to an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 6.6% during the past twelve months and increased average premium per policy. Voluntary auto new business sales increased about 1.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2014 were approximately 821,000 higher than at December 31, 2013.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2014 increased $1.7 billion (11.7%) to $15.9 billion. The ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned (the loss ratio) was 77.7% in 2014 compared to 76.7% in 2013. In 2014, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages increased in the three to four percent range over 2013, partially due to more severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2014. Claims frequencies for bodily injury coverage increased about one percent, while frequencies for personal injury protection decreased three to four percent. Physical damage severities increased one to two percent in 2014 and bodily injury severities decreased in the one to two percent range from severities in 2013. Overall, personal injury protection severities were relatively flat although we experienced relatively large, but offsetting, changes by jurisdiction. In both 2014 and 2013, losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were favorably impacted by reductions of estimates for prior years losses.  

Underwriting expenses in 2014 increased $223 million (7.0%) to $3.4 billion. The increase reflected the increased policy acquisition costs to generate the growth in policies-in-force and increased other operating expenses. The ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned (the expense ratio) was 16.6% in 2014 and 17.2% in 2013.  

Premiums written in 2013 were $19.1 billion, an increase of 11.4% over premiums written in 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 increased approximately $1.8 billion (10.9%) to approximately $18.6 billion. The growth in premiums reflected an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 7.8% and to a lesser degree, higher average premiums per policy. The increase in policies-in-force reflected a 12.1% increase in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2013 were approximately 898,000 greater than at December 31, 2012.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2013 increased $1.6 billion (12.2%) to $14.3 billion. The loss ratio was 76.7% in 2013 compared to 75.9% in 2012. In 2013, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages generally increased in the two to four percent range and physical damage claims severities increased in the three to four percent range as compared to 2012. In addition, average bodily injury claims frequencies increased in the one to two percent range. Bodily injury claims severities increased in the one to three percent range, although severities for personal injury protection coverage declined, primarily in Florida. In 2012, we incurred losses of approximately $490 million related to Hurricane Sandy. In both 2013 and 2012, losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were favorably impacted by reductions of estimates for prior years losses.  

Underwriting expenses incurred in 2013 declined $170 million (5.1%) to $3.2 billion. Underwriting expenses in 2012 were impacted by a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs. Excluding the effects of the accounting change, the expense ratio in 2013 declined by approximately 0.4 percentage points from 2012.

General Re  

Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Res underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

Property/casualty premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $285 million (9.6%) and $96 million (3.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the increases in premiums written and earned in 2014 were $246 million (8.3%) and $100 million (3.3%), respectively. The increases were primarily due to treaty participations as well as growth in our facultative and primary casualty businesses. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by declining business where prices are deemed inadequate and remain prepared to increase premium volume when appropriate prices are attained relative to the risks assumed.  

Our combined property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains in 2014 of $170 million compared to $148 million in 2013. In 2014 and 2013, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $466 million and $153 million, respectively. Underwriting results in 2014 reflected no significant catastrophe events as compared to 2013 which included $400 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to a hailstorm ($280 million) and floods ($120 million) in Europe. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. In both periods, property results also benefitted from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years exposures. The favorable development in each period was primarily attributable to lower than expected losses reported from ceding companies.  

Our casualty/workers compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $296 million in 2014 as compared to $5 million in 2013. Casualty/workers compensation underwriting results included gains from reductions of estimated ultimate losses on prior years business of $123 million in 2014 and $354 million in 2013. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period means that the ultimate liability estimates currently established will continue to develop favorably. The pre-tax underwriting losses in each year also reflected recurring charges related to discount accretion on workers compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges pertaining to retroactive reinsurance contracts. These charges aggregated $138 million in 2014 and $141 million in 2013.  

Property/casualty premiums written in 2013 were relatively unchanged while premiums earned increased $103 million (3.5%) when compared to 2012. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2013 increased $8 million (0.3%) and $83 million (2.9%), respectively, versus 2012. This was primarily due to increases in European treaty business.  

Our combined property/casualty operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $148 million in 2013 and $399 million in 2012. Property underwriting gains in 2013 were $153 million, a decline of $199 million from 2012. Property results in 2013 included $400 million of catastrophe losses primarily from a storm and floods in Europe while results in 2012 included $266 million of catastrophe losses, which were primarily attributable to Hurricane Sandy ($226 million). In each year, property results also benefitted from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years business.  

In 2013, casualty/workers compensation business generated an underwriting loss of $5 million compared to an underwriting gain of $47 million in 2012. In each year, results benefitted from lower than expected losses from prior years casualty business. Underwriting results also included charges for discount accretion on workers compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization of $141 million in 2013 and $158 million in 2012.

Life/health  

Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $170 million (5.7%) and $184 million (6.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written in 2014 increased $217 million (7.3%) over 2013 and premiums earned were $234 million (7.9%) higher than 2013. These increases primarily derived from life business across a number of non-U.S. markets. Premiums written in 2013 decreased $11 million (0.4%), while premiums earned increased $11 million (0.4%) compared with 2012. Adjusting for the effects of currency exchange rate changes, premiums written in 2013 increased $9 million (0.3%) over 2012 and premiums earned in 2013 were $32 million (1.1%) greater than 2012. The increases were primarily attributable to increased non-U.S. life business.  

Our life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $107 million in 2014 compared to $135 million in 2013. In 2014, we increased reserves by approximately $50 million as a result of reducing discount rates for certain European long-term care and disability business. In 2014, we also experienced increased frequency and severity of claims in Australian disability business.  

Life/health pre-tax underwriting gains in 2013 were driven by lower than expected mortality. Underwriting results for 2012 were negatively impacted by a premium deficiency reserve that was established on the run-off of the U.S. long-term care business as well as greater than expected claims on Australian disability business. Underwriting results in all three years also reflected charges attributable to the periodic discount accretion on U.S. long-term care liabilities.  

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  

Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in the periodic underwriting results. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events arising under property/casualty coverages. BHRGs underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and annuity businesses. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

Premiums earned in 2014 were $4,064 million, a decline of $1,085 million (21%) compared to 2013. Premiums earned in 2014 with respect to a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (Swiss Re) declined $1.3 billion from premiums earned in 2013. This contract expired at the end of 2012 and is in run-off. Property catastrophe premiums earned in 2014 were $688 million, a decline of $113 million (14%) as compared to 2013. Our volume with respect to these coverages continues to be constrained, as rates, in our view, are inadequate. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. These declines were partially offset by increased premiums earned from property quota-share contracts.  

The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events during 2014. Our property business, including property catastrophe business, generated pre-tax underwriting gains of approximately $700 million in 2014 compared to underwriting gains of about $800 million in 2013. The Swiss Re quota-share contract produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $283 million in 2014 and $351 million in 2013, primarily attributable to reductions in estimates of ultimate liabilities for prior years losses. BHRGs underwriting results can be significantly impacted by foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries (primarily arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts), which are denominated in foreign currencies. Underwriting results included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $315 million in 2014 compared to losses of $28 million in 2013.

Property/casualty (Continued)  

Premiums earned from property/casualty business in 2013 declined $973 million (16%) compared to 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 from the Swiss Re quota-share contract were approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 compared to $3.4 billion in 2012. Property catastrophe premiums earned in 2013 aggregated $801 million, a decline of 2% versus 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 from other property/casualty business, increased $981 million (52%) over 2012, which was primarily attributable to increased property quota-share business.  

BHRGs property/casualty business generated a pre-tax underwriting gain of $695 million in 2012. Underwriting results in 2012 included losses incurred of $364 million attributable to Hurricane Sandy. Underwriting results in 2012 also included foreign currency transaction losses of $123 million.  

Retroactive reinsurance  

Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded for the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in periodic earnings.  

On July 17, 2014, National Indemnity Company (NICO), the lead insurance entity of BHRG, entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (LMIC). The agreement provides that NICO reinsure substantially all of LMICs unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expense liabilities related to (a) asbestos and environmental claims from policies incepting prior to 2005 and (b) workers compensation claims occurrences arising prior to January 1, 2014, in excess of an aggregate retention of approximately $12.5 billion and subject to an aggregate limit of $6.5 billion. The premiums earned in 2014 and the consideration paid to NICO with respect to this contract was approximately $3.0 billion.  

Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance policies were $905 million in 2014, $321 million in 2013 and $201 million in 2012. In each year, underwriting losses included deferred charge amortization. In addition, underwriting results were impacted in 2014 and 2013 by increases in the estimated ultimate liabilities related to these policies, partially offset by increases in related deferred charge balances. In 2014, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for contracts written in prior years by approximately $825 million, substantially all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased ultimate liability estimates on remaining asbestos claims and re-estimated the timing of future payments of such liabilities as a result of actuarial analysis. The increase in ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses in the fourth quarter of approximately $500 million.  

Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $24.3 billion at December 31, 2014, $17.7 billion at December 31, 2013 and $18.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Unamortized deferred charges related to BHRGs retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $7.7 billion at December 31, 2014, $4.25 billion at December 31, 2013 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2012. The increases in unpaid losses and unamortized deferred charges during 2014 were primarily related to the LMIC contract. As previously indicated, deferred charge balances will be charged to pre-tax earnings in the future.  

Life and annuity  

Life and annuity premiums earned in 2014 declined $628 million (19%) compared to premiums earned in 2013. The decline was primarily attributable to a 22% decline in premiums earned from annuity contracts and also from two unusually large transactions in 2013 which produced net premiums of approximately $400 million. The two transactions were as follows: (1) a new variable annuity guarantee contract, which produced premiums earned of $1.7 billion, and (2) an amendment of an existing yearly renewable term life reinsurance contract with Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (SRLHA), which resulted in return premiums of about $1.3 billion. The SRLHA contract amendment essentially commuted coverage with respect to a number of the underlying contracts in exchange for payments to SRLHA of approximately $675 million.

Life and annuity (Continued)  

Life and annuity premiums earned in 2013 increased $476 million (17%) over premiums earned in 2012. The increase in 2013 was primarily attributable to the aforementioned new variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contract and the reversal of premiums under the SRLHA contract as a result of the contract amendment. Premiums earned in 2013 and 2012 also included $1.4 billion and $794 million, respectively, from traditional annuity insurance and reinsurance contracts.  

The life and annuity business produced a pre-tax loss of $173 million in 2014, a pre-tax gain of $379 million in 2013 and a pre-tax loss in 2012 of $190 million. Before foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, this business generated a pre-tax loss of $275 million in 2014, a pre-tax gain of $442 million in 2013 and a pre-tax loss of $174 million in 2012.  

Structured settlement and traditional annuity contracts generated underwriting losses of $299 million in 2014, $151 million in 2013, and $143 million in 2012 before foreign currency effects. Generally, all of the premiums under these contracts are received at inception and payments are made over time, often extending for decades. These underwriting losses were primarily attributable to the recurring impact of the accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Aggregate annuity liabilities were approximately $7.1 billion at December 31, 2014, $5.7 billion at December 31, 2013 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2012.  

The life and annuity business also included pre-tax gains of $47 million in 2014 and $256 million in 2013 from variable annuity guarantee contracts. The gains were primarily attributable to the impact of rising equity markets which lowered estimates of liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. Periodic results from these contracts can be volatile reflecting changes in returns in investment markets, which impact the underlying insured exposures. In 2013, life and annuity underwriting results included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million related to the aforementioned amendment to the SRLHA reinsurance contract. This one-time gain occurred as the reversal of premiums earned was more than offset by the reversal of life benefits incurred.  

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  

The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company and Princeton Insurance Company, providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Companys primary group (NICO Primary), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC), providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and Medicare Supplement insurance; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft; and Berkshire Hathaway Guard Insurance Companies (Guard), providers of workers compensation and commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses. In the second quarter of 2013, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BH Specialty), which concentrates on providing large scale insurance solutions for commercial property and casualty risks.  

Premiums earned in 2014 and 2013 aggregated $4.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The increase in premiums was primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and Guard. Premiums earned in 2013 by BH Primary increased $1,079 million (48%) over 2012. The comparative increase in 2013 reflected the impact of the Guard acquisition in 2012. In addition, BHHCs premiums earned increased $301 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, due primarily to significantly higher workers compensation insurance volume. The BH Primary insurers produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting gains of $626 million in 2014, $385 million in 2013 and $286 million in 2012. Combined loss ratios were 60% in 2014 and in 2013 and 58% in 2012. Overall, the claim environment over the past three years has been favorable. However, these primary insurers write sizable amounts of liability and workers compensation business, which can have extended claim tails. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience or underwriting results will continue into the future.

InsuranceInvestment Income (Continued)  

Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on investments held by our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2014 was $4,357 million, representing a decline of $356 million (8%) versus 2013. The decline was attributable to lower interest income from fixed maturity securities, partially offset by increased dividend income from equity securities. The reduction in interest income reflected the maturities and dispositions during the last two years of several fixed maturity securities with higher interest rates, including $4.4 billion par amount of Wrigley 11.45% subordinated notes as a result of the repurchase of those notes by the issuer in 2013. Our insurance businesses continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances (approximately $42.8 billion as of December 31, 2014) earning very low yields. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents. The increase in dividends earned reflected higher dividend rates for certain of our equity holdings. Beginning in 2015, investment income will include dividends from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. Preferred Stock ($3 billion stated value).  

Pre-tax investment income in 2013 increased $259 million (5.8%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to increased dividend income on equity investments, which reflected increased dividend rates for certain of our larger equity holdings as well as increased overall investments in equity securities.  

Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $84 billion at December 31, 2014, $77 billion at December 31, 2013, and $73 billion at December 31, 2012. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year.  

A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 follows. Other investments include investments in The Dow Chemical Company, Bank of America Corporation and Restaurant Brands International, Inc. See Note 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts are in millions.

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe)  

Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNSF) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSFs major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated revenues in 2014 were approximately $23.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.2 billion (5.6%) over 2013. The overall year-to-date increase in revenues reflected a 1.8% increase in cars/units handled and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit. In 2014, our combined volume was approximately 10.3 million cars/units.  

Our rail operations were negatively affected by severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, particularly in the Northern U.S. service territory as well as from various other service issues throughout 2014. These issues resulted in slower average speeds on our system and negatively impacted volumes and revenues of each of our business groups. We experienced improvement in operating performance and freight volumes over the fourth quarter of 2014. Nevertheless, our service levels at the end of 2014 were well below our internal standards, as well as those expected by our customers. We continue to work diligently to address service issues without compromising safety. We added capacity in 2014 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects, additional equipment and new employee hires. We plan to continue these initiatives in 2015 in order to meet customer demand and improve and maintain service levels.  

Revenues from consumer products in 2014 were $7.0 billion, and were relatively unchanged from 2013. In 2014, unit volume and average revenues per car were relatively flat versus 2013. In 2014, our international intermodal business volume was negatively affected by congestion at U.S. West Coast ports. Should these conditions persist, our volumes in 2015 may suffer. In 2014, revenues from industrial products increased $508 million (9%) to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases in overall unit volume, and to a lesser extent, changes in rates and product mix. Revenues from agricultural products in 2014 increased $584 million (16%) to approximately $4.2 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to increased volume, rates and product mix changes. Also, agricultural products volume in 2013 was negatively affected by the drought conditions in 2012. In 2014, coal revenues of $5.0 billion were essentially unchanged from 2013, as a 2% increase in year-to-date unit volume was offset by a 2% decline in average rates.  

Operating expenses in 2014 were $16.2 billion, representing an increase of $880 million (6%) over 2013. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $372 million (8%) in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased employment levels, and to a lesser extent, wage inflation and higher overtime. Fuel expenses were relatively unchanged compared to 2013. The favorable impact from lower average fuel prices was largely offset by higher volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $150 million (8%) as a result of additional assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $209 million (12%) compared to 2013 as a result of higher crew transportation and other travel costs, and increased costs of utilities.  

Consolidated revenues in 2013 were approximately $22.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion (5.7%) over 2012. The overall increase in revenues reflected a 4.5% increase in cars/units handled and a slight increase in average revenue per car/unit, attributable to rates. In 2013, BNSF generated higher revenues from industrial products, consumer products and coal, partially offset by lower revenues from agricultural products.

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) (Continued)  

In 2013, industrial products revenues of $5.7 billion increased 14% versus 2012, driven by an 11% increase in volume, reflecting significantly higher petroleum products volumes. Consumer products revenues were $7.0 billion, an increase of 6% over 2012 that was primarily attributable to volume increases from domestic intermodal business and higher export demand. Coal revenues were $5.0 billion, an increase of 2.6% over 2012, which was attributable to increased volume. The volume increase reflected increased coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices and reduced utility stockpiles, partially offset by severe weather issues impacting service levels. Agricultural products revenues of $3.6 billion declined 4% versus 2012 due to volume declines, which were mainly attributable to lower grain exports as a result of the drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012 and strong global competition.  

Operating expenses in 2013 were approximately $15.4 billion, an increase of $522 million (3.5%) compared to 2012. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $146 million (3.2%) as compared to 2012, reflecting volume-related cost increases and wage inflation. Fuel expenses increased $44 million (1%) versus 2012, as the impact of higher volume was partially offset by lower average fuel prices. Purchased services expenses increased 2% versus 2012, due primarily to volume-related costs, including purchased transportation for BNSF Logistics LLC, a wholly-owned, third-party logistics business. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $204 million (13%) over 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes, crew travel costs, derailment-related costs and locomotive material expenses.  

Interest expense in 2014 was $833 million, an increase of $104 million (14%) compared to 2013. Interest expense in 2013 increased $106 million (17%) versus 2012. BNSF funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. In each period, the increased interest expense resulted from higher average outstanding debt.  

Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company)  

We hold an 89.9% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE), which operates an international energy business. BHEs domestic regulated utility interests are currently comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC), and NV Energy, which was acquired in December 2013. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. BHE acquired AltaLink, L.P. (AltaLink) on December 1, 2014. AltaLink operates a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada. AltaLinks revenues and earnings for the month of December 2014 are included in other energy businesses. In addition, BHE also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and franchise network in the United States.  

The rates that our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued)  

PacifiCorp  

PacifiCorp operates a regulated utility business in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Revenues in 2014 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $100 million (2%) compared to revenues in 2013. In 2014, revenues increased primarily due to higher rates, partially offset by lower retail customer load. PacifiCorps EBIT were $1.0 billion, an increase of $28 million (3%) over 2013. The increase in EBIT reflected the impact of the increase in operating revenues and the recognition of estimated insurance recoveries from a fire loss as compared to a reduction in 2013 EBIT from charges related to the fire, partially offset by increased energy costs and higher depreciation expense. The increase in depreciation expense reflected the impact of changes in depreciation rates and higher plant in service, including a new generation facility.  

Revenues in 2013 were $5.2 billion, an increase of $265 million (5%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $337 million, partially offset by lower renewable energy credits of $74 million. The increase in retail revenues reflected higher prices approved by regulators and higher retail customer loads. EBIT in 2013 were $982 million, an increase of $245 million (33%) compared to 2012. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to charges of $165 million in 2012 related to litigation, fire and other damage claims, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenues. Before the impact of the aforementioned claims, EBIT in 2013 as a percentage of revenues were relatively unchanged from 2012.  

MEC  

MEC operates a regulated utility business primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues in 2014 increased $365 million (11%) to $3.8 billion. In 2014, revenues from regulated natural gas increased $172 million compared to 2013. The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was driven by higher per-unit natural gas costs, which are recovered from customers via adjustment clauses, and higher volumes attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of 2014. Regulated electric revenues increased $55 million compared to 2013 and was primarily due to increased retail rates. Nonregulated revenues increased $122 million compared to 2013 due to higher natural gas and electricity prices and higher electricity volumes, partly offset by lower natural gas volumes. EBIT were $298 million in 2014, an increase of $68 million (30%) compared to 2013. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to increased earnings from the regulated electric business, reflecting the impact of higher revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense due to the impact of depreciation rate changes, partially offset by increased energy and operating costs.  

Revenues in 2013 increased $178 million (5%) over 2012. The increase in revenues reflected higher regulated electric and natural gas revenues and lower nonregulated and other revenues. Regulated retail electric revenues increased $82 million, while regulated natural gas revenues increased $165 million compared to 2012. The increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to higher regulatory rates in Iowa and Illinois and increases in retail customer load. The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was primarily due to higher retail volumes and increases in recoveries through adjustment clauses as a result of a higher average per-unit cost of gas sold. Nonregulated and other operating revenues declined $67 million compared to 2012 primarily due to lower electricity volumes and prices. EBIT declined $6 million in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting lower regulated and nonregulated electric operating earnings, partially offset by higher natural gas earnings.  

NV Energy  

BHE acquired NV Energy on December 19, 2013, and its results are included in our consolidated results beginning as of that date. In 2014, revenues and EBIT were $3.3 billion and $549 million, respectively. In 2013, NV Energys results for the December 19 through 31, 2013 period were included in other energy businesses and reflected one-time customer refunds, acquisition costs and other charges arising from the acquisition. NV Energys revenues and EBIT are normally higher in the second and third quarters due to higher electricity consumption in its service territories.  

Northern Powergrid  

Northern Powergrids revenues of $1.3 billion in 2014 increased $258 million (25%) as compared to 2013. EBIT were $527 million in 2014, an increase of $165 million (46%) compared to 2013. The increases in revenues and EBIT were due mainly to increased distribution revenues from increased rates and favorable regulatory provisions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.  

In 2013, revenues declined $10 million (1%) compared to 2012. EBIT in 2013 was $362 million, a decline of $67 million versus 2012. EBIT were negatively impacted by fourth quarter rebates to customers and higher regulatory rate provisions, which reduced revenues, and from higher distribution operating expenses and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation in 2013. Operating expenses in 2013 included comparatively higher pension costs and higher depreciation expenses. EBIT in 2013 also included a $9 million loss from the write-off of hydrocarbon well exploration costs.

Natural Gas Pipelines  

Natural gas pipeline revenues increased $122 million (13%) in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase reflected comparatively higher revenues from increased natural gas rates and volumes as a result of significantly colder weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014 in Northern Natural Gas Companys service territory and system rebalancing activities over the first half of 2014. EBIT in 2014 of $379 million were relatively unchanged from 2013. Revenues and EBIT in 2013 were $971 million and $385 million, respectively, and were relatively unchanged from 2012.  

Other energy businesses  

Revenues and EBIT in 2014 from other energy businesses increased $408 million and $232 million, respectively, over revenues and EBIT in 2013. The increases were primarily attributable to increased revenues from new solar facilities as additional assets were placed in service and from the inclusion of revenues and EBIT of AltaLink for the month of December. The increase in revenues from other activities in 2013 was $81 million, which was primarily attributable to revenues from the new solar and wind-powered facilities, partially offset by the impact of one-time customer refunds issued by NV Energy and impairment losses associated with BHEs interests in certain geothermal electricity generation projects. EBIT from other activities declined $87 million in 2013 compared to 2012, as the impacts of the aforementioned losses associated with geothermal projects and NV Energy acquisition costs and customer refunds, more than offset the increase in earnings from the new solar and wind-powered electricity generation projects.  

Real estate brokerage  

Revenues of the real estate brokerage businesses increased $339 million (19%) in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase reflected the impact of revenues from acquired businesses, partially offset by lower revenues from existing operations, due to a 6% decline in closed units and lower franchise revenues. EBIT of $139 million in 2014 were unchanged from 2013 as the increases in EBIT from acquired businesses were offset by lower EBIT from existing businesses and higher operating expenses related to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices rebranding activities.  

Real estate brokerage revenues in 2013 increased $489 million (37%) over 2012, while EBIT increased $57 million (70%) versus 2012. The increases in revenues and EBIT were attributable to increases in closed brokerage transactions and higher average home sales prices from existing business and the impact of businesses acquired during the previous two years.  

Corporate interest and income taxes  

Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. In 2014, corporate interest expense increased due to new borrowings in connection with the NV Energy and AltaLink acquisitions. BHEs consolidated effective income tax rates were 23% in 2014, 7% in 2013 and 9% in 2012. In each year, BHEs income tax rates reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation in the United States. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid are taxed at a lower statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom compared to the statutory tax rate in the United States. BHEs effective rate was reduced in 2013 due to a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of enacted statutory income tax rate decreases in the United Kingdom.

McLane Company  

McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. In 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (MBM), a large foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains. Through its subsidiaries, McLane also operates as a wholesale distributor of distilled spirits, wine and beer. McLanes grocery and foodservice businesses are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have a significant adverse impact on McLanes periodic revenues and earnings.  

Revenues in 2014 of $46.6 billion increased $710 million (1.5%) compared to 2013. The overall revenue increase reflected increased foodservice and beverage revenues, while grocery revenues were relatively flat. Pre-tax earnings in 2014 declined $51 million (10.5%) from 2013. Earnings in 2013 included a pre-tax gain of $24 million from the sale of a logistics business. Before the impact of this gain, McLanes earnings in 2014 decreased 6% compared to 2013. The decline reflected higher earnings from the grocery and beverage businesses which was more than offset by lower earnings from the foodservice business. In 2014, our foodservice operations experienced higher per unit processing costs and higher other operating costs which more than offset the increase in revenues.  

McLanes revenues in 2013 were approximately $45.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $8.5 billion (23%) over revenues in 2012. The increase in revenues reflected the impact of the MBM acquisition, as well as year-to-date revenue increases ranging from 10% to 15% in the grocery, other foodservice and beverage businesses. Revenues of each of these businesses in 2013 included the impact of new customers added in 2012 and 2013. McLanes pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $83 million (21%) over earnings in 2012. The increase in 2013 pre-tax earnings reflected the increases in revenues, including the impact of the MBM acquisition, and a gain from the sale of a logistics business, partially offset by slightly lower operating margins.  

Manufacturing  

This group includes a variety of businesses that manufacture industrial and end-user products and include: The Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol), a specialty chemical manufacturer; IMC International Metalworking Companies (IMC), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide; Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles; and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Also included are the diversified manufacturing operations of Marmon, which in prior years were presented separately with its transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing operations. In this report, Marmons transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses are included in our finance and financial products group. Our manufacturing businesses also include several building products businesses (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and six apparel businesses (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Aggregate revenues of our manufacturers in 2014 increased $2.5 billion (7%) to $36.8 billion. Pre-tax earnings of this group of businesses were $4.8 billion in 2014, an increase of $606 million (14%) versus 2013.  

Revenues in 2014 from our industrial and end-user products manufacturers increased $2.0 billion (10%) to $22.3 billion. Pre-tax earnings from these businesses in 2014 increased $416 million (14%) to $3.5 billion. Lubrizols revenues in 2014 increased $546 million (9%) to $6.9 billion, while pre-tax earnings increased 10% compared to 2013. The increases were primarily due to the impact of bolt-on acquisitions. Forest Rivers revenues in 2014 increased 14% to $3.8 billion due to increased unit sales. Forest Rivers pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased 21% over 2013 due primarily to the aforementioned increase in unit sales and relatively lower manufacturing costs. In 2014, IMCs pre-tax earnings increased 18% over 2013 which reflected the impact of a 6% year-to-date increase in sales, as well as increased gross margin rates and lower operating expense rates.

Manufacturing (Continued)  

Marmons manufacturing revenues were $5.95 billion in 2014, an increase of $791 million (15%) compared to 2013. The revenue increase in 2014 was primarily attributable to the beverage dispensing and merchandising businesses acquired at the beginning of 2014. Excluding this acquisitions impact, revenues were relatively unchanged from 2013. In 2014, Marmon experienced volume-driven revenue growth in several business markets, including: commercial trailer and aftermarket brake drums; residential water treatment systems in China and the United States; specialty metal pipe, tubing and steel beam; specialty and utility cable products; and automotive, safety and construction fastener markets. These increases were substantially offset by revenue declines from lower copper prices and lower volumes in the electrical and plumbing products businesses and the strategic decision to exit the low margin building wire and copper tubing businesses. Marmons manufacturing pre-tax earnings were $708 million in 2014, an increase of $111 million (19%) over earnings in 2013. The earnings increase primarily reflected the favorable impact of the acquisition of IMI plc beverage dispensing and merchandising businesses, the impact of the revenue growth discussed previously and cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in the retail store equipment and electrical and plumbing products businesses.  

Revenues in 2014 from our building products businesses were approximately $10.1 billion, an increase of 5% over 2013. In 2014, Johns Manville, Acme and MiTek produced revenue increases, which were primarily due to higher sales volume, as well as from the impact of recent MiTek bolt-on acquisitions. Revenues in 2014 from Shaw were relatively unchanged from 2013, reflecting the impact of the closure of its rugs division in early 2014 and lower carpet sales, offset by higher sales of hard flooring products. Pre-tax earnings in 2014 of the building products businesses increased 6% compared to 2013. Each of our building products businesses generated increased earnings in 2014 over 2013, with the exception of Shaw, whose earnings declined due to comparatively higher raw material costs.  

Apparel revenues in 2014 were $4.3 billion, a slight increase (1%) compared to 2013. Pre-tax earnings increased $140 million (44%) over 2013. In 2014, our apparel businesses benefitted from restructuring initiatives undertaken in 2013 and 2014, which included discontinuing unprofitable business, as well as from comparatively lower manufacturing and pension costs.  

Aggregate revenues of our manufacturers in 2013 were $34.3 billion, an increase of $2.15 billion (7%) versus 2012. Pre-tax earnings of this group of businesses were $4.2 billion in 2013, an increase of $294 million (8%) versus 2012. Revenues in 2013 from our industrial and end-user products manufacturers increased $1.3 billion (7%) to $20.3 billion, while pre-tax earnings increased $132 million (5%) to $3.0 billion. The increases in revenues and pre-tax earnings were primarily attributable to bolt-on acquisitions and increased revenues and earnings of Forest River.  

Lubrizols revenues in 2013 increased $267 million over 2012 to $6.4 billion, while revenues of IMC increased 10%. However, Lubrizols and IMCs pre-tax earnings in 2013 were relatively unchanged from 2012. Forest River revenues in 2013 were $3.3 billion, an increase of 24% over 2012, which was due to a 17% increase in volume and higher average sales prices, attributable to price and product mix changes. The increase in revenues drove Forest Rivers 32% increase in pre-tax earnings in 2013.  

Marmons manufacturing revenues in 2013 were $5.2 billion, a decrease of 3.5% compared to 2012. The revenue decline in 2013 was primarily due to the impact of lower steel and copper costs in the electrical and plumbing products businesses, volume reductions in the specialty metal pipe, tubing and steel beam businesses, several non-recurring large prior year projects in the specialty wire and cable business, and revenue reductions from exiting low margin building wire and copper tubing businesses. These reductions more than offset the revenue gains contributed by the automotive clutch and heavy duty truck axle, store fixture display products and the residential water treatment businesses. Marmons manufacturing pre-tax earnings in 2013 were $597 million, and were relatively unchanged from 2012. Pre-tax earnings benefitted from cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in both the retail store equipment and electrical and plumbing products businesses.  

Revenues in 2013 from our building products businesses increased 8% to about $9.6 billion. Pre-tax earnings of these businesses were $846 million, an increase of $98 million (13%) over 2012. These businesses benefitted from the generally improved residential and commercial construction markets. Apparel revenues in 2013 increased 3.5% to about $4.3 billion and pre-tax earnings increased $64 million (25%) to $315 million. Each of our apparel operations contributed to the higher earnings in 2013.

Service  

Our service businesses include NetJets, the worlds leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,500 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News and the BH Media Group (BH Media), which includes the Omaha World-Herald, as well as 28 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; and WPLG (acquired June 30, 2014), which operates a television station in Miami, Florida.  

Revenues of our service businesses in 2014 were approximately $9.85 billion, representing an increase of $858 million (9.5%) over 2013. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to comparative increases generated by NetJets, TTI, and FlightSafety. The revenue increase at NetJets reflected increased flight services revenues, which was attributable to increased flight hours as well as increased fractional aircraft sales. TTIs revenue increase was driven by higher unit volume and, to a lesser extent, by bolt-on acquisitions. FlightSafetys revenue increase was primarily due to increased simulator training hours. Pre-tax earnings of our service businesses in 2014 aggregated $1.2 billion, an increase of $109 million (10%) versus 2013. The increase in year-to-date earnings was primarily attributable to NetJets and TTI and was primarily due to the aforementioned increases in revenues. In addition, NetJets earnings increase was also due to comparatively lower aircraft impairment and restructuring charges and financing expenses, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, maintenance costs and subcontracted flight expenses.  

Revenues of our service businesses in 2013 were $9.0 billion, an increase of $821 million (10%) over revenues in 2012. In 2013, revenues of NetJets increased $288 million (7.5%), driven by higher sales of fractional aircraft shares, while TTIs revenues increased $255 million (11%) over 2012. Revenues of BH Media increased $207 million (66%), attributable to the impact of business acquisitions. Pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion in 2013 increased $127 million (13%) compared to 2012. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to BH Media, FlightSafety, TTI and NetJets. The earnings increase of BH Media was due to bolt-on acquisitions. TTIs earnings increased 10% due to higher sales and changes in product mix. FlightSafetys earnings increased 11%, reflecting increased training revenues and relatively unchanged operating expenses. NetJets earnings increased 7% as improved flight operations margins, fractional sales margins and reduced net financing costs more than offset an increase in aircraft impairment charges.  

Retailing  

Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), Sees Candies, Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools and Oriental Trading Company (OTC), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties.  

Revenues in 2014 increased $134 million (3%), while pre-tax earnings declined $32 million (8.5%) compared to 2013. The earnings declines in 2014 were primarily attributable to lower earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart and Pampered Chef. The earnings decline at Nebraska Furniture Mart was driven by costs incurred related to the build-out of a new store and warehouse facility (approximately 1.8 million square feet) in The Colony, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. The new store will open in 2015 and we anticipate it will generate meaningful revenues and earnings in the future. The decline in earnings of Pampered Chef resulted from lower sales.  

Revenues of our retailing businesses in 2013 were $4.3 billion, an increase of $573 million (15%) over 2012. Pre-tax earnings of these businesses increased $70 million (23%) as compared to earnings in 2012. The comparative increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to the inclusion of OTC for the full year in 2013. Otherwise, earnings of the home furnishings and jewelry retail groups increased while earnings of Pampered Chef and Sees Candies declined.

Finance and Financial Products  

Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, transportation equipment leasing), as well as other leasing and financing activities. UTLX manufactures, owns and leases railcars and intermodal tank cars, and also owns and leases cranes, while XTRA owns and leases over-the-road trailers. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Clayton Homes revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $111 million (3%) and $142 million (34%), respectively, compared to revenues and earnings in 2013. The increase in revenues was principally due to a 7% increase in homes sold, as interest and financial services revenues were relatively unchanged from 2013. Earnings continued to benefit from lower loan loss provisions on installment loan portfolios, lower interest expense on borrowings and improved manufacturing results. The declines in loan loss provisions reflected fewer delinquencies and foreclosures, while the declines in interest expense were primarily due to lower rates. Traditional single family housing markets receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Despite this competitive disadvantage, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions.  

Clayton Homes revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $185 million (6%) and $161 million (63%), respectively, compared to 2012. Pre-tax earnings benefitted from increased home sales, lower loan loss provisions and an increase in net interest income, as lower interest expense more than offset reductions in interest income on loan portfolios. Home unit sales increased 9%. Loan loss provisions declined, reflecting comparatively lower foreclosures volume and loss rates.  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 from our transportation equipment leasing businesses were $2.4 billion, and $827 million, respectively, which exceeded revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 by 11% and 17%, respectively. The earnings increase reflected a 9% increase in aggregate lease revenues, primarily due to increased units on lease and higher lease rates for railcars. A significant portion of the costs of these businesses, such as depreciation, will not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2013 from transportation equipment leasing increased $53 million (8%) to $704 million. The increase in earnings reflected increased lease revenues and earnings of both UTLX and XTRA, which benefitted from increases in working units and average rental rates and relatively stable operating expenses.  

Earnings from our other finance activities include CORTs furniture leasing business, interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments and our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own a 50% joint venture interest. In addition, other earnings include income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund installment loans of Clayton Homes and guarantee fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes and NetJets results. Interest spreads and guarantee fees charged to Clayton and NetJets were $70 million in 2014, $89 million in 2013 and $120 million in 2012.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses  

A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  

We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in earnings.  

Pre-tax investment gains in 2014 were $4.3 billion, which included gains of approximately $2.1 billion realized in connection with the exchanges of common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company for 100% of the common stock of a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Each exchange transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the businesses received over the tax-basis cost of the common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company exchanged.  

Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2013 were $4.3 billion and included approximately $2.1 billion related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants and Wrigley subordinated notes. Beginning in 2013, the unrealized gains or losses associated with the warrants were included in earnings. These warrants were exercised in October 2013 on a cashless basis in exchange for shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 billion. The Wrigley subordinated notes were repurchased for cash of $5.08 billion, resulting in a pre-tax investment gain of $680 million. Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 and were primarily attributable to sales of equity securities.  

Other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charges in 2014 were $697 million and predominantly related to our investments in equity securities of Tesco PLC. OTTI charges in 2013 and 2012 predominantly related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings bonds. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date OTTI charges are recorded in earnings, the increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI charges does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, consolidated gross unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were approximately $1.2 billion and $289 million, respectively. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2014, these unrealized losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets.  

In 2014, derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of $506 million. The change in the fair value of our credit default contract during 2014 produced a pre-tax gain of $397 million, and was attributable to lower credit spreads. There were no credit loss payments in 2014. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $108 million in 2014. Such gains reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and generally higher index values, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest rate assumptions. As of December 31, 2014, the intrinsic value of these contracts was approximately $1.4 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $4.6 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates.  

In 2013, derivative contracts generated a pre-tax gain of $2.6 billion, including $2.8 billion gain from equity index put option contracts and pre-tax losses of $213 million from credit default contracts. The gain from equity index put option contracts was due to changes in fair values of the contracts as a result of overall higher equity index values, favorable currency movements and modestly higher interest rate assumptions. The credit default contract loss was primarily attributable to an increase in estimated liabilities of our remaining municipality issuer contract, reflecting wider credit spreads. There were no credit loss payments in 2013.  

In 2012, our derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of approximately $2.0 billion, and included pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts of approximately $1.0 billion and gains from credit default contracts of approximately $900 million. The gains related to equity index put option contracts were due to increased index values, foreign currency exchange rate changes and valuation adjustments on a small number of contracts where contractual settlements will be determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. The gains on credit default contracts were attributable to narrower spreads and reduced time exposure, as well as from settlements related to the termination of certain contracts. In 2012, credit loss payments were $68 million.  

Other  

Corporate income and expenses not allocated to operating businesses produced after-tax losses of $145 million in 2014, $712 million in 2013 and $797 million in 2012. Our investments in Heinz generated after-tax earnings of $652 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013. Also included in other earnings are amortization of fair value adjustments made in connection with several prior business acquisitions (primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets) and corporate interest expense. These two charges (after-tax) aggregated $682 million in 2014, $514 million in 2013 and $630 million in 2012.  

Financial Condition  

Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2014 was $240.2 billion, an increase of $18.3 billion since December 31, 2013.  

As of December 31, 2014, cash and investments of our insurance and other businesses approximated $217.2 billion (excludes our investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation). In December 2014, an insurance subsidiary acquired common and preferred stock of Restaurant Brands International, Inc. for $3.0 billion in the aggregate. At December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents of insurance and other businesses were $58.0 billion, an increase of $15.5 billion since December 31, 2013.  

Berkshire Hathaway parent company borrowings include $8.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, of which $1.7 billion matured in February 2015. We currently expect to issue new senior notes in 2015 to replace some or all of this maturity. In 2014, Berkshire issued $750 million of parent company senior notes maturing in 2019 and repaid $750 million of notes in August. During the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire paid approximately $1.2 billion as final payment in connection with our acquisition of substantially all outstanding shares held by Marmon non-controlling shareholders at December 31, 2013.  

Berkshires Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at managements discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B common shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshires consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program during 2014.

Financial Condition (Continued)  

On December 1, 2014, BHE completed its acquisition of AltaLink, a regulated electric transmission-only company serving customers in Alberta, Canada. BHE purchased AltaLink for cash of approximately C$3.1 (approximately $2.7 billion). The acquisition was funded through loans from Berkshires insurance subsidiaries and the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2020, 2025 and 2045.  

Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2014, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were approximately $11.8 billion, including $6.6 billion by BHE and $5.2 billion by BNSF. BNSF and BHE forecast aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $12.3 billion in 2015. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances.  

In 2014, BNSF issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured debentures with maturities in 2024 and 2044. BNSFs outstanding debt was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $36.3 billion as of December 31, 2014, which excludes borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. BNSF and BHE have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2015 of about $3 billion. Berkshires commitment to provide additional capital to BHE to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries expired in 2014. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BHE or BNSF or any of their subsidiaries.  

Finance and financial products assets were approximately $33.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $33.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. Assets of these businesses consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents, a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments, as well as a sizable portfolio of various types of equipment and furniture held for lease. The carrying values of assets held for lease were approximately $7.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2013.  

Finance and financial products liabilities were $18.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $19.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, which included notes payable and other borrowings of $12.7 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, notes payable included $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC). In 2014, BHFC issued $1.15 billion of senior unsecured notes to replace maturing notes. The new senior notes mature in 2017 and 2018. An additional $1.0 billion of BHFC debt matured in January 2015 and at that time BHFC issued $1.0 billion of new senior notes that mature in 2017 and 2018. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to fund originated loans and acquired loans of Clayton Homes.  

As described in Note 12 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, our finance and financial products businesses are party to equity index put option and credit default contracts. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshires credit ratings. At December 31, 2014, the liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $4.8 billion and we had no collateral posting requirements. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes and payment of amounts due at the expiration of the equity index put option and credit default contracts is guaranteed by Berkshire.  

We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations.  

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act) was signed into law. The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized during the next several months. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.

Contractual Obligations  

We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included in the following table to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.  

The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future claim settlement activities or events. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. These amounts are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded under reinsurance contracts, receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table.  

A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 follows. Amounts are in millions.

 (2)   Before reserve discounts of $1,745 million.  

 (3)   Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Except for certain workers compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value. The timing and amount of loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the final determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate liabilities payable in the future. In establishing liability estimates at our various insurance operations, we utilize processes and techniques that are believed to best suit the underlying claims and available data.  

As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement or payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails.  

Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders.  

Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.  

GEICO  

GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2014 were $12.2 billion compared to $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. Liabilities at December 31, 2014 included $8.6 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $3.6 billion of IBNR reserves.  

GEICOs claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yield an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity).  

Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant liability components (and percentage of GEICOs gross liabilities as of December 31, 2014) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%) and (3) IBNR reserves (30%). Each of these liability components is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Liabilities are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each liability component follows.  

We establish average reserves for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for claims when adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Aggregate average reserves are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.  

Claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss reserve estimates once the facts and merits of each claim are evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised over time as more information becomes available.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

GEICO (Continued)  

Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages (such as bodily injury (BI), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation, and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is first established. As a result case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of ultimate cost, so we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2014, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of the established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves and are reviewed and revised periodically. Approximately 92% of GEICOs reserves as of December 31, 2014 were for automobile liability coverages, of which BI coverage accounted for approximately 55%.  

For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are deducted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management personnel.  

For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the aggregate liabilities for unpaid losses using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.  

Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimates recorded at the end of 2013 developed downward by $386 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2014, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2014. These reserve developments represented approximately 1.9% of earned premiums in 2014 and approximately 3.6% of prior year-end recorded net liabilities. During 2013, estimated liabilities for pre-2013 occurrences developed downward $238 million or 2.4% of net liabilities as of the end of 2012. In both years, the downward development reflected overall lower than expected frequencies and severities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2014 were modified as appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated.  

We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $185 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.  

GEICOs exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently an immaterial component of GEICOs total reserves (approximately 1.2%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure.  

General Re and BHRG  

Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of General Re and BHRG derive primarily from reinsurance contracts. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies.  

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract, if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Loss information may be reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports, which may include currently recoverable losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re and BHRG (Continued)  

Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients in order to establish adequate liability estimates. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting.  

The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurers. In some instances, multiple reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays are compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reasons.  

Periodic premium and claims reports are often required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period.  

Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, BHRG and General Re are permitted under the contracts to access the cedants books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem appropriate.  

In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  

General Re  

General Res gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2014 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Net of discounts of $1,745 million.  

 (2)   Includes directors and officers, errors and omissions, medical malpractice and umbrella coverage.  

General Res loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case loss estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded liabilities are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period.  

We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such ranges to be unreliable.

Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2014, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.0 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result.  

Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, and workers compensation), and jurisdiction. For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. Globally, we review approximately 1,200 reserve cells.  

We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence and development patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, we calculate IBNR reserves. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we may use loss emergence estimation formulae along with other loss triangles and actuarial judgment to determine loss emergence patterns. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.  

We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell and by accident year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratios and forecasted losses obtained from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premiums. If through subsequent development the selected loss emergence pattern proves to be inaccurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may be inaccurate, which can then impact the selected loss ratios and the IBNR reserve. Actuarial judgment is necessary in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing statistics.  

We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year, based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.  

Our recorded net liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $14.8 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively. During 2014, we reduced net losses for prior years occurrences by $410 million and in 2013 we reduced net losses for prior years occurrences by $728 million. These reductions produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings in each year.  

In 2014, reported claims for prior years workers compensation losses were $219 million less than expected. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves. These developments precipitated an increase of $120 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences and after adjusting for changes in reserve discounts, the net increase in workers compensation losses from prior years occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $824 million and $471 million on a discounted basis at December 31, 2014. An increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re (Continued)  

Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed favorably in 2014 relative to expectations. However, casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year will continue in the future. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells, we estimate that an increase of five points in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.1 billion. This amount includes changes in assumptions used in certain U.K. motor annuity claims liabilities. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $1.1 billion.  

In 2014, reported claims for prior years property loss events were less than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $287 million. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses.  

In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected loss emergence patterns. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of five points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern (for those cells where loss emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of five percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $77 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.  

Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $1.5 billion and net of reinsurance were approximately $1.2 billion. Mass tort net claims paid were $71 million in 2014. In 2014, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $72 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios based on average net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 14.9 years as of December 31, 2014 and 15.6 years as of December 31, 2013. The reinsurance industrys survival ratio for asbestos and pollution liabilities was approximately 14.2 years as of December 31, 2013.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

In general, the methodologies we use to establish BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments are employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change.  

Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our retroactive reinsurance policies were approximately $24.3 billion, and were predominately for casualty or liability coverages. Retroactive reinsurance policies relate to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date and include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified and contracts that indemnify losses paid by the counterparty immediately after the policy effective date. These contracts may include significant exposures to asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. We do not retrocede liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts to third party reinsurers.  

The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since such amounts are derived from ceding company reports which may employ varying definitions of case reserves. We review and establish loss reserve estimates in the aggregate by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends.  

In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process.  

BHRGs liabilities under retroactive reinsurance include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses of approximately $12.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $11.9 billion at December 31, 2013. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future.  

We increased ultimate liabilities for prior years retroactive reinsurance contracts by approximately $825 million in 2014 and $300 million in 2013. In both years, the increases primarily related to asbestos and environmental risks assumed. The increase in 2014, net of deferred charge balances adjustments related to changes in estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid liabilities, produced charges to pre-tax earnings of approximately $450 million in 2014. In 2013, the impact of the increase on pre-tax earnings was relatively insignificant. Our aggregate net payments of retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses approximated $1.1 billion in 2014 and $1.3 billion in 2013.  

We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed approximately $40 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also believe it unlikely that our reported year end 2014 gross unpaid losses of $24.3 billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%.  

Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from BHRGs property and casualty contracts, other than retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 and consisted of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties, and to a lesser extent, under individual risk contracts. These coverages included catastrophe and aviation contracts that periodically generate low frequency/high severity losses. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

Under most of our non-catastrophe property and casualty treaties, liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustments expenses are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by managements estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. For BHRGs property/casualty contracts other than retroactive reinsurance, we decreased estimated ultimate losses for prior years occurrences by approximately $889 million in 2014 and $714 million in 2013. In both years, the decreases primarily derived from lower than expected losses reported by ceding companies. These decreases produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings in 2014 and 2013.  

Derivative contract liabilities  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets. Certain elements of the terms and conditions of these contracts are not standard and we are not required to post collateral under most of these contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are based on valuation models that we believe would be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options are inherently subjective. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model.  

We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2014 were 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively, and were 2.5% and 3.6%, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. The interest rates as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately 53 basis points and 64 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component.  

The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 6 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 20.9%, compared to 20.7% as of December 31, 2013. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2014 ($4.6 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For several years, we also have had exposures relating to a number of credit default contracts written involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. At December 31, 2014, our remaining exposures relate to state/municipality exposures which begin to expire in 2019. The fair values of our state/municipality contracts are generally based on pricing data and current ratings on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions.

Other Critical Accounting Policies  

We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $7.8 billion at December 31, 2014. Significant changes in the estimated amount and the timing of payments of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $60.7 billion, which includes approximately $4.0 billion associated with our various acquisitions in 2014. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2014. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.  

Market Risk Disclosures  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.  

Interest Rate Risk  

We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks.  

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments.

Interest Rate Risk (Continued)  

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Excludes other investments that are not subject to a significant level of interest rate risk.  

Equity Price Risk  

Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2014, approximately 59% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated within four companies.  

We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.  

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.  

We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract.

Equity Price Risk (Continued)  

The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Excludes other investments that do not possess significant equity price risk.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies such as The Coca-Cola Company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy subsidiaries, and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries, as well as through our investments in Heinz that are accounted for under the equity method. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.  

Commodity Price Risk  

Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at BHE. BHEs exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints.

Commodity Price Risk (Continued)  

To mitigate a portion of the risk, BHE uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. The table that follows summarizes commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of BHE as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.
