Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates.

We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.

Fiscal 2015 

As of June 27, 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Total debt as of June 27, 2015 was $7.3 billion, of which approximately 74% was at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement. Included in the total debt amount is $5.0 billion in senior notes that were issued in October 2014, for the proposed merger with US Foods. The October 2014 senior notes contained mandatory redemption features providing that, on the earlier of the merger agreement termination date or October 8, 2015, we were required to redeem all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal of the senior notes plus accrued interest. In June 2015, we terminated the merger agreement and redeemed the senior notes in July 2015 using cash on hand and the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper facility. 

In August 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted $500.0 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 to floating rate debt. In October 2014, we also entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $500.0 million of the new senior notes maturing on October 2, 2017 and $750.0 million of the new senior notes maturing on October 2, 2019 to floating rate debt (2014 swaps). These transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the change in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates. 

Our 2014 swaps were terminated in July 2015. Details of our outstanding swap agreements at June 27, 2015, are below:

 In January 2014, in contemplation of securing financing and hedging interest rate risk relating to our assumption or refinancing of the net debt of US Foods that was scheduled to occur upon closing of the proposed merger (discussed in Note 4, “Acquisitions”), we entered into two forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $2.0 billion. We designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on 10-year and 30-year debt issued in fiscal 2015. In September 2014, in conjunction with the pricing of the $1.25 billion senior notes maturing on October 2, 2024 and $1 billion senior notes maturing October 2, 2044, we terminated these swaps, locking in the effective yields on the related debt. Cash of $58.9 million was paid to settle the 10-year swap in September 2014, and cash of $129.9 million was paid to settle the 30-year swap in October 2014. 

The following tables present our interest rate position as of June 27, 2015. All amounts are stated in United States (U.S.) dollar equivalents.

Rate A – six-month LIBOR

Rate B – three-month LIBOR

(1) 0.22% for notional amount of $500,000 maturing on October 2, 2017 and .046% for notional amount of $750,000 maturing on October 2, 2019

(2) 1.45% for notional amount of $500,000 maturing on October 2, 2017 and 2.35% for notional amount of $750,000 maturing on October 2, 2019

In August 2015, the company entered into two forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $500 million. The company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce interest rate exposure on forecasted 10-year debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates for debt the company expects to issue in fiscal 2016.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 1.0% in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014. The exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 0.7% in fiscal 2014 when compared to fiscal 2013. The impact to our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2015 weighted year-to-date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2015 sales by 1.2% and would not have materially impacted our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share. We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks.

Fuel Price Risk

Due to the nature of our distribution business, we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices. The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers. During fiscal 2015 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.6% of sales. For fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, these costs represented approximately 0.7% of sales. 

Our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven, improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges. We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of June 27, 2015, we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately $99.3 million through June 2016. These contracts will lock in the price of approximately 40% to 45% of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel. Our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price at a later date. Using current, published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption, a 10% unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately $15 million in our fuel costs on our non-contracted volumes.

Investment Risk

Our company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) holds investments in public and private equity, fixed income securities and real estate funds. The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon, among other things, the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability. Fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year-end, which is when this plan’s funded status is measured. Also, the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets. To the extent the financial markets experience declines, our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years. A 10% unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company-sponsored Retirement Plan at the plan’s fiscal year end (December 31, 2014) would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2016; however, this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2016 by $31.0 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of June 27, 2015 by $300.3 million.
