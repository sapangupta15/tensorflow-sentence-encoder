ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world.

The Company’s business depends on the strength of the retail, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent Europe, Latin America and Asia. These sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry, which, in turn, are affected by general economic conditions. With continuing challenging global economic conditions, particularly outside the U.S., there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the Company’s products, as well as its financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions, including the deterioration in the creditworthiness of, or a default by, the issuers of sovereign debt. Such events could negatively impact the Company’s overall liquidity and/or create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions. Consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and e-commerce companies.

The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products, many of which are large and well-established. The Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, has contributed to the formation of dominant multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Current trends among retailers and e-commerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive, economic or other factors, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. Other trends are for retailers and e-commerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands, typically at lower prices, that compete with the Company’s products.

 10
The combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers, such as overall store and inventory reductions. The intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. In particular, a loss of, or a failure by, one of the Company’s large customers could adversely impact the Company’s sales and operating cash flows. To address these challenges, the Company must be able to respond to competitive factors, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases.

The Company’s customers may further consolidate, which could adversely affect its sales and margins. 

The Company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades. In 2013, two of the Company’s large customers, Office Depot and OfficeMax, completed their previously announced merger. In February 2015, Staples and Office Depot announced plans to merge. The Company currently expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers, close retail outlets and rationalize their supply chain, which could negatively impact the Company’s sales and margins and adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that following consolidation, the Company’s large customers will continue to buy from the Company across different product categories or geographic regions, or at the same levels as prior to consolidation, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results. Further, if the consolidation trend continues, it could result in future pressures that could reduce the Company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful, which would adversely affect its ability to compete.

The Company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies, reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling, general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a best-cost position and allow the Company to invest in innovation and brand building, including advertising and promotion. The Company is currently in the process of implementing Project Renewal, a global initiative designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the Company’s most significant growth platforms. Project Renewal may not be completed substantially as planned, may be more costly to implement than expected, or may not result in, in full or in part, the positive effects anticipated. In addition, such initiatives require the Company to implement a significant amount of organizational change, which could have a negative impact on employee engagement, divert management’s attention from other concerns, and if not properly managed, impact the Company’s ability to retain key employees, cause disruptions in the Company’s day-to-day operations and have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. It is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future.

If the Company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand, the Company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted.

The Company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation. Its long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the Company’s products. In addition, sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the Company’s existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, the Company’s financial results could be adversely affected.

If the Company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.

The Company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the Company’s retailer and other customers will need the Company’s products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow the Company to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While the Company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.

 11
Price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the Company’s financial results.

The Company purchases raw materials, including resin, principally polyethylene, polypropylene and copolyester, corrugate, steel, gold, brass and aluminum, which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures. The Company’s success is dependent, in part, on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs, including periodic purchases, future delivery purchases, long-term contracts, sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Also, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for its products. These manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures, which may, in turn, result in an increase in the amount the Company pays for sourced products. Raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the Company’s productivity gains and price increases and adversely impact the Company’s financial results.

If the Company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses, the Company’s future growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.

The Company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully remain important factors in the Company’s future growth. In 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Ignite and Baby Jogger and the assets of bubba and in 2015, completed the acquisition of Elmer's Products, Inc. The Company’s ability to successfully integrate these or any other acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired, obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time, assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, and manage unanticipated demands on the Company’s management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Furthermore, the Company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the Company’s financial position and access to credit markets. In addition, significant additional borrowings would increase the Company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the Company’s future access to capital. The Company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring and integrating a business or product line, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company continually evaluates the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products. In August 2015, the Company sold its Rubbermaid medical cart business, and in November 2015, the Company completed the sale of the Endicia on-line postage business. In October 2015, the Company announced that it intends to divest its Décor business, which comprises its Levolor® and Kirsch® window coverings brands. The Company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit. A decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and losses upon disposition, both of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner. In addition, prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing. Divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks, including the following:

•difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel;

•the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;

•the retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture;

•the disruption of the Company’s business; and

•the potential loss of key employees.

The Company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model.

International operations are important to the Company’s business, and the Company’s strategy emphasizes international growth. In addition, as the Company sources products in low-cost countries, particularly in Asia, it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties. Foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation; other currency fluctuations; tariffs; nationalization; exchange controls; price controls; labor inflation; interest rates; limitations on foreign investment in local business; compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and other political, economic and regulatory risks and difficulties. The Company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in reliance on foreign sourcing.

 12
The Company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the Company’s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

The financial position and results of operations of many of the Company’s international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the Company’s financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the Company’s reported sales, operating margin and operating income (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. Dollar has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency unfavorably affected reported sales by $331 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The volatility of foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The margin impacts from changes in foreign currency are because the Company’s costs for produced and sourced products are largely denominated in U.S. Dollars, and the Company’s international operations generally sell the Company’s products at prices denominated in local currencies. When local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. Dollar in the regions in which the Company sells products whose costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, the Company’s international businesses would need to increase the local currency sales prices of the products and/or reduce costs through productivity or other initiatives in order to maintain the same level of profitability. The Company may not be able to increase the selling prices of its products in its international businesses due to market dynamics, competition or otherwise and may not realize cost reductions through productivity or other initiatives. As a result, gross margins and overall operating results of the Company’s international businesses would be adversely affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens.

The Company has been adversely impacted by developments in Venezuela, including the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan Bolivar that have occurred in recent years, the declining availability of U.S. Dollars and the implementation of pricing and exchange controls in Venezuela. In 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a Law on Fair Pricing which established a maximum profit margin of 30%, thereby limiting the Company’s ability to implement price increases, which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. In 2015, the Venezuelan government adopted additional regulations requiring the Company to identify the ultimate retail price to consumers on products it sells and further limit maximum profit margins on certain products to 20%, both of which adversely affected the prices the Company charges to its distributor customers and its distribution channels and route-to-market. As a result of increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to U.S. Dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms, the Company concluded that an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan Bolivar and the U.S. Dollar existed as of December 31, 2015. The exchange restrictions and other regulations have impacted the Company’s ability to make key operational and financial decisions regarding its Venezuelan operations and benefit from the earnings of its Venezuelan operations. The Company determined that it no longer could exercise control over the operations of its Venezuela subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuela subsidiary on December 31, 2015 and recorded a pretax charge of $172.7 million. 

Future government actions, such as currency devaluations, import authorization controls, foreign exchange controls, price or profit controls or expropriation or other forms of government take-over, could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the Company’s ability to manufacture and market its products.

The Company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. The Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners. Most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis; however, in limited cases where the Company has supply contracts with fixed prices, the Company may be required to purchase raw materials at above-market prices, which could adversely impact gross margins. In addition, in some instances the Company maintains single-source or limited-source sourcing relationships, either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. In particular, the Company’s Baby & Parenting business has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of Baby & Parenting’s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products. In addition, certain businesses in the Company’s Home Solutions segment rely on a single source of supply for a majority of their products. Financial, operating or other difficulties encountered by the Company’s suppliers and/or sourcing partners or changes in the Company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies, and prevent the Company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to manufacture and market its products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

 13
A failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business or reputation.

The Company relies extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:

•ordering and managing materials from suppliers; 

•converting materials to finished products; 

•shipping products to customers; 

•marketing and selling products to consumers; 

•collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; 

•processing transactions; 

•summarizing and reporting results of operations;

•hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; 

•complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; 

•providing data security; and 

•handling other processes necessary to manage the Company’s business. 

Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company’s data. If the IT systems, networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly, or if the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and/or financial condition.

Impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.

Future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the Company’s assets and require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Company’s sales and customer base, the unfavorable resolution of litigation, a material adverse change in the Company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners, or a sustained decline in the Company’s stock price. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the Company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Accordingly, the Company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future.

The Company’s businesses are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.

Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other regulations. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the Company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company’s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company’s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. For example, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada are advocating for more strict design standards for window blinds that if implemented, would require the Company to redesign a large number of window blinds products sold in the U.S. and Canada. For certain products, redesign may not be possible or practical, and as a result, the Company would lose revenues from the sales of such products.

As a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S. until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company’s financial results could be impacted.

 14
The Company may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.

The Company’s success at implementing Project Renewal and the Growth Game Plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.

The resolution of the Company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows and results of operations.

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals. There can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its end-user brands.

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the Company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the Company’s business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace, adversely impact the value of its end-user brands, or result in an increase in the cost of producing the Company’s products. The Company could also be required to recall possibly defective products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a self-insured deductible and may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, while certain costs, such as recall expenses and government fines, are outside the scope of the Company's insurance coverage.

A reduction in the Company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company’s current senior debt credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are Baa3, BBB- and BBB+, respectively. Its current short-term debt credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are P-3, A-3 and F-2, respectively. Moody’s has a stable outlook on its ratings, and Standard & Poor’s and Fitch have a negative outlook on their ratings. The Company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A downgrade by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, which would reduce the Company’s senior debt below investment-grade, could increase the Company’s borrowing costs, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial results. The Company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. If the Company’s short-term ratings were to be lowered, it would limit, or eliminate entirely, the Company’s access to the commercial paper market. The ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company’s securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

The level of returns on pension and post-retirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the Company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in government regulations could also affect the Company’s pension and post-retirement plan expenses and funding requirements.

The funding obligations for the Company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, the Company could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore the Company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the Company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity.

 15
Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are determined by the Company in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that the Company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected health care costs, or mortality rates, the Company’s future pension and post-retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that the Company uses may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s pension and post-retirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.

Risks Related to the Proposed Merger Transactions with Jarden Corporation

The Company is subject to various risks related to the proposed merger transactions with Jarden.

As described elsewhere is this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has entered into the Merger Agreement with Jarden pursuant to which the Company will acquire Jarden in the Proposed Merger Transactions (as defined below). The risks, contingencies and other uncertainties that could result in the failure of the Proposed Merger Transactions to be completed or, if completed, that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the Company following the Proposed Merger Transactions, and any anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger Transactions to the Company, include:

•the failure to obtain necessary regulatory or other approvals for the Proposed Merger Transactions, which could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Proposed Merger Transactions or otherwise have a material adverse effect on Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden, or if obtained, the possibility of Newell Rubbermaid being subjected to conditions that could reduce or delay the expected cost savings and other benefits of the Proposed Merger Transactions;

•the failure to obtain necessary stockholder approvals for the share issuance and the adoption of the Merger Agreement;

•the obligation of Newell Rubbermaid to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions even if financing is not available or is available only on terms other than those currently anticipated;

•the failure to satisfy required closing conditions or complete the Proposed Merger Transactions in a timely manner or at all;

•the effect of the announcement of the Proposed Merger Transactions on each company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, maintain business relationships, and on operating results and the businesses generally;

•the effect of restrictions placed on Newell Rubbermaid’s and Jarden’s respective subsidiaries’ business activities and ability to pursue alternatives to the Proposed Merger Transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement;

•the terms and availability of indebtedness planned to be incurred in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions;

•the risk that the Company may not be able to maintain its investment grade rating;

•the potential impact of the Proposed Merger Transactions on the stock price of the Company, and the dividends expected to be paid to Company stockholders in the future;

•the failure to realize projected cost savings and other benefits from the Proposed Merger Transactions;

•the incurrence of significant pre- and post-transaction related costs in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions that are, and will be, incurred regardless of whether the Proposed Merger Transactions are completed; and

•the occurrence of any event giving rise to the right of a party to terminate the Merger Agreement.

The future results of the Company following the Proposed Merger Transactions will suffer if Newell Brands does not effectively manage its expanded operations or successfully integrate the businesses of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden.

Following the Proposed Merger Transactions, the size of the business of Newell Brands will increase significantly beyond the current size of either Newell Rubbermaid’s or Jarden’s business. Newell Brands’ future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. If Newell Brands is not able to successfully combine the businesses of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden in an efficient and effective manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of common stock of Newell Brands may be affected adversely. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Newell Brands, which may adversely affect the value of its common stock following the Proposed Merger Transactions. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what Newell Brands expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. 

 16
Uncertainties associated with the Proposed Merger Transactions may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could affect the future business and operations of the Company following the Proposed Merger Transactions.

The success of the Proposed Merger Transactions will depend in part on Newell Brands’ ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by Jarden and by the Company. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Jarden or with the Company, as applicable, while the Proposed Merger Transactions are pending or with Newell Brands after the Proposed Merger Transactions are consummated. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, Newell Brands’ business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the businesses to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Newell Brands’ business to suffer. In addition, the Company and Jarden may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. 

Newell Rubbermaid may encounter difficulties or high costs associated with securing financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration.

Newell Rubbermaid currently intends to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration for the Proposed Merger Transactions and related fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions, to refinance approximately $4.5 billion of outstanding Jarden debt and to assume two tranches of outstanding Jarden debt with principal amounts of $300 million and €300 million, with up to approximately $10.1 billion of new debt expected to be incurred in the form of (1) up to approximately $8.6 billion of newly issued Newell Rubbermaid debt securities and the $1.5 billion term loan facility, depending on market conditions at the time of obtaining the financing and available cash balances, and (2) available balance sheet cash. To the extent necessary, Newell Rubbermaid may also fund all or a portion of the cash portion of the merger consideration from borrowings under the bridge credit facility, as contemplated by the commitment letter with a lender, or from borrowings under other permanent or alternative financing.

Newell Rubbermaid expects to pursue financing that would replace or supplement financing available under the bridge credit facility. There is no guarantee that replacement or supplemental financing will be available to Newell Rubbermaid on acceptable terms or at all. Newell Rubbermaid’s ability to obtain financing to replace or supplement the commitment under the bridge credit facility will be subject to various factors, including market conditions, operating performance and credit ratings, and may be subject to restrictions in the agreements relating to Newell Rubbermaid’s outstanding debt.

The receipt of financing by Newell Rubbermaid is not a condition to the completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions and, except in certain limited circumstances in which Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden may be permitted to terminate the Proposed Merger Transactions if (1) the proceeds to be provided to Newell Rubbermaid pursuant to the bridge credit facility sufficient to consummate the Proposed Merger Transactions are not available and (2) a debt rating failure has occurred, Newell Rubbermaid will be required to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions (assuming that all of the conditions to its obligations under the Merger Agreement are satisfied). Newell Rubbermaid would be obligated to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions whether or not the bridge credit facility or other financing is available on acceptable terms or at all.

The substantial additional indebtedness that the Company will incur in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions could materially adversely affect Newell Brands and its financial position after the Proposed Merger Transactions, including by decreasing Newell Brands’ business flexibility, increasing its borrowing costs and resulting in a reduction of Newell Brands’ credit ratings.

Following completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions, Newell Brands will have substantially increased debt compared to Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden on a recent historical basis. Newell Rubbermaid expects to incur more than $5.0 billion of additional debt (excluding approximately $4.5 billion of Jarden debt expected to be refinanced in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions and two tranches of outstanding Jarden debt with principal amounts of $300 million and €300 million expected to be assumed by Newell Brands in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions), assuming the conversion of all Jarden’s convertible notes into shares of Jarden common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration in connection with the completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions. This increased level of debt could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Newell Brands’ flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will have the effect of increasing Newell Brands’ interest expense. In addition, if Newell Brands is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness following the Proposed Merger Transactions, Newell Brands will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources, which could increase its total debt-to- capitalization ratios, decrease its interest coverage ratios or otherwise result in a breach of the covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Newell Brands.

Newell Rubbermaid’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, Newell Rubbermaid’s cost of capital. Newell Rubbermaid’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of Newell Rubbermaid’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet Newell Rubbermaid’s debt obligations. Following announcement of the 

 17
Proposed Merger Transactions, Standard & Poor’s ratings services reaffirmed all of its ratings on Newell Rubbermaid, including its BBB- corporate credit rating, Moody’s reaffirmed Newell Rubbermaid’s Baa3 senior unsecured rating and Fitch reaffirmed Newell Rubbermaid’s BBB+ long-term issuer default rating, although Fitch indicated it anticipates a downgrade from BBB+ to BBB- upon completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions. There can be no assurance any of the rating agencies will not downgrade the Company’s credit rating upon completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions, and any reduction in Newell Rubbermaid’s credit ratings, either on a corporate basis or any one or more debt issuances or under the bridge credit facility (as contemplated by the commitment letter with a lender) or otherwise, may limit Newell Rubbermaid’s ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates currently available or available to Newell Rubbermaid prior to the Proposed Merger Transactions. Any impairment of Newell Rubbermaid’s ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on Newell Rubbermaid’s ability to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration through the issuance of debt securities or another alternative to borrowings under the bridge credit facility on terms more favorable than those contemplated by the bridge credit facility, or to refinance the bridge credit facility, if drawn.

The Proposed Merger Transactions are subject to a number of conditions to the obligations of both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions, which, if not fulfilled, or not fulfilled in a timely manner, may result in termination of the Merger Agreement. 

The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions to completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions, including, among others: 

•approval of the share issuance by Newell Rubbermaid stockholders;

•adoption of the Merger Agreement by Jarden stockholders;

•effectiveness under the Securities Act of Newell Rubbermaid’s Form S-4 registration statement relating to the offer, sale and issuance of the Newell Rubbermaid common stock in connection with the share issuance and the absence of any stop order in respect thereof or proceedings by the SEC for that purpose;

•expiration or termination of the applicable HSR Act waiting period and the affirmative approval of antitrust and competition authorities or expiration of waiting periods in certain other specified jurisdictions;

•the absence of laws, orders, judgments and injunctions that restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions;

•subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to the businesses of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden and compliance by Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden with their respective covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; and

•the absence of a material adverse effect relating to Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden.

Many of the conditions to completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions are not within either Newell Rubbermaid’s or Jarden’s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to July 31, 2016, which may be extended by either Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden up to two times, each for an additional 45 day period, it is possible that the Merger Agreement may be terminated. Although Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to certain limitations, to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions as promptly as practicable, these and other conditions to the completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions may fail to be satisfied. In addition, satisfying the conditions to and completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions may take longer, and could cost more, than Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden expect. Neither Newell Rubbermaid nor Jarden can predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the Proposed Merger Transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring. Any delay in completing the Proposed Merger Transactions may adversely affect the cost savings and other benefits that Newell Rubbermaid expects to achieve if the Proposed Merger Transactions and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe. 

Failure to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions could negatively impact Newell Rubbermaid’s or Jarden’s stock price and have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 

If the Proposed Merger Transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden stockholders failing to approve the applicable proposals, the ongoing businesses of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Proposed Merger Transactions, Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 

•Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on their respective stock prices;

•Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden and their respective subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from their respective customers, distributors, regulators, vendors and employees;

 18
•Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Proposed Merger Transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;

•Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden may be required to pay one or more cash termination fees as required by the Merger Agreement;

•the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the respective businesses pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which may have delayed or prevented the respective companies from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, may have been pursued; 

•matters relating to the Proposed Merger Transactions (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by each company’s management, which could have resulted in the distraction of each company’s management from ongoing business operations and pursing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the companies; and

•litigation related to any failure to complete the Proposed Merger Transactions or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden to perform their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.

For example, the Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including termination by Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden to enter into a definitive agreement for a proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden, as applicable, will be required to pay the other a cash termination fee equal to $385 million. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either party due to a failure to obtain the applicable necessary stockholder approval, Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden, as applicable, will be required to reimburse the other for up to $100 million for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Proposed Merger Transactions. Newell Rubbermaid could also be required to pay a termination fee of $900 million to Jarden and terminate the Merger Agreement under certain conditions if it is unable to obtain financing contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the bridge credit facility (as contemplated by the commitment letter with a lender), and is otherwise unable to secure alternative investment grade financing.

If the Proposed Merger Transactions are not completed, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and stock prices.
