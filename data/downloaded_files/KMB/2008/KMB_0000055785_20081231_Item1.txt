ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

Kimberly-Clark Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The Corporation is a global health and hygiene company focused on product innovation and building its personal care, consumer tissue, K-C Professional & Other and health care brands. The Corporation is principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of health and hygiene products around the world. Most of these products are made from natural or synthetic fibers using advanced technologies in fibers, nonwovens and absorbency. As used in Items 1, 1A, 2, 3, 6, 7, 7A, 8 and 9A of this Form 10-K, the term Corporation refers to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the remainder of this Form 10-K, the terms Kimberly-Clark or Corporation refer only to Kimberly-Clark Corporation. For financial information by business segment and geographic area, and information about principal products and markets of the Corporation, reference is made to Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to Item 8, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Recent Developments  

On July 23, 2007, the Corporation entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement) through which it purchased approximately 29.6 million shares of its common stock from Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America), at an initial purchase price of $67.48 per share, or an aggregate of $2 billion. On July 30, 2007, the Corporation issued $2.1 billion of long-term notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of these notes to repay a short-term revolving credit agreement, under which the Corporation borrowed $2 billion on July 27, 2007 to fund the settlement of the ASR Agreement. In March 2008, the Corporation and Bank of America settled the ASR Agreement. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Notes 6 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the ASR Agreement.  

In July 2005, the Corporation authorized a multi-year plan to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North America and Europe. The strategic cost reductions were completed in 2008. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the strategic cost reduction plan.  

Description of the Corporation  

The Corporation is organized into operating segments based on product groupings. These operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; K-C Professional & Other; and Health Care. The reportable segments were determined in accordance with how the Corporations executive managers develop and execute the Corporations global strategies to drive growth and profitability of the Corporations worldwide Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, K-C Professional & Other and Health Care operations. These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses.  

The principal sources of revenue in each of our global business segments are described below. Revenue, profit and total assets of each reportable segment are shown in Item 8, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Personal Care segment manufactures and markets disposable diapers, training and youth pants, and swimpants; baby wipes; feminine and incontinence care products; and related products. Products in this segment are primarily for household use and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, Kotex, Lightdays, Depend, Poise and other brand names.

The K-C Professional & Other segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products for the away-from-home marketplace. Products in this segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex, Scott, WypAll, Kimtech, KleenGuard and Kimcare brand names.  

The Health Care segment manufactures and markets disposable health care products such as surgical gowns, drapes, infection control products, sterilization wrap, face masks, exam gloves, respiratory products and other disposable medical products. Products in this segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Ballard and other brand names.  

Products for household use are sold directly, and through wholesalers, to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, warehouse clubs, variety and department stores and other retail outlets. Products for away-from-home use are sold through distributors and directly to manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, health care establishments and high volume public facilities. In addition, certain products are sold to converters.  

Net sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were approximately 14 percent in 2008 and 2007, and approximately 13 percent in 2006.  

Patents and Trademarks  

The Corporation owns various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries. The Corporation considers the patents and trademarks which it owns and the trademarks under which it sells certain of its products to be material to its business. Consequently, the Corporation seeks patent and trademark protection by all available means, including registration.  

Raw Materials  

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered waste paper, is the primary raw material for the Corporations tissue products and is a component in disposable diapers, training pants, feminine pads and incontinence care products.  

Superabsorbent materials are important components in disposable diapers, training and youth pants and incontinence care products. Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics, which are used in disposable diapers, training and youth pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence and health care products, and away-from-home wipers.  

Most recovered paper, synthetics, pulp and recycled fiber are purchased from third parties. The Corporation considers the supply of these raw materials to be adequate to meet the needs of its businesses. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.  

Competition  

The Corporation has several major competitors in most of its markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than the Corporation. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. For additional discussion of the competitive environment in which the Corporation conducts its business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Environmental Matters

Of these amounts, approximately $15 million in 2009 and $2 million in 2010 are expected to be spent at facilities in the U.S. For facilities outside of the U.S., capital expenditures for environmental controls are expected to be approximately $24 million in 2009 and $10 million in 2010.  

Total worldwide operating expenses for environmental compliance are expected to be approximately $180 million in 2009 and $171 million in 2010. Operating expenses for environmental compliance with respect to U.S. facilities are expected to be approximately $93 million in 2009 and $83 million in 2010.

Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporations total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position. However, current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in the Corporations plans, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors.
