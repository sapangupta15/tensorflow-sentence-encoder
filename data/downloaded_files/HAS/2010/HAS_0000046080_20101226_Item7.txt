 Executive Summary  

 The Company earns revenue and generates cash primarily through the sale of a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with non-competing products, including digital games, offered by third parties. The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In 2010 and 2009, the second half of the year accounted for 65% of the Companys net revenues and, in 2008, the second half of the year accounted for 63% of the Companys net revenues. While many of the Companys products are based on brands and technology the Company owns or controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties, such as the MARVEL, STAR WARS and SESAME STREET properties.  

 The Companys business is separated into three principal business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the U.S. and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South American marketing and sales operations. The Companys Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Companys lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and online entertainment operations. In addition to these three primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment.  

 The Company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas important to its consumers. Brand awareness is amplified through immersive traditional play, digital applications, publishing and lifestyle licensing and entertainment experiences, including television programming and motion pictures, presented for consumers enjoyment. The Companys focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights, offering immersive entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the Companys brands across multiple forms and formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Companys operations to reduce costs, increase operating profits and maintain a strong balance sheet. The Companys core brands represent Company-owned or Company-controlled brands, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE and NERF, which have been successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to maintain a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2010 the Company had significant revenues from core brands, namely NERF, LITTLEST PET SHOP, TRANSFORMERS, FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAYSKOOL, PLAY-DOH, MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The Companys strategy of re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting its brands has been instrumental in achieving its overall long-term growth objectives.  

 The Company also seeks to drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment. As an example of this, in June of 2009, the TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN motion picture was released by Dreamworks, LLC and Paramount Pictures Corporation as a sequel to    

 23   
 the 2007 motion picture TRANSFORMERS. In addition, in August 2009, the motion picture G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA was released by Paramount Pictures Corporation. The Company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. In 2011, the Company expects the second TRANSFORMERS sequel, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON, to be released. As a result of pairing these core brands with motion picture entertainment, both the movies and the product lines benefited. In addition, the Company has entered into a strategic relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least three motion pictures based on certain of Hasbros core brands, with the potential for production of two additional pictures. The first movie under this relationship is expected to be released in 2012. As part of its strategy, in addition to using theatrical entertainment, the Company continues to seek opportunities to use other entertainment outlets and forms of entertainment as a way to build awareness of its brands.  

 The Company is a partner in a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. (Discovery) which runs THE HUB, a television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming. Programming on the network includes content based on Hasbros brands, Discoverys library of childrens educational programming, as well as programming developed by third parties. THE HUB debuted in October of 2010 and was available in approximately 60 million homes in the U.S. upon launch. In connection with its television initiative, the Company established Hasbro Studios, an internal wholly-owned production studio that is responsible for the creation and development of television programming based primarily on Hasbros brands. Hasbro Studios creates programming for distribution in the United States on THE HUB, and for distribution on other networks in international markets. The Company incurred a certain level of investment spending leading up to the debut of THE HUB in October 2010, as well as costs in 2010, and expected in the future, related to the production of television programming by Hasbro Studios. The Company believes that its television initiative of developing programming based on its brands for distribution in the United States and in international markets supports its strategy of growing its core brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format.  

 While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths. The Companys primary licenses include its agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (Marvel), for characters in the Marvel universe, including IRON MAN and SPIDER-MAN; Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (Lucas), related to the STAR WARS brand; and Sesame Workshop, related to the SESAME STREET characters. The majority of product offerings under the Sesame Workshop license will commence in 2011. During 2010 the Company had significant sales of products related to the movie release of IRON MAN 2 in May 2010 as well as continued strong sales of STAR WARS products. During 2009 the Company had a high level of revenues from products related to television programming based on SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS.  

 The Companys long-term strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world. As part of this strategy, the Company is party to a multi-year strategic agreement with Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA). The agreement gives EA the worldwide rights, subject to existing limitations on the Companys rights and certain other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on a broad spectrum of the Companys intellectual properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA, G.I. JOE and LITTLEST PET SHOP.  

 The Company is investing to grow its business in emerging markets. During the last two years, the Company expanded its operations in China, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Romania and the Czech Republic. In addition, the Company is seeking to grow its business in entertainment and digital gaming, and will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms of media.  

 While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth of its business, it also continues to be focused on reducing fixed costs through operating efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over the last 8 years    

 24   
 the Company has improved its full year operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 14.7% in 2010. The Company reviews its operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce the cost structure of its underlying business and promote efficiency.  

 The Company is committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, from 2005 to 2010, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) adopted five successive share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $2,325,000. The fifth authorization was approved in April 2010 for $625,000. At December 26, 2010, the Company had $150,068 remaining under the April 2010 authorization. In 2010, the Company invested $636,681 in the repurchase of 15,763 shares of common stock in the open market. For the years ended 2009 and 2008, the Company spent $90,994 and $357,589, respectively, to repurchase 3,172 and 11,736 shares, respectively, in the open market. The increased level of share repurchases in 2010 compared to 2009 partially reflects the Companys repurchase of an equivalent number of shares that were issued in 2010 in connection with the call and related conversion of its convertible debt. The Company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions, the Companys other potential uses of cash and the Companys levels of cash generation. In addition to the share repurchase program, the Company also seeks to return excess cash through the payment of quarterly dividends. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.30 per share from $0.25 per share.  

 Summary   

 The components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Results of Operations  

 Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2010 were fifty-two week periods.  

 Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2010 were $397,752, or $2.74 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2009 and 2008 of $374,930 and $306,766, or $2.48 and $2.00 per diluted share, respectively.  

 Net earnings for 2010 include a $0.15 per diluted share favorable impact resulting from the completion of a U.S. tax examination for the 2004 and 2005 tax years. Net earnings for 2010 and 2009 include dilution from    

 25   
 the Companys television investments, including the investment in the joint venture with Discovery and its issuance of $425,000 of long-term debt, both of which closed in May 2009, as well as the start-up of the Companys internal television studio, Hasbro Studios.  

 Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 were $4,002,161 compared to $4,067,947 in 2009 and $4,021,520 in 2008. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2010 were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $17,700 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2010 as compared to 2009. Consolidated net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $65,200 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 as compared to 2008.  

 The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for 2010, 2009 and 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 U.S. and Canada  

 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 decreased 6% to $2,299,547 from $2,447,943 in 2009. In 2010, net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation by approximately $10,300. The decrease in net revenues in 2010 was primarily due to decreased revenues in the boys toys category, primarily as a result of decreased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products. The 2009 sales of these lines benefited from the theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN in June 2009 and G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA in August 2009. Boys toys sales were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of STAR WARS products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of NERF products as well as increased sales of MARVEL products, which benefited from the theatrical release of IRON MAN 2 in May 2010. Boys toys sales were also positively impacted by the reintroduction of BEYBLADE products in the second half of 2010. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category also decreased in 2010 due to decreased sales of traditional board games and puzzles in the U.S. late in the year. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games. Sales in the girls category were flat in 2010. Increased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS products and, to a lesser extent, BABY ALIVE products were offset by decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP products. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP products decreased in 2010, sales of these products remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues. Net revenues in the preschool category increased in 2010 as the result of stronger sales of PLAY-DOH, TONKA and PLAYSKOOL products.  

 U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $349,594 in 2010 from $380,580 in 2009. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on U.S. and Canada operating profit in 2010. The decrease in U.S. and Canada operating profit was primarily driven by the decreased revenues in 2010 discussed above and, to a lesser extent, higher cost of sales as a percentage of those revenues due to a change in the mix of products sold. These decreases were partially offset by decreased royalty and amortization expense in 2010.   

 26   
 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 increased 2% to $2,447,943 from $2,406,745 in 2008. The increase in net revenues in 2009 was primarily due to increased revenues in the boys toys category, primarily as a result of increased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products due to the theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN in June 2009 and G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA in August 2009, as well as increased sales of NERF products. Increased sales in the boys toys category were partially offset by decreased sales of STAR WARS, MARVEL and INDIANA JONES products. The increase in U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for 2009 was also due to increased revenues in the preschool category primarily resulting from higher sales of TONKA and PLAY-DOH products, partially offset by decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL products. Revenues from sales of PLAYSKOOL products declined primarily as a result of decreased sales of ROSE PETAL COTTAGE products which are no longer in the Companys product line. Revenues from the girls toys category decreased primarily as a result of lower sales of BABY ALIVE and I-DOG products, partially offset by sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products which were reintroduced to the Companys line in the second quarter of 2009. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased slightly in 2009, primarily due to decreased sales of traditional board games, partially offset by increased revenues from sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been discontinued from the Companys product line.  

 U.S. and Canada operating profit increased to $380,580 in 2009 from $283,152 in 2008. Operating profit in 2009 was positively impacted by approximately $3,100 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. U.S. and Canada operating profit increased in 2009 primarily as a result of the increased revenues discussed above and lower cost of sales as a percentage of those revenues due to lower obsolescence charges and a change in the mix of products sold, primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in operating profit for 2009 also reflects decreased selling, distribution and administration expenses which primarily reflect lower shipping and distribution costs as well as decreased marketing and sales expenses. In addition, operating profit increased as a result of decreased advertising expense.  

 International  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 increased by 7% to $1,559,927 from $1,459,476 in 2009. In 2010, net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $27,600 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment net revenues increased 9% in local currency in 2010. The increased net revenues in 2010 were driven by increased sales in all categories as well as growth in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia and China. The increase in the boys toys category was primarily due to higher sales of NERF products as well as the reintroduction of BEYBLADE products in 2010. Increased sales of MARVEL and TONKA products also contributed to the increased sales in the boys toys category. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE lines. The increase in net revenues in the girls toys category was primarily driven by increased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS products partially offset by lower sales of MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP products. Preschool category net revenues increased primarily as the result of stronger sales of PLAY-DOH and PLAYSKOOL products offset by decreased sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category increased slightly as a result of increased revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games.  

 International segment operating profit increased 29% to $209,704 in 2010 from $162,159 in 2009. Operating profit for the International segment in 2010 was negatively impacted by approximately $11,500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the increased revenues described above. In addition, operating profit was positively impacted by decreased royalty expense and amortization. These were offset by increased selling, distribution and administrative expenses.  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 decreased by 3% to $1,459,476 from $1,499,334 in 2008. In 2009, net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $64,500 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign    

 27   
 exchange, International segment net revenues increased 2% in local currency in 2009. The increase in local currency net revenues was driven by increased sales in the boys toys category, primarily as a result of increased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products, as well as increased sales of NERF products which were partially offset by lower revenues from MARVEL, ACTION MAN, INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS products. Net revenues in the girls toys category decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and FURREAL FRIENDS products, partially offset by increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products and sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products, which were reintroduced to the Companys line in the second quarter of 2009. Net revenues in the preschool category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues from sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN and PLAYSKOOL products, partially offset by increased revenues from sales of PLAY-DOH products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased slightly as a result of decreased sales of board games. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been discontinued in the Companys product line.  

 International segment operating profit decreased 2% to $162,159 in 2009 from $165,186 in 2008. Operating profit for the International segment in 2009 was positively impacted by approximately $9,500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increased net revenues discussed above were more than offset by increased operating expenses, including the impact of our investments in opening offices in emerging international markets. In addition, International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom of approximately $6,000.  

 Entertainment and Licensing  

 The Entertainment and Licensing segments net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 decreased 12% to $136,488 from $155,013 for the year ended December 27, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in both lifestyle and digital gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to lower licensing revenues from TRANSFORMERS and, to a lesser extent, G.I. JOE, products following the motion picture releases in 2009.  

 Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit decreased 34% to $43,234 in 2010 from $65,572 in 2009. Operating profit decreased as a result of the decreased revenues discussed above and program production amortization costs associated with our television shows. This was partially offset by lower selling, distribution and administrative expenses. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses in 2009 were negatively impacted by approximately $7,200 in transaction costs related to the Companys investment in the joint venture with Discovery.  

 While the Discovery joint venture is a component of our television operations, the Companys 50% share in the earnings from the joint venture are included in other (income) expense and therefore are not a component of operating profit of the segment.  

 The Entertainment and Licensing segments net revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 increased 44% to $155,013 from $107,929 for the year ended December 28, 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher lifestyle and digital gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE licensed products.  

 Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased 28% to $65,572 in 2009 from $51,035 in 2008. Operating profit increased as a result of the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased selling, distribution and administrative expenses which included approximately $7,200 in transaction costs related to the Companys investment in the joint venture with Discovery, start-up costs associated with the Companys television studio, as well as increased intangible amortization and royalty expense.   

 28   
 Expenses  

 The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. In addition, 2010 cost of sales also includes amortization of television program production costs. Cost of sales increased to 42.8% for the year ended December 26, 2010 from 41.2% in 2009. In 2010, cost of sales includes $22,069 of television programming amortization. The remaining increase was partially due to a change in the mix of revenues. Increased cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues reflects a change in product mix primarily due to decreased sales of entertainment-based products in 2010 as compared to 2009. While cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of theatrical entertainment-based products are generally lower than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products, including Company owned or controlled brands based on a movie release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the benefit of these lower cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased to 41.2% for the year ended December 27, 2009 from 42.1% in 2008. The decrease was partially due to a change in the mix of revenues reflecting higher licensing revenues in 2009. In addition, the decrease reflects a change in product mix primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products in 2009 as compared to 2008. Cost of sales in 2009 were also positively impacted by lower obsolescence charges.  

 Royalty expense decreased to $248,570 or 6.2% of net revenues in 2010 compared to $330,651 or 8.1% of net revenues in 2009 and $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in 2008. The decrease in 2010 and the increase in 2009 primarily reflect the higher sales of entertainment-driven products in 2009, namely TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products. The increase in royalty expense in 2009 was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.  

 Product development expense increased in 2010 to $201,358 or 5.0% of net revenues compared to $181,195 or 4.5% of net revenues in 2009. This increase reflects costs associated with the development of products for introduction in 2011, including products related to the Companys agreement with Sesame Workshop. Product development expense decreased in 2009 to $181,195 or 4.5% of net revenues from $191,424 or 4.8% of net revenues in 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflected an effort to reduce the Companys overall SKU count and make development spending more efficient as part of the Companys ongoing cost control efforts.  

 Advertising expense increased to $420,651 or 10.5% of net revenues in 2010 compared to $412,580 or 10.1% of net revenues in 2009. This increase reflects the decrease in entertainment-driven products in 2010, which do not require the same level of advertising that the Company spends on non-entertainment based products. In addition, the increase in 2010 reflects a lower revenue base due to the decline in U.S. sales late in the year as well as increased advertising rates in 2010. Advertising expense decreased to $412,580 or 10.1% of net revenues in 2009 compared to $454,612 or 11.3% of net revenues in 2008. In years in which the Company has significant sales of products related to major motion picture releases, such as in 2009, advertising expense as a percentage of revenue is generally lower, as such products do not require the same level of advertising that the Company spends on non-entertainment based products. The decrease in advertising expense in 2009 also reflects lower advertisement placement costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange.  

 Amortization expense decreased to $50,405 or 1.3% of net revenues in 2010 compared to $85,029 or 2.1% of net revenues in 2009. The decrease is the result of the property rights related to Wizards of the Coast becoming fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2009. Amortization expense increased to $85,029 or 2.1% of    

 29   
 net revenues in 2009 compared to $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues in 2008. The increase was primarily a result of accelerated amortization related to a write-down of the carrying value of certain property rights as well as the purchase of the intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT in the second quarter of 2008. Property rights of $80,800 were recorded as a result of the purchase of TRIVIAL PURSUIT and are being amortized over fifteen years.  

 Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased in dollars but remained flat as a percentage of revenues in 2010. These expenses were $781,192 or 19.5% of revenues compared to $793,558 or 19.5% of revenues in 2009. The 2009 amount includes approximately $7,200 of transaction costs related to the Companys purchase of a 50% interest in THE HUB television network. The remaining decrease relates to management incentive and other compensation expenses in 2010 partially offset by higher marketing and sales costs related to emerging markets and our television initiatives. Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to $793,558 or 19.5% of net revenues in 2009, compared to $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in 2009. Included in selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2009 were approximately $7,200 in transaction costs discussed above. The increase in selling, distribution and administration expense in 2009 also reflected higher incentive compensation expense as well as costs related to the start up of the Companys television studio and continued investments in emerging markets. Selling, distribution and administration expense was also positively impacted by lower shipping and distribution costs in 2009. In addition, selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2008 were positively impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom of approximately $6,000.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense increased to $82,112 in 2010 from $61,603 in 2009. The 2009 interest expense amount includes approximately $4,000 in costs related to a short-term borrowing facility commitment the Company entered into in April 2009 in connection with the Companys anticipated investment in the joint venture with Discovery. Absent this charge, the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings and, to a lesser extent, higher average borrowing rates. The higher average borrowings reflect the issuance of $425,000 in principal amount of Notes in May 2009 and $500,000 in principal amount of Notes in March 2010, partially offset by the conversion and redemption of the 2.75% contingent convertible debentures during March and April of 2010. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2009 were primarily used to purchase a 50% interest in THE HUB. The increase in average borrowing rates in 2010 is due to the issuance of Notes in March 2010, which bear interest at the rate of 6.35%, partially offset by the conversion and redemption of the contingent convertible debentures during March and April 2010, which bore interest at 2.75%. Interest expense increased to $61,603 in 2009 from $47,143 in 2008. The increase in interest expense reflects both higher outstanding borrowings and a higher average borrowing rate as a result of the issuance of $425,000 of notes in May 2009. As noted above, interest expense in 2009 also includes approximately $4,000 in costs related to a short-term borrowing facility commitment the Company entered into in April 2009 in connection with the Companys anticipated investment in the joint venture with Discovery. In addition, interest expense in 2010 and 2009 include amounts related to the Companys tax sharing agreement with Discovery.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income was $5,649 in 2010 compared to $2,858 in 2009. The increase primarily reflects higher invested cash balances in 2010. Interest income was $2,858 in 2009 compared to $17,654 in 2008. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower returns on invested cash as well as lower average invested cash balances.  

 Other (Income) Expense, Net  

 Other (income) expense, net of $3,676 in 2010 compares to $156 in 2009. Other (income) expense, net in 2010 and 2009 includes $9,323 and $(3,856), respectively, relating to the Companys 50% share in the (earnings) loss of THE HUB. The 2010 amount also includes a gain of $4,950 on the sale of a product line.   

 30   
 Other (income) expense, net of $156 in 2009 compared to $23,752 in 2008. Other (income) expense, net in 2009 included income of $(3,856) representing the Companys 50% share in the earnings of THE HUB. The remainder of the change in other (income) expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflected the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses.  

 Income Taxes  

 Income tax expense totaled 21.7% of pretax earnings in 2010 compared with 29.2% in 2009 and 30.4% in 2008. Income tax expense for 2010 is net of a benefit of approximately $22,300 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Income tax expense for 2009 is net of a benefit of approximately $2,300 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the expiration of state statutes and settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2008 is net of a benefit of approximately $10,200 related to discrete tax events, primarily comprised of a benefit from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings, as well as the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Absent these items and potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in 2010, 2009 and 2008, the effective tax rates would have been 25.4%, 29.0% and 32.8%, respectively. The decrease in the adjusted tax rate from 29.0% in 2009 compared to 25.4% in 2010 is primarily due to a change in the mix of where the company earned its profits, due to lower earnings in the U.S. and increased earnings in international jurisdictions in which the tax rates are lower. The adjusted tax rate of 32.8% in 2008 primarily reflects the decision to provide for the repatriation of a portion of 2008 international earnings to the U.S.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2010, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit. In addition, in January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of banks to establish a commercial paper program. Under the program, at the Companys request and subject to market conditions, the group of banks may either purchase or arrange for the sale by the Company of unsecured commercial paper notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $500,000. During 2011, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its new revolving credit agreement. In the event that the Company is not able to issue commercial paper, the Company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2011, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us.  

 At December 26, 2010, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $713,228 compared to $621,932 and $622,804 at December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008, respectively. Hasbro generated $367,981, $265,623 and $593,185 of cash from its operating activities in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash from operations in 2010 and 2009 includes long-term royalty advance payments of $25,000 and $75,000, respectively. There were no long-term advance royalty payments made in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2009 were also negatively impacted by the Companys decision to sell $250,000 of its accounts receivable under its securitization program at December 28, 2008. The securitization program was not utilized at December 26, 2010 or December 27, 2009. The Company did not renew its accounts receivable securitization facility when that facility came up for renewal in January 2011.   

 31   
 Accounts receivable decreased to $961,252 at December 26, 2010 from $1,038,802 at December 27, 2009. The accounts receivable balance at December 26, 2010 includes a decrease of approximately $11,500 as a result of the translation of foreign currency balances due to the stronger U.S. dollar at December 26, 2010 compared to December 27, 2009. Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the decrease in accounts receivable reflects decreased sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. There was no utilization of the Companys securitization program at December 26, 2010 or December 27, 2009. Accounts receivable increased to $1,038,802 at December 27, 2009 from $611,766 at December 28, 2008. The accounts receivable balance at December 27, 2009 includes an increase of approximately $33,200 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar at December 27, 2009 as compared to December 28, 2008. Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the utilization of the Companys securitization program at December 28, 2008 of $250,000. The increase in accounts receivable also reflects higher sales, and the timing of those sales, in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to 2008. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding were 68 days in 2010 and 2009 and 45 days in 2008. Absent the impact of securitization, days sales outstanding would have been 63 days in 2008.  

 Inventories increased to $364,194 at December 26, 2010 compared to $207,895 at December 27, 2009. The increased inventory balance at December 26, 2010 reflects the lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. Inventories decreased to $207,895 at December 27, 2009 compared to $300,463 at December 28, 2008. The decrease primarily reflects higher inventory levels at December 28, 2008 due to decreased sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

 Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased slightly to $167,807 at December 26, 2010 from $162,290 at December 27, 2009. Increases in income tax receivables, current deferred income taxes and the values of the Companys forward currency contracts were partially offset by decreased prepaid royalties as the result of utilization of advance royalty payments. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made. Each reporting period, the Company reflects as current prepaid expense the amount of royalties it expects to reflect in the statement of operations in the upcoming twelve months. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $162,290 at December 27, 2009 from $171,387 at December 28, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the value of the Companys foreign currency contracts as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $18,000 in 2009, which are reflected as an investing activity in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows.  

 Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $704,233 at December 26, 2010 compared to $801,775 at December 27, 2009. This decrease primarily related to lower accrued payroll and management incentives, lower accrued royalties as a result of the decrease in entertainment-driven products, and lower accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments in the current year. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $801,775 at December 27, 2009 from $792,306 at December 28, 2008. The accounts payable and accrued expenses balance at December 27, 2009 includes an increase of approximately $17,700 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar at December 27, 2009 as compared to December 28, 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately $8,300. Decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2009 primarily relate to decreased accrued pension benefits, as well as lower accounts payable. These decreases were partially offset by higher accrued payroll and management incentives at December 27, 2009.  

 Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $104,188, $497,509, and $271,920 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 utilization includes the Companys $300,000 payment to Discovery for its 50% interest in THE HUB, a payment of $45,000 to Lucas to extend the term of the license agreement related to the STAR WARS brand and approximately $26,500 used to acquire certain other intellectual properties. The 2008 utilization includes the Companys purchase of the intellectual property rights related to the TRIVIAL PURSUIT brand for a total cost of $80,800 as well as $65,153 in cash, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Cranium in January 2008. There were no investments or acquisitions in 2010. During 2010, the Company expended approximately $113,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment compared to $104,000 during 2009 and $117,000 during 2008. Of these amounts, 57% in 2010, 58% in 2009 and 56% in    

 32   
 2008 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2011, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $125,000 to $135,000. During the three years ended December 26, 2010, depreciation of plant and equipment was $95,925, $95,934 and $87,873, respectively.  

 The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization program to fund its operations.  

 During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company was party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sold, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF was consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allowed HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it held to certain bank conduits. The program provided the Company with a source of working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 26, 2010, the Company had availability under this program to sell $250,000, of which no amounts were utilized. In January 2011, the Company terminated this facility.  

 On December 16, 2010, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides it with a $500,000 committed borrowing facility through December of 2014. The Agreement replaced the Companys previous revolving credit agreement. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Agreement, as well as the covenants in the prior revolving credit agreement for that portion of 2010 that it was effective, as of and for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2010. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 26, 2010. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of December 26, 2010 were approximately $1,400. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 26, 2010 were approximately $498,600. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $77,700 was utilized at December 26, 2010. Of the amount utilized under the uncommitted lines, approximately $14,400 and $63,300 represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.  

 In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of banks to establish a commercial paper program (the Program). Under the Program, at the request of the Company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the Company, or arrange for the sale by the Company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. Under the Program, the Company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $500,000. The maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and will be issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and will bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $170,595 in 2010. Of this amount, $639,563 reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2010, the Company repurchased 15,763 shares at an average price of $40.37. At December 26, 2010, $150,068 remained under the April 2010 authorization. Dividends paid were $133,048 in 2010 compared to $111,458 in 2009 reflecting the increase in the Companys dividend rate in 2010 to $0.25 per quarter from $0.20 per quarter. These utilizations    

 33   
 were partially offset by proceeds of $492,528 from the issuance of long-term notes in March 2010. In addition, cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2010 was $93,522.  

 Net cash provided by financing activities was $236,779 in 2009. Of this amount, $421,309 reflected net proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes in May 2009. In addition, cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2009 was $9,193. These sources of cash were partially offset by $88,112, which included transaction costs, used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2009, the Company repurchased 3,172 shares at an average price per share of $28.67. Dividends paid were $111,458 in 2009 compared to $107,065 in 2008.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $457,391 in 2008. Of this amount, $360,244, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2008, the Company repurchased 11,736 shares at an average price per share of $30.44. Dividends paid were $107,065 in 2008. In addition, $135,092 was used to repay long-term debt. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of $120,895 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 At December 27, 2009, the Company had outstanding $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. If the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeded $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures were convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. At December 31, 2009, this conversion feature was met and the debentures were convertible during the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2010, holders of these debentures converted $111,177, in principal amount, of these debentures which resulted in the issuance of 5,147 shares. In addition, if the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeded $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day period, the Company had the right to call the debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed notice period following such a call by the Company, the holders of the debentures had the right to convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms described above. As of March 28, 2010, the Company had the right to call the debentures. On March 29, 2010, as part of the Companys overall debt management strategy and in furtherance of its capital structure goals, the Company gave notice of its election to redeem in cash all of the outstanding debentures on April 29, 2010 at a redemption price of $1,011.31 per $1,000 principal amount, which was equal to the par value thereof plus accrued and unpaid cash interest through April 29, 2010. During the notice period, $138,467, in principal amount, of the debentures were converted by the holders, resulting in the issuance of 6,410 shares of common stock. The remaining debentures were redeemed at a total cost of $186, which included accrued interest through the redemption date.  

 The $350,000 notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+, respectively, or below. At December 26, 2010, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.  

 The $425,000 notes due in 2014 bear interest at a rate of 6.125%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+, respectively, or below. At December 26, 2010, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB, and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.   

 34   
 Including the debentures and notes described above, the Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 26, 2010 of approximately $1,384,895 due at varying times from 2014 through 2040. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately $179,592 and purchase commitments of $340,007 outstanding at December 26, 2010. Letters of credit and similar instruments include $114,890 related to the defense of tax assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $39,513 in 2011.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates  

 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.  

 Sales Allowances  

 Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to license fees and royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.  

 For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2010, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates made in prior years.  

 Program Production Costs  

 The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the Companys toy and game brands, including animated and live-action programs and game shows. These costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.  

 The most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. Ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations. Ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are    

 35   
 estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy, game and other merchandise licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as DVD distribution. Our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. We review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. Prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. Factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the U.S. which are distributed on THE HUB, our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.  

 For the year ended December 26, 2010 we have $35,415 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Program production cost amortization of $22,069 is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 26, 2010. We currently expect that over 90% of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over a 4 year period including the year of the programs initial broadcast distribution. The Company estimates program production cost amortization in 2011 to be in the range of $35,000 to $45,000, which includes amortization related to amounts capitalized during 2010 as well as amortization of amounts expected to be incurred for programs to be completed and released in 2011. Future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues. During 2010 the Company did not incur any impairment charges related to its program production costs.  

 Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

 The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value. No reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test. Accordingly, no impairment was indicated. The Companys annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and no impairments were indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 26, 2010, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $550,551 recorded on the balance sheet.  

 Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by    

 36   
 the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $424,859 at December 26, 2010. During 2010, the Company wrote down certain intangible assets by approximately $3,900 to reflect revised expectations of future cash flows for the related product lines.  

 Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

 The Companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 26, 2010, the Company had $112,922 of prepaid royalties, $17,922 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $95,000 of which are included in other assets.  

 Pension Costs and Obligations  

 Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. The estimates for the Companys U.S. plans are established at the Companys measurement date. The Company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.  

 The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets used in the calculation of 2010 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 8.0%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2010 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $610.  

 Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Companys discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2010 pension expense averaged 5.73%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2010 pension expense and the 2010 projected benefit obligation by approximately $383 and $9,815, respectively.  

 Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 26, 2010, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $87,553 included in accumulated other    

 37   
 comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $80,201 at December 27, 2009. The increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2010, primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to value the liability at December 26, 2010. The discount rate decreased to 5.20% at December 26, 2010 from 5.73% used at December 27, 2009. Pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.  

 Income Taxes  

 The Companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

 An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the Companys quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2010 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2010, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately $22,300 related to discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of a U.S. tax examination.  

 In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Companys income tax return. In 2007, the Mexican government instituted a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based tax in 2011, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.

 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

 In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,384,895 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 26, 2010. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 26, 2010 are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company has a liability at December 26, 2010, including potential interest and penalties, of $105,575 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.  

 In connection with the Companys agreement to form a joint venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.  

 The Companys agreement with Marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. The future minimum contractual payments in the table above include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of approximately $19,000 payable to Marvel that are contingent upon the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 4 which the Company currently expects to be paid in 2012 and may be reduced by payments occurring prior to the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 4. In addition, in connection with the extension of the Marvel license in 2009, the Company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling $140,000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next five to six years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases.  

 In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $5,400 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International pension plans in 2011. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $179,592 at December 26, 2010.  

 The Company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations described above.  

 Financial Risk Management  

 The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.   

 39   
 To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $68,455 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions.  

 The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.  

 The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 26, 2010, these contracts had unrealized gains of $16,151, of which $14,681 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $1,470 are recorded in other assets. Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December 26, 2010 are deferred gains of $15,432, net of tax, related to these derivatives.  

 At December 26, 2010, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $1,384,895. The Company is party to several interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $400,000, to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long-term debt. At December 26, 2010, the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $12,786, which is included in other assets, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase long-term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately $122,000 or $104,800, respectively. A hypothetical one-quarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2011 pretax earnings by $882 and 2011 cash flows by $764.  

 The Economy and Inflation   

 The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 50% of its consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 54% and 52% of its consolidated net revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

 The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2010, approximately 65% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration may be less in years where the Company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year. In 2010, the Company had products related to the mid-year major motion picture release of IRON MAN 2, while in 2009 the Company had products related to the mid-year major motion picture releases of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the    

 40   
 Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas.  

 Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys future revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.  

 The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2010 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

 Other Information  

 The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
