Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  

 Overview  

 The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable program services, television content production and distribution, motion pictures, consumer publishing, television and radio stations, interactive media, and outdoor advertising. The Company's principal strategy is to create and acquire content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company also continues to pursue opportunities to grow its revenue streams, including licensing its content for exhibition on digital and other platforms; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and increasingly monetizing content viewership and ratings as industry measurements evolve to reflect changing viewership habits. The Company's continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide it with incremental advertising and non-advertising revenues and serves to de-risk and diversify the Company's business model.  

 For 2013, the Company reported its highest results across all key financial metrics, including revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations, since becoming a separate publicly traded company in January 2006. Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.00 increased $.52, or 21%, from $2.48 for the same prior-year period, principally reflecting 8% higher revenues, 9% higher operating income and lower weighted average shares outstanding due to the Company's ongoing share repurchases. The revenue growth reflects increases across all of the Company's revenue streams. Advertising revenues increased 4%, principally driven by growth at the CBS Television Network, including the benefit from the 2013 broadcast of  Super Bowl XLVII. This growth was partially offset by a decline at Local Broadcasting resulting from lower political advertising sales. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 15%, led by growth from domestic and international licensing of television and cable programming for digital streaming and syndication. Affiliate and subscription fee revenues increased 16%, reflecting growth from cable affiliate fees, retransmission revenues, fees received from the CBS Television Network's affiliated television stations, as well as the benefit of Showtime Networks' distribution of two Floyd Mayweather pay-per-view boxing events. Operating income growth was driven by the increase in revenues which was partially offset by higher sports programming costs and increased investment in television content.  

 For 2014, the Company expects to benefit from continued growth in revenues received from MVPDs and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network as well as incremental political advertising sales associated with mid-term elections. Advertising revenue comparisons in 2014 will be negatively impacted by the Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network in the first quarter of 2013 as well as the broadcast of fewer NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship ("NCAA Tournament") games on the CBS Television Network in 2014. The Company's overall financial performance will be impacted by many other factors, including, the health of the economy and audience acceptance of the Company's programming.  

 During 2013, the Company returned $2.50 billion to shareholders through repurchases of its stock and payment of dividends. The Company repurchased 45.8 million shares of its Class B Common stock during 2013 at an average price of $48.03 per share. For 2014, the Company expects to continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $2.04 billion in 2013 and $1.82 billion in 2012. Included in operating cash flows are contributions of $150 million in 2013 and $200 million in 2012 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans. Free cash flow for 2013 of $1.77 billion increased $209 million compared to $1.57 billion for 2012. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information" on pages II-12 and II-13 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), to free cash flow.  

 During 2013, the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe for $225 million and announced its intention to separate its Outdoor Americas business and, subject to receiving an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") ruling, convert this business into a real estate investment trust ("REIT") ("Outdoor Americas Initiatives"). Subject to market conditions and customary approvals, CBS Outdoor Americas Inc., a subsidiary of the Company which holds the Outdoor Americas business ("CBS Outdoor Americas Inc."), expects to sell up to 20% of its common stock through an initial public offering ("IPO") during the first quarter of 2014. At a time subsequent to the IPO, the Company intends to dispose of the remaining shares of CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. that it will own after the completion of the IPO.  

 During January 2014, in connection with the Outdoor Americas Initiatives, Outdoor Americas borrowed $1.60 billion through an $800 million senior secured term loan credit facility ("Term Loan") and the issuance of $800 million of senior notes. The debt proceeds will primarily be used by the Company to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock through a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") transaction, with $50 million retained by Outdoor Americas for its corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs.  

CBS Corp. operates in the following five segments:  

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group, CBS Films and  CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 57% to consolidated revenues in 2013 and 55% to consolidated revenues in each of 2012 and 2011, and 49%, 46% and 47% to consolidated operating income in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 14%, 13% and 12% to consolidated revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 27% to consolidated operating income in 2013 and 26% to consolidated operating income in each of 2012 and 2011.  

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as  Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Free Press. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 5% to consolidated revenues in 2013 and 6% to consolidated revenues in each of 2012 and 2011, and 3% to consolidated operating income in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales. The Local Broadcasting segment contributed 18% to consolidated revenues in 2013 and 20% to consolidated revenues in each of 2012 and 2011, and 25%, 28% and 29% to consolidated operating income in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

OUTDOOR AMERICAS: The Outdoor Americas segment generates revenues primarily from providing advertising space on various structures in the United States, Canada and Latin America, including billboards, transit shelters and benches, buses, rail systems (both in-car and structures on station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage, and in retail stores. The Outdoor Americas segment contributed 9% to consolidated revenues in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011, and 7% to consolidated operating income in each of 2013 and 2012, and 8% to consolidated operating income in 2011.

 Revenues  

 The following tables present the Company's consolidated revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Advertising sales increased 4% to $8.80 billion in 2013 from $8.46 billion in 2012. This growth was principally driven by a 10% increase at the CBS Television Network, reflecting higher revenues from sports, including the 2013 broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network once every three years, as well as increases in primetime. Advertising revenue growth also reflects an 18% increase at CBS Interactive. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Local Broadcasting advertising of 4%, reflecting lower political advertising revenues.  

 In 2012, advertising sales increased 1% to $8.46 billion from $8.40 billion in 2011 reflecting growth at Local Broadcasting resulting from increased political advertising spending associated with the U.S. presidential election. Network advertising revenues increased slightly reflecting higher pricing, partially offset by lower ratings during the second half of 2012.  

 In 2014, local advertising revenues are expected to benefit from increased political advertising spending for midterm elections. For national advertising, revenues in 2014 will benefit from upfront pricing increases for the 2013/2014 television broadcast season. (See pages I-2 and I-3 for a description of advertising sales in the upfront and scatter markets). In addition, 2014 advertising revenue comparisons will be negatively impacted by the broadcast of the Super Bowl on the CBS Television Network in the first

quarter of 2013 as well as the broadcast of fewer NCAA Tournament games on the CBS Television Network in 2014. In 2014, two regional final games and the national semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, which were previously broadcast by CBS, will be broadcast by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. ("Turner"). Overall advertising revenues will also be impacted by ratings for the Company's programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market.  

 Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced television programming to multiple media platforms and in various geographic locations; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For 2013, content licensing and distribution revenues increased 15% to $4.00 billion from $3.47 billion in 2012 and for 2012, content licensing and distribution revenues increased 7% from $3.24 billion in 2011. These increases reflected growth from domestic and international licensing of programming for syndication and digital streaming. For 2013, revenue contributions from significant domestic syndication availabilities included the first-cycle sales of NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife. (See page I-3 for more information about television syndication cycles).  

 During 2014, content licensing and distribution revenues are expected to benefit from the first-cycle domestic syndication availabilities of Hawaii Five-0 and Blue Bloods; however, revenue comparisons to 2013 may be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of television series for multiple year licensing agreements, as television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available for exhibition.  

 Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs for carriage of the Company's cable networks, as well as for authorizing the MVPDs' carriage of the Company's owned television stations ("retransmission fees"); fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (known as "network affiliation fees" or "reverse compensation"); and subscriber fees for online content. For 2013, affiliate and subscription fees increased 16% to $2.22 billion from $1.92 billion in 2012 and for 2012, affiliate and subscription fees increased 9% from $1.76 billion in 2011. These increases reflected growth in retransmission revenues and network affiliation fees of 39% for 2013 and 42% for 2012; as well as increases in Cable Networks affiliate fees. The increase in Cable Networks affiliate fees reflected growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. For 2013, the increase was also driven by revenues from Showtime Networks' distribution of two Floyd Mayweather pay-per-view boxing events. The Company expects continued growth in retransmission revenues, network affiliation fees and cable affiliate fees in 2014, however, quarterly comparisons will fluctuate based on the timing of pay-per-view boxing events.  

 Other revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor Americas operations, increased 9% to $263 million in 2013 from $241 million in 2012, principally reflecting higher ancillary digital revenues. For 2012, other revenues of $241 million remained relatively flat compared to $240 million in 2011.

 International Revenues  

 International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues, as well as outdoor advertising revenues generated in Canada, Mexico and South America. The Company generated approximately 13% of its total revenues from international regions in 2013 and 12% in each of 2012 and 2011.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Expenses  

 The table below presents the Company's consolidated operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Programming expenses represented 35% of total operating expenses for 2013 and 33% for each of the years 2012 and 2011, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses increased 16% to $3.05 billion in 2013 from $2.62 billion in 2012 primarily reflecting higher sports programming costs associated with the CBS Television Network's 2013 broadcast of the Super Bowl and Showtime Networks' distribution of two pay-per-view boxing events, as well as higher investment in acquired television programming. For 2012, programming expenses increased 2% to $2.62 billion from $2.56 billion in 2011 primarily driven by higher investment in acquired television programming.  

 Sports programming expenses in the first quarter of 2014 are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter of 2013 which included costs associated with the Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network. In addition, during the first half of 2014, sports programming costs will be lower due to the broadcast of fewer NCAA Tournament games on CBS. For the full year 2014, these decreases will be partially offset by cost increases beginning in the third quarter of 2014 associated with the Company's new agreement with the National Football League ("NFL") as well as the addition of a Thursday night NFL game on CBS for eight weeks.  

II-8 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Production expenses represented 28% of total operating expenses for 2013 and 27% for each of the years 2012 and 2011, and reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses increased 16% to $2.49 billion in 2013 from $2.15 billion in 2012 primarily driven by increased revenues from the first-cycle domestic availabilities of NCIS: Los Angeles and  The Good Wife, as well as higher investment in internally developed television programming. For 2012, production expenses increased 3% to $2.15 billion from $2.10 billion in 2011 primarily driven by higher amortization associated with increased revenues from television licensing arrangements.  

 Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses represented 7% of total operating expenses for 2013 and 8% for each of the years 2012 and 2011, and reflect lease and franchise costs associated with billboards, transit and other outdoor advertising displays; rent expense on production facilities; and other occupancy costs. For 2013, billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses decreased 1% to $643 million from $648 million in 2012, principally due to lower transit costs associated with the renewal of a transit contract at more favorable terms and the impact from a billboard tax imposed on the outdoor advertising industry in Toronto, which included a one-time retroactive payment in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by higher contingent rent expenses associated with the increase in outdoor advertising revenues. For 2012, billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 2% to $648 million from $637 million in 2011, principally due to the aforementioned impact of the Toronto billboard tax, partially offset by lower occupancy expenses from the impact of cost-savings initiatives.  

 Participation, distribution and royalty costs, which represented 13% of total operating expenses in each of the years 2013 and 2012, and 14% in 2011, primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television and feature film content, such as print and advertising. Participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 11% to $1.11 billion in 2013 from $1.00 billion in 2012, principally due to higher participations associated with higher revenues from the licensing of television programming. For 2012, participation, distribution and royalty costs decreased 6% to $1.00 billion from $1.07 billion in 2011, principally due to lower participations associated with the mix of titles licensed for syndication.  

 Other operating expenses, which represented 17% of total operating expenses in 2013 and 19% for each of the years 2012 and 2011, primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For 2013, other operating expenses decreased 2% to $1.52 billion from $1.55 billion in 2012. For 2012, other operating expenses increased 2% to $1.55 billion from $1.52 billion in 2011 reflecting higher employee-related costs mainly to support growth in digital businesses.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 18% of revenues for 2013, and 19% for each of the years 2012 and 2011. For 2013, SG&A expenses increased $101 million, or 4%, to $2.74 billion from $2.63 billion in 2012 reflecting higher employee-related costs, mainly associated with $76 million higher stock-based compensation primarily from the increase in the Company's stock price; increased selling expenses associated with higher revenues; and professional fees related to the Company's Outdoor Americas Initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a 2012 charge related to a Publishing legal settlement and a gain from the sale of outdoor advertising assets.  

II-9 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 For 2012, SG&A expenses increased $36 million, or 1%, to $2.63 billion from $2.60 billion in 2011 principally due to a charge related to a Publishing legal settlement, and higher advertising and promotion expenses.  

 Restructuring Charges  

 During the year ended December 31, 2013, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization or closure of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $20 million, reflecting $14 million of severance costs and $6 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $19 million and $43 million, respectively. The charges reflected $22 million of severance costs and $40 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2013, the cumulative amount paid for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 restructuring charges was $57 million, of which $23 million was for the severance costs and $34 million related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. The 2012 and 2011 restructuring reserves were substantially utilized at December 31, 2013. The Company expects to substantially utilize the 2013 restructuring reserve by the end of 2014.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impairment Charges  

 In 2012, in connection with the sale of its five owned radio stations in West Palm Beach, the Company recorded a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $11 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization decreased $18 million, or 4%, to $457 million for 2013 from $475 million for 2012, principally reflecting lower depreciation associated with declining capital expenditure levels in recent years and lower amortization resulting from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. For 2012, depreciation and amortization decreased $20 million, or 4%, to $475 million from $495 million for 2011, primarily reflecting lower amortization for leasehold agreements.

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense decreased $26 million, or 6%, to $376 million for 2013 from $402 million for 2012 and for 2012, interest expense decreased $33 million, or 8% from $435 million for 2011, in both cases driven by the Company's debt refinancing during 2012. The Company had $5.96 billion of long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 and $5.92 billion at December 31, 2012, each at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%. At December 31, 2013, the Company also had $475 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.3%.  

 In January 2014, in connection with the Outdoor Americas Initiatives, Outdoor Americas borrowed $1.60 billion through an $800 million variable-rate Term Loan and the issuance of $800 million of fixed-rate senior notes. The debt is expected to result in annualized interest expense of approximately $72 million (based on the initial interest rate on the Term Loan of 3%).  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income increased $2 million to $8 million for 2013 from $6 million for 2012. For 2012, interest income was flat at $6 million compared to 2011.  

 Net Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

 For 2012, the net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $32 million reflected a pre-tax loss associated with the redemption of the Company's $338 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2012 and $400 million of 8.20% senior notes due 2014, partially offset by the pre-tax gain recognized upon the redemption of the Company's $700 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2056 (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 Other Items, Net  

 For all periods presented, "Other items, net" primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains and losses.  

 Provision for Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2013, the provision for income taxes increased to $978 million from $892 million in 2012 and for 2012, the provision for income taxes increased from $751 million in 2011. These increases were mainly driven by the increase in earnings from continuing operations. The Company's effective income tax rate was 34% in 2013, 35% in 2012 and 34% in 2011. For 2014, the Company's annual effective tax rate is expected to be comparable to the prior three years.  

 Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  

 Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $46 million for 2013, $35 million for 2012 and $37 million for 2011 reflecting the Company's share of the operating results of its equity investments.  

 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations  

 The Company reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.87 billion for 2013, $1.63 billion for 2012 and $1.39 billion for 2011.

 Net Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations  

 On September 30, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe for $225 million. Outdoor Europe has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Included in the loss from discontinued operations of $147 million for 2013 is an after-tax charge of $110 million associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement and the estimated fair value of guarantees, which historically have been intercompany but upon the closing of the transaction became third-party guarantees (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 The following table sets forth details of the net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Net Earnings and Diluted EPS  

 For 2013, net earnings were $1.88 billion, or $3.01 per diluted share, up from $1.57 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share in 2012, and for 2012, net earnings increased from $1.31 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share in 2011. These increases were mainly driven by the growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense. The increase in diluted EPS also reflected lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company's ongoing share repurchase program.  

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  

 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and less capital expenditures. The Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations. The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

 Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several  

II-12 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry.  

 As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.  

 The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Segment Results of OperationsÂ—For the Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011  

 The following tables present the Company's revenues; operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA"), restructuring charges and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA"); operating income (loss); and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The Company presents Segment OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA to the Company's consolidated Net earnings (loss) is presented in Note 15 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

 2013 vs. 2012  

 For 2013, Entertainment revenues increased 12% to $8.65 billion from $7.69 billion in 2012 reflecting higher advertising revenues, content licensing and distribution revenues and network affiliation fees. Advertising revenues increased 10%, driven by growth at the CBS Television Network of 10%, reflecting higher revenues from sports, including the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVII on the CBS Television Network in 2013, as well as an increase in primetime. Also contributing to the advertising revenue growth is an increase at CBS Interactive of 18%. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 15%, reflecting growth from domestic and international licensing of television programming for digital streaming and syndication, led by the first-cycle domestic availabilities of NCIS: Los Angeles and  The Good Wife.  

 For 2013, Entertainment OIBDA increased $209 million, or 13%, to $1.76 billion from $1.55 billion for 2012, principally driven by the growth in revenues which was partially offset by an increased investment in television content and higher sports programming costs associated with the Super Bowl broadcast. For 2013, restructuring charges of $12 million principally reflected costs associated with exiting certain international operations and severance costs. Restructuring charges of $7 million in 2012 principally reflected severance costs.  

 Comparability in 2014 will be negatively impacted by the Super Bowl broadcast on CBS in the first quarter of 2013 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2014, cost increases associated with the Company's new agreement with the NFL as well as the addition of a Thursday night NFL game on CBS for eight weeks. Results in 2014 are expected to benefit from incremental network affiliation fees associated with current agreements and expected renewals in 2014. Also in 2014, the Company expects to benefit from the first-cycle domestic availabilities of Hawaii Five-0 and Blue Bloods, however, revenue comparisons may be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of television series for multiple year licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements were $3.14 billion and $2.42 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2013, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.52 billion in 2014, $848 million in 2015, $400 million in 2016, $207 million in 2017, and $168 million in 2018 and thereafter. Unrecognized revenues attributable to license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $1.14 billion and $1.31 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Entertainment revenues increased 3% to $7.69 billion from $7.46 billion in 2011. This growth was led by a 13% increase in revenues from the licensing of television programming, driven by higher licensing revenues from digital streaming as well as domestic and international syndication. Revenue growth also reflects higher network affiliation fees. Advertising revenues increased slightly, reflecting higher pricing partially offset by lower primetime ratings during the second half of 2012.  

 For 2012, Entertainment OIBDA increased $118 million, or 8%, to $1.55 billion from $1.43 billion for 2011, principally driven by the aforementioned revenue growth and higher profit margins on television licensing revenues. For 2011, restructuring charges of $40 million principally reflected costs associated with exiting operating facilities and severance costs.

 Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks)  

 (Contributed 14%, 13% and 12% to consolidated revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 27% to consolidated operating income in 2013 and 26% to consolidated operating income in each of 2012 and 2011.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2013 vs. 2012  

 For 2013, Cable Networks revenues increased 17% to $2.07 billion from $1.77 billion in 2012 driven by higher domestic and international licensing revenues from the digital streaming and syndication of Showtime original series, led by  Dexter, revenues from the distribution of two Floyd Mayweather pay-per-view boxing events, and higher affiliate revenues. Affiliate revenues increased 5% reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. As of December 31, 2013 subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and  Flix), 51 million for CBS Sports Network and 21 million for Smithsonian Networks.  

 For 2013, Cable Networks OIBDA increased $87 million, or 11%, to $898 million from $811 million for 2012, principally due to the aforementioned revenue increases, partially offset by higher programming and production costs associated with the pay-per-view boxing events, the increase in licensing revenues and increased investment in  Showtime original series. Cable Networks OIBDA margin decreased to 43% in 2013 from 46% in 2012 due to the margin impact from the distribution of the above mentioned pay-per-view boxing events. Restructuring charges of $1 million in 2013 reflected severance costs.  

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Cable Networks revenues increased 9% to $1.77 billion from $1.62 billion in 2011 primarily driven by higher affiliate fees, which reflected increases in rates and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, as well as higher licensing revenues from the digital streaming and international syndication of Showtime original series. As of December 31, 2012 subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and  Flix), 46 million for CBS Sports Network and 17 million for Smithsonian Networks.  

 For 2012, Cable Networks OIBDA increased $104 million, or 15%, to $811 million from $707 million for 2011, primarily due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower costs for theatrical programming, partially offset by higher programming and production costs associated with Showtime original series and sports programming.

 Publishing (Simon & Schuster)  

 (Contributed 5% to consolidated revenues in 2013 and 6% to consolidated revenues in each of 2012 and 2011, and 3% to consolidated operating income in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2013 vs. 2012  

 For 2013, Publishing revenues increased 2% to $809 million from $790 million in 2012 led by growth in digital book sales. Digital book sales increased 22% from the same prior-year period and represented 27% of Publishing's total revenues for 2013 compared to 23% in 2012. Best-selling titles in 2013 included  Doctor Sleep by Stephen King and Happy, Happy, Happy by Phil Robertson.  

 For 2013, Publishing OIBDA increased $24 million, or 27%, to $113 million from $89 million for 2012. The increase was mainly driven by the revenue growth, a charge in 2012 related to a legal settlement and a decline in production and distribution costs associated with a higher mix of revenues from digital book sales, partially offset by higher advertising expenses. Restructuring charges of $1 million in 2013 primarily reflected severance costs and restructuring charges of $3 million in 2012 primarily reflected costs associated with combining several of Publishing's imprints.  

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Publishing revenues of $790 million remained relatively flat compared to $787 million in 2011, reflecting growth in digital book sales and lower print book sales. Revenues from digital sales increased 35% from the same prior-year period and represented 23% of total Publishing revenues in 2012 compared to 17% in 2011. Best-selling titles in 2012 included Kill Shot by Vince Flynn and The Wind Through the Keyhole by Stephen King.  

 For 2012, Publishing OIBDA decreased $3 million, or 3%, to $89 million from $92 million for 2011. The decrease was driven by a charge related to a settlement agreement to resolve the e-books antitrust action covering a number of states, the District of Columbia and United States territories. Underlying Publishing results in 2012 reflected margin growth associated with an increase in the mix of revenues from digital book sales, which have lower production and distribution costs than print books. Restructuring charges of $2 million in 2011 reflected severance costs.

 Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio)  

 (Contributed 18% to consolidated revenues in 2013 and 20% to consolidated revenues in each of 2012 and 2011, and 25%, 28% and 29% to consolidated operating income in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2013 vs. 2012  

 For 2013, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 3% to $2.70 billion from $2.77 billion for 2012. CBS Television Stations revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower political advertising and lower revenues from the nonrenewal of an unprofitable sports programming contract. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of the 2013 broadcast of Super Bowl XLVII to the Company's owned CBS affiliated stations and higher retransmission revenues. CBS Radio revenues decreased 1% principally reflecting the impact of radio station dispositions in 2012, partially offset by the benefit of the new CBS Sports Radio network. Results for 2014 are expected to benefit from increased political advertising spending for midterm elections.  

 Local Broadcasting OIBDA decreased $59 million, or 6%, to $898 million from $957 million for 2012, principally reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower television programming costs and the benefit from the nonrenewal of an unprofitable sports programming contract. During 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $11 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill in connection with the disposition of the Company's radio stations in West Palm Beach. Restructuring charges of $5 million in 2013 reflected severance costs. For 2012, restructuring charges of $8 million principally reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations.  

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Local Broadcasting revenues increased 3% to $2.77 billion from $2.69 billion for 2011 principally reflecting higher political advertising and retransmission revenues partially offset by softness in local economies. CBS Television Stations revenues increased 8% from the prior year, while CBS Radio revenues decreased 2%.  

 For 2012, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased $108 million, or 13%, to $957 million from $849 million for 2011, primarily driven by the revenue growth, lower programming costs for syndicated programming, and lower music royalty costs.

 Acquisitions and Dispositions  

 During 2012, the Company acquired a radio station in the New York market and a radio station in the Washington, D.C. area, as well as a television station in Long Island, New York. Also during 2012, the Company sold five radio stations in West Palm Beach. Together, these acquisitions and dispositions did not have a material impact on the comparability of operating results.  

 Outdoor Americas (CBS Outdoor) 

 (Contributed 9% to consolidated revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, and 7% to consolidated operating income in each of 2013 and 2012, and 8% to consolidated operating income in 2011.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2013 vs. 2012  

 For 2013, Outdoor Americas revenues increased 1% in both reported and constant dollars to $1.30 billion, driven by 3% revenue growth in the U.S., reflecting increased revenues in the billboard and transit businesses of 3% and 2%, respectively. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the nonrenewal of transit contracts in Canada, as well as a decline in Mexico. Approximately 13% and 14% of Outdoor Americas revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

 For 2013, Outdoor Americas OIBDA increased $33 million, or 9%, to $411 million from $378 million in 2012, primarily reflecting the revenue growth, gains from the disposition of outdoor assets in 2013, and the impact from a billboard tax imposed on the outdoor advertising industry in Toronto, which included a one-time retroactive payment in 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold 50% of its transit shelter operations in Los Angeles. The Company and the buyer each subsequently contributed their respective 50% interests in these operations to a 50/50 joint venture that the Company and buyer own together. This transaction resulted in a gain of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Outdoor Americas revenues increased 1% on both a reported and constant dollar basis to $1.30 billion from $1.29 billion in 2011, principally driven by 5% growth in the U.S. reflecting increases in both the billboard and transit businesses. The nonrenewal of the Toronto transit contract negatively affected the revenue comparison by two percentage points. Approximately 14% and 18% of Outdoor Americas revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

 For 2012, Outdoor Americas OIBDA decreased $2 million, or 1%, to $378 million from $380 million in 2011, as the revenue growth was offset by the negative outcome of a dispute over a billboard tax that was  

II-19 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

imposed on the outdoor advertising industry in Toronto, including a one-time retroactive payment. Outdoor Americas depreciation and amortization decreased $13 million to $169 million in 2012, principally reflecting lower amortization for leasehold agreements. Restructuring charges of $1 million in 2011 reflected severance costs.  

 Outdoor Americas Initiatives  

 During 2013, the Company announced its intention to separate its Outdoor Americas business and, subject to receiving an IRS ruling, convert this business into a REIT. Subject to market conditions and customary approvals, CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. expects to sell up to 20% of its common stock through an IPO during the first quarter of 2014. At a time subsequent to the IPO, the Company intends to dispose of the remaining shares of CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. that it will own after the completion of the IPO.  

 Corporate  

 Corporate expenses include general corporate overhead, unallocated shared company expenses, pension and postretirement benefit costs for plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses, and intercompany eliminations. For 2013, corporate expenses increased 15% to $367 million from $320 million for 2012 driven by higher stock-based compensation of $62 million, mainly associated with the increase in the Company's stock price, and professional fees related to the Outdoor Americas Initiatives. This increase was partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit costs, reflecting the benefit from pre-funding pension plans in 2012 and the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2012.  

 For 2012, corporate expenses decreased 2% to $320 million from $326 million for 2011 driven by lower pension and postretirement benefit costs, primarily due to the benefit from pre-funding pension plans in 2011 and lower pension-related interest cost associated with retirees. This decrease was partially offset by expense increases associated with the Company's higher stock price.  

 Financial Position  

 Current assets decreased by $350 million to $5.37 billion at December 31, 2013 from $5.72 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in current assets of discontinued operations reflecting the disposition of Outdoor Europe during 2013. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in receivables associated with television licensing agreements. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 2.2% at December 31, 2013 compared with 2.5% at December 31, 2012, primarily due to the increase in receivables relating to television licensing agreements, which generally have a higher rate of collectibility compared to the Company's other receivables.  

 Net property and equipment of $2.24 billion at December 31, 2013 decreased by $35 million from $2.27 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $357 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $270 million and capital lease additions for broadcasting equipment of $58 million.  

 Other assets increased by $459 million to $2.01 billion at December 31, 2013 from $1.55 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting higher long-term receivables associated with additional revenues from long-term television licensing agreements, and the acquisition of a 50% interest in TVGN (TV Guide Network) during the first quarter of 2013.  

II-20 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 As of December 31, 2013, total outstanding receivables from licensing arrangements, including both current and noncurrent, were $3.14 billion versus $2.42 billion at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.52 billion in 2014, $848 million in 2015, $400 million in 2016, $207 million in 2017, and $168 million in 2018 and thereafter.  

 Current liabilities increased by $266 million to $4.21 billion at December 31, 2013 from $3.94 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily driven by commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities of discontinued operations resulting from the disposition of Outdoor Europe.  

 Pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased by $530 million to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2013 from $1.86 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans and an increase in the discount rate partially offset by changes in other actuarial assumptions.  

 Other liabilities decreased $66 million to $2.09 billion at December 31, 2013 from $2.16 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily driven by lower programming liabilities and residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses.  

 Cash Flows  

 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $311 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and increased by $48 million and $180 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Activities. In 2013, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $225 million to $2.04 billion from $1.82 billion in 2012 primarily reflecting growth in operating income, the benefit from the 2013 Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network and lower payments for interest. Cash interest payments for 2012 included approximately $60 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for make-whole premiums. The increase from operating income was partially offset by an increase in receivables from the licensing of television programming, driven by the timing difference between revenue recognition and collections for long term television licensing arrangements. Revenues from the licensing of television programming are recognized when the television series is made available to the licensee, at the beginning of the applicable license period, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. During 2013, the Company made  

II-21 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

contributions of $150 million to pre-fund its qualified pension plans compared with contributions of $200 million in 2012.  

 Cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations of $171 million for 2013 includes payments associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement in connection with the sale of Outdoor Europe.  

 In 2012, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $13 million to $1.82 billion from $1.83 billion in 2011 as the increase in operating income was more than offset by higher income tax payments and a higher use of cash from working capital. The increased use of working capital primarily reflected a higher level of investment in television content in 2012, and higher receivables from the timing difference between revenue recognition and collections for long term television licensing arrangements, primarily for digital streaming. The Company made pension contributions to its qualified plans of $200 million in 2012 compared with $410 million in 2011.  

 Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations was $422 million for 2013, $425 million for 2012 and $233 million for 2011. The decrease in cash taxes for 2013 was mainly due to the receipt of federal tax refunds, offset by the increase in pre-tax income. The increase in cash taxes for 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by the increase in pre-tax income and lower tax benefits from lower contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans.  

 Investing Activities. In 2013, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $255 million principally reflects capital expenditures of $270 million and investments in investee companies of $176 million, mainly for the Company's new investment in TVGN (TV Guide Network) as well as its other domestic and international television joint ventures. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from dispositions of $193 million, principally from the sale of Outdoor Europe. In 2012, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $429 million principally includes capital expenditures of $254 million; acquisitions of $146 million, primarily for television and radio stations; and investments of $91 million, primarily in domestic and international television joint ventures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $49 million received for dispositions, principally from the sale of radio stations. In 2011, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $369 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $245 million; investments of $79 million, principally in domestic and international television joint ventures; and acquisitions of $75 million, primarily for internet businesses.  

 Capital expenditures for 2014 are anticipated to be at a similar level to 2013.  

 Financing Activities. In 2013, cash used for financing activities of $1.91 billion principally reflected the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $2.19 billion and dividend payments of $300 million, partially offset by proceeds from short-term borrowings of $475 million. For 2012, cash used for financing activities of $1.32 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.58 billion, the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.14 billion and dividend payments of $276 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.57 billion and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $168 million. For 2011, cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion principally reflected the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.01 billion and dividend payments of $206 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $72 million.  

 Dividends  

 On January 29, 2014, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.12 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2014. The Company declared a quarterly cash  

II-22

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2013, 2012 and 2011, resulting in total annual dividends of $295 million, $287 million and $237 million, respectively.  

 Share Repurchase Program  

 During 2013, the Company repurchased 45.8 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $2.20 billion, at an average cost of $48.03 per share. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in January 2011 through December 31, 2013, the Company has repurchased 123.5 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $4.39 billion, at an average cost of $35.54 per share, leaving $5.43 billion of authorization remaining at December 31, 2013.  

 During the first quarter of 2014, the Company expects to spend $2.0 billion to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock, of which $1.5 billion will be spent for an ASR transaction using proceeds from Outdoor Americas borrowings.  

 Capital Structure  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $13 million and $16 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $18 million and $23 million, respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $6.44 billion at December 31, 2013 and $5.93 billion at December 31, 2012. 

(b)Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

 At December 31, 2013, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Outdoor Americas Indebtedness  

 In January 2014, in connection with the Outdoor Americas Initiatives, Outdoor Americas borrowed $1.60 billion through an $800 million Term Loan and the issuance of $800 million of senior notes through a private placement. The senior notes are comprised of $400 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 and $400 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024. The Term Loan is due in 2021 and bears interest at a rate  

II-23 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

equal to 2.25% plus the greater of the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") or 0.75%. The debt is guaranteed by CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.  

 The Term Loan is part of a credit agreement which also includes a $425 million revolving credit facility (the "Outdoor Revolving Credit Facility") which expires in 2019. The Outdoor Revolving Credit Facility bears interest based on LIBOR plus a margin based on Outdoor Americas consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio. The Net Secured Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of Outdoor Americas secured debt (less up to $150 million of unrestricted cash) to Outdoor Americas consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). The Outdoor Revolving Credit Facility requires Outdoor Americas to maintain a maximum Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio of 3.50 to 1.00, which will be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 if Outdoor Americas elects to be taxed as a REIT. As of February 14, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Outdoor Revolving Credit Facility.  

 The debt proceeds will be primarily used by the Company to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock through a $1.5 billion ASR transaction with $50 million retained by Outdoor Americas for its corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs.  

 Commercial Paper  

 At December 31, 2013, the Company had $475 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding under its $2.0 billion commercial paper program. Outstanding commercial paper borrowings have a weighted average interest rate of 0.3% and maturities of less than thirty days.  

 Credit Facility  

 During 2013, the Company amended and restated its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") which now expires in March 2018. The amended facility provides for lower borrowing rates and fees, as well as more favorable covenants. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.  

 The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2013, the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 1.6x.  

 The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company's indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company's Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.  

 The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2013, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.99 billion.  

II-24 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company's operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, transit franchise payments, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company's investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $1.99 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2013, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.  

 The Company's funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs.  

 At December 31, 2013, the Company had $475 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which the Company expects to repay during the first quarter of 2014 using proceeds from its Outdoor Americas Initiatives and cash generated from operations. Funding for the Company's long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $999 million is expected to come from the Company's ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.  

 During the first quarter of 2014, the Company expects to spend $2.0 billion to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock, of which a $1.5 billion will be spent for an ASR transaction using proceeds from Outdoor Americas borrowings. (See "Capital Structure").

 Contractual Obligations  

 As of December 31, 2013 the Company's significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $11.23 billion for sports programming rights, $2.47 billion relating to the production and licensing of television, radio, and film programming, and $773 million for talent contracts. 

(b)Outdoor Americas has agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle it to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, mall and street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 

(c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. 

(d)Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. Total future minimum payments of $1.79 billion include $640 million for Outdoor Americas billboards. 

(e)Long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. 

(f)Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt and excluding capital leases. 

(g)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. 

(h)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.   

 The table above excludes $140 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation. The above table also excludes principal and interest payments related to the $1.60 billion of indebtedness incurred by Outdoor Americas in January 2014.  

 In 2014, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $50 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2014, the Company expects to contribute approximately $62 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company's portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

 Guarantees  

 On September 30, 2013 the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe to an affiliate of Platinum Equity. The Company continues to remain as guarantor of Outdoor Europe's franchise payment obligations under certain transit franchise agreements. Generally, the Company would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-performance by the buyer. These agreements have varying terms, with the majority of the obligations guaranteed under these agreements expiring by September 2016. At December 31, 2013, the total franchise payment obligations under these agreements are estimated to be approximately $280 million, which will decrease on a monthly basis thereafter. The estimated fair value of the guarantee liability of approximately $40 million is included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013.  

 The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2013, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $321 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.  

 The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 Programming and Production Costs  

 Accounting for television and theatrical film production costs requires management's judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned ("Ultimate Revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program or theatrical film, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs or theatrical films.  

II-27 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program.  

 Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program and theatrical film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.  

 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test.  

 GoodwillÂ—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. For 2013, in accordance with FASB guidance for goodwill impairment testing, the Company performed qualitative assessments for seven reporting units which management estimates each have fair values that exceed their respective carrying values by 20% or more. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units. Based on this qualitative assessment, considering the aggregation of these factors, the Company concluded that for these seven reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and therefore performing the two-step impairment test was unnecessary.  

 The Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the remaining two reporting units. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows ("Discounted Cash Flow Method") and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses ("Market Comparable Method"). For 2013, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures  

II-28 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

for the projection period are based on the Company's internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market or a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 Based on the 2013 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the fair value of each of the two reporting units for which the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test exceeded their respective carrying values. The carrying value of the following reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $1.86 billion at December 31, 2013, was within 10% of its fair value:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 An increase to the discount rate of 20 basis points or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rate of 20 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value of the CBS Radio reporting unit to fall below its respective carrying value.  

 FCC LicensesÂ—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company's radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use.  

 For its annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company performed qualitative assessments for eight radio markets and ten television markets which management estimates each have an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that exceed their respective carrying values by 20% or more. For each market, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on this qualitative assessment, considering the aggregation of these factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the aggregate fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these radio and television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.  

 For each of the remaining radio and television markets the Company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up station, the total market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry.  

 The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2013 were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The assumptions used in determining the fair values of the FCC licenses require management to make significant judgments. Certain events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital or a decline in the local radio or television advertising markets, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television and radio stations. Deterioration in the economic conditions or a change in population size of any individual geographic market could adversely impact advertisers' ability or willingness to purchase advertising on the radio and television stations in that market. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain industries, including automotive, entertainment and retail, have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues in all geographic markets. As a result, an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in these categories or adverse economic conditions, particularly in larger markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, where the Company holds FCC licenses with substantial carrying values, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the FCC licenses.  

 Based on the 2013 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses in each radio and television market for which the Company performed the quantitative assessment exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. Two radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $114 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and eight radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $1.20 billion, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. In each of the remaining radio markets and in all of the television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values by more than 10%. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Reserves and Legal Matters  

 Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.  

 Pensions  

 Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rates are determined based on the yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2013, the unrecognized actuarial losses decreased from the prior year end due primarily to an increase in the discount rate partially offset by changes in other actuarial assumptions. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $100 million and will not have a material impact on the 2014 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $10 million in 2014 pension expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized tax benefits of $17 million and $3 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing  

II-31 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $140 million at December 31, 2013 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.  

 Legal Matters  

 E-books Matters. A number of lawsuits described below have been pending against the following parties relating to the sale of e-books: Apple Inc., Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers, LLC, Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC d/b/a Macmillan, Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and the Company's subsidiary, Simon & Schuster, Inc. (collectively, the "Publishing parties").  

 On April 10, 2012, for purposes of settlement and without any admission of wrongdoing or liability, Simon & Schuster and two of the other Publishing parties entered into a settlement stipulation and proposed final judgment (the "Stipulation") with the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") in connection with the DOJ's investigations of agency distribution of e-books. In furtherance of this settlement, on April 11, 2012, the DOJ filed an antitrust action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Publishing parties and concurrently filed the Stipulation with the court. On September 7, 2012, the Stipulation was approved by the court and final judgment was entered. The Stipulation does not involve any monetary payments by Simon & Schuster, but will require the adoption of certain business practices for a 24 month period (the "24 Month Period") and certain compliance practices for a five year period. Following a ruling in favor of the DOJ and a judgment against Apple that was entered by the court on September 6, 2013, Apple filed an appeal, which will be heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On October 4, 2013, Simon & Schuster filed an appeal with the court relating to an aspect of the Apple judgment involving the 24 Month Period.  

 On June 11, 2012, for purposes of settlement and without any admission of wrongdoing or liability, Simon & Schuster entered into a proposed settlement agreement to resolve the antitrust action filed by a number of states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico against several of the Publishing parties in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, which was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ("States") on April 30, 2012. The proposed settlement provides that, certain Publishing parties, including Simon & Schuster, will pay agreed upon amounts for consumer restitution, among other things, and also requires the adoption of certain business and compliance practices, which are substantially similar to those described in the Stipulation with the DOJ. On September 14, 2012, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement, which all states (except Minnesota), the District of Columbia and the United States territories joined. On October 15, 2012, Simon & Schuster paid the agreed upon amounts into an escrow account pending final court approval. On February 8, 2013, the court approved the proposed settlement following a final settlement approval hearing that day. On June 20, 2013, Simon & Schuster and certain other Publishing parties entered into a settlement agreement in the MDL litigation (as described below) covering claims of Minnesota residents (the "Minnesota Settlement"). The Minnesota Settlement was approved by the court on December 6, 2013. The Company believes that the settlements with the DOJ, the States and the Minnesota Settlement will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

 On December 9, 2011, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "MDL") issued an order consolidating in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York various purported class action suits that private litigants had filed in federal courts in California and New York. On January 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the court against the Publishing parties. These private litigant plaintiffs, who are e-book purchasers, allege that, among other things, the defendants are in violation of federal and/or state antitrust laws in connection with the sale of e-books pursuant to agency distribution arrangements between each of the publishers and e-book retailers. The consolidated amended class action complaint generally seeks multiple forms of damages for the purchase of e-books and injunctive and other relief. On March 2, 2012, the Publishing parties filed a motion to dismiss this action. On May 15, 2012, the court denied the motion to dismiss. As noted above, on June 20, 2013, Simon & Schuster entered into the Minnesota Settlement, which was approved by the court on December 6, 2013. Upon final approval of the Minnesota Settlement by the court, Simon & Schuster was dismissed with prejudice from the MDL litigation and only those individuals who elect to opt out of the States settlement or the Minnesota Settlement will have any potential claims against Simon & Schuster.  

 Similar antitrust suits have been filed against the Publishing parties by private litigants in Canada, purportedly as class actions, under Canadian law, commencing on February 24, 2012; and by an Australian e-book retailer in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York on September 16, 2013. Simon & Schuster intends to defend itself in these matters.  

 In addition, the European Commission (the "EC") and Canadian Competition Bureau (the "CCB") conducted separate competition investigations of agency distribution arrangements of e-books in this industry. On December 12, 2012, following the close of a comment period, the EC entered into settlement agreements with Simon & Schuster and certain Publishing parties. The CCB also entered into a settlement agreement with Simon & Schuster and certain Publishing parties, which was effective on February 7, 2014. These settlements require the adoption of certain business and compliance practices similar to those described in the Stipulation with the DOJ.  

 Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos-containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships.  

 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had pending approximately 45,150 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 45,900 as of December 31, 2012 and 50,090 as of December 31, 2011. During 2013, the Company received approximately 4,310 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 5,060 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the  

II-33 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2013 and 2012 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $29 million and $21 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.  

 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down during the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.  

 Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.  

 General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.  

 Market Risk  

 The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.  

II-34 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Foreign Exchange Risk  

 The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.  

 At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $136 million and $157 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.  

 Interest Rate Risk  

 The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent it has variable-rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $475 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.3%. In addition, in January 2014, Outdoor Americas borrowed $800 million under a variable-rate Term Loan, with an initial interest rate of 3.0%. While the Company does not currently use derivatives to modify its exposure to interest rates, it may do so in the future.  

 Credit Risk  

 The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.  

 The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2013 or 2012, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.
