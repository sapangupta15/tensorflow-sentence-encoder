ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company” or “ITW”) is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 56 countries. 

The Company periodically makes changes to its management reporting structure to better align its businesses with Company objectives and operating strategies. Effective January 1, 2013, the Company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprise-wide portfolio management initiative. As a result of this reorganization, the Company's continuing operations are internally reported as 28 operating segments to senior management as of December 31, 2013, which have been aggregated into the following seven external reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.

The significant changes that resulted from this reorganization included the following:

•Certain businesses within the former Transportation segment, primarily related to the automotive aftermarket business, are reported in the Polymers & Fluids segment and the Transportation segment has been renamed Automotive OEM.

•The Welding business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, is reported separately as the Welding segment.

•The Electronics business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, has been combined with the Test & Measurement business, which was formerly reported in the All Other segment, to form a new Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.

•The All Other segment has been renamed Specialty Products.

The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2013.

Commensurate with the change in reportable segments described above, the segment operating income was also revised for a change in how the operating expenses maintained at the corporate level are allocated to the Company's segments. Prior to January 1, 2013, the Company allocated all operating expenses maintained at the corporate level to its segments. Beginning January 1, 2013, segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segment's revenues. Expenses not charged to the segments are now reported separately as Unallocated. Because the Unallocated category includes a variety of items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.

The prior year segment results and related disclosures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation under the new segment structure and expense allocation methodology.

Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.

Management analyzes the Company's consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment's operating margin.

80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS 

A key element of the Company’s business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. The Company utilizes the 80/20 process in various aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:

•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.

•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.

•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.

•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.

The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs, and improve profitability and returns. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to apply this 80/20 business process and improve results.

ENTERPRISE STRATEGY 

During 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy that includes three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns. 

Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company's differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased over historical periods in 2012 and 2013 and is expected to increase further in 2014 with the planned divestiture of the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services, as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the focus will be on businesses with sustainable differentiation and growth potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company's discontinued operations.

Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure. 

Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses. This initiative is expected to transform sourcing into a core strategic function in the Company.

DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN FORMER DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT

On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Effective November 1, 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. 

In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and is no longer presenting this segment as part of its continuing operations.

On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close by mid-2014.

In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. The construction distribution and specialty coatings businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.

In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.

These held for sale businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. All related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company's discontinued operations.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company’s consolidated results of operations for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2013 and 2012, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

17

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 4.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to divestitures which reduced revenues by 6.3% over the prior year. On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the former Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Excluding the 2012 revenues of the former Decorative Surfaces segment of $921 million, 2013 revenues increased by $265 million, or 1.9%, over the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenues from acquisitions and higher base revenues (see "Results of Operations by Segment" table below). Worldwide base revenues increased 0.2% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the electronic assembly equipment businesses within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. International base revenues increased 1.2% due to growth in Asia Pacific of 3.6%, primarily due to the result of strong growth in China in 2013 versus 2012. European base revenues declined 0.8% due to weakness in the European economic environment in the first half of 2013 which moderately improved in the second half of the year. North American base revenues were lower by 0.5% primarily due to the electronic assembly business within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. This was partially offset by growth in the North American Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, and Construction Products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 1.7% to revenues in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the purchase of a European consumer packaging equipment business and a Chinese food equipment business. 

Revenues increased 1.9% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation and the reduction of revenues due to divestitures. Divestitures reduced revenues by 1.3% primarily due to only ten months of operating results for the Decorative Surfaces segment in 2012 versus twelve months of operating results in 2011 as the Company divested a 51% interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment on October 31, 2012, at which time the segment was deconsolidated. Base revenues increased 2.2% in 2012 versus 2011 as North American economic conditions were stronger than the European and Asia Pacific economic environments. North American base revenues increased 4.3% in 2012 versus 2011. International base revenues decreased 0.2% as Europe declined 0.9% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily driven by weakness in Southern Europe. Asia Pacific base revenues increased 0.7% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM segment across the region. Acquisitions contributed 3.5% to revenues primarily due to the purchase of a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids in the first quarter of 2012 and a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer in the third quarter of 2011. Currency translation resulted in a 2.5% decline in revenues primarily due to a weaker Euro versus the year ago period. 

Operating Income

Operating income increased 1.6% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower overhead expenses and an increase in base revenues, partially offset by the divestiture of the former Decorative Surfaces segment and higher restructuring expenses. Total base operating margins increased 120 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 110 basis points in 2013 versus 2012, driven by reductions in overhead expenses from the Company's enterprise initiatives of 80 basis points, resulting primarily from the benefits of business structure simplification activities, and the favorable effect of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 40 basis points.

Operating income increased 4.8% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to improved variable margins and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. Currency translation resulted in a 2.4% decline in operating income primarily due to a weaker Euro versus the year ago period. Higher restructuring expenses due to increased cost reduction activities also negatively impacted operating income by 2.0%. Base margins increased 120 basis points primarily due to improved variable margins. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs improved base margins 110 basis points primarily due to the favorable effect of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 60 basis points and benefits of restructuring projects. The increase in base margins was partially offset by a 60 basis point decline related to acquisitions, primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets. Restructuring expenses diluted total operating margins by 30 basis points primarily due to restructuring activities related to continued improvements in operating structure and efficiencies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 5.3% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to a decline in base business, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Worldwide electronics base business revenues decreased 14.0% in 2013 versus 2012, primarily due to a 36.1% decrease in revenues in the electronic assembly businesses resulting primarily from strong order rates from a key customer in 2012 that did not recur in 2013. Base revenues for the other electronics businesses increased 3.1% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to increased demand from consumer electronics customers in China. Base revenues for the worldwide test and measurement businesses increased 2.0% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to increased order rates during the fourth quarter of 2013. The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a European food and pharmaceutical inspection business in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Revenues increased 14.4% in 2012 versus 2011 due to the increase in revenues from acquisitions and base revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the worldwide test and measurement businesses increased 7.1% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to increased equipment orders both internationally and in North America. Worldwide electronics base business revenues increased 0.5% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to base revenue growth of 7.9% in the electronic assembly businesses driven by strong order rates from a key electronics customer, partially offset by a 4.0% decline in the other electronics businesses as consumer demand for basic cell phones and computers was weaker. The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer in the third quarter of 2011.

21

Operating Income

Operating income decreased 6.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the lower base revenues noted above. Total base operating margins decreased 20 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues of 190 basis points, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 170 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to benefits from business structure simplification activities and overhead cost management of 60 basis points, lower intangible asset amortization expense of 40 basis points, favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 30 basis points, and a one-time claim recovery of 30 basis points in 2013. 

Operating income increased 13.8% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the growth in base revenues, changes in variable margins and overhead costs, and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base operating margins increased 170 basis points due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues of 90 basis points and the changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 80 basis points, primarily due to favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 50 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 140 basis points versus the prior year. Higher restructuring expenses decreased total operating margins by 30 basis points due to increased cost reduction activities in 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

22

Operating Revenues

Revenues increased 5.5% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and an increase in base revenues. North American base revenues increased 3.8% in 2013 versus 2012 as North American service revenues increased 5.5% due to expanded service capabilities and improved market penetration, and equipment revenues increased 2.6% due to stronger growth in the second half of 2013. International base revenues declined 0.2% in 2013 versus 2012. International service revenues increased 3.9% primarily due to expanded service capabilities in Europe. International equipment revenues declined 2.0% over the prior year primarily due to lower European sales in the cooking businesses in France and Italy. Improved European equipment sales in the second half of 2013 partially offset the revenue decline in the first half of 2013. The increase in revenues from acquisitions was due to the purchase of a Brazilian manufacturer of cooking equipment in the fourth quarter of 2012 and a Chinese food equipment business in the third quarter of 2013. 

Revenues decreased 2.4% in 2012 versus 2011 due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, which was partially offset by the growth in base business. North American base revenues increased 3.0% in 2012 versus 2011 as equipment revenues increased 2.7% and service revenues grew 3.6%. The increase in equipment revenues was driven by growth in certain institutional, restaurant, and retail markets but declined in the fourth quarter of 2012, largely due to slower demand from institutional customers in budget constrained sectors. The increase in service revenues was partly due to expanded service capabilities and improved market penetration. International base revenues decreased 2.0% in 2012 versus 2011 as equipment revenues decreased 4.2%, primarily due to lower European sales in the cooking businesses, partially offset by product penetration gains in China and Brazil. International service revenues increased 3.4% driven by expanded service capabilities in Europe.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 15.7% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses and higher base revenues. Total base operating margins increased 220 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 170 basis points primarily due to higher variable margins of 120 basis points, driven by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 60 basis points and operating efficiencies primarily in the North American service business, and lower overhead expenses of 50 basis points resulting primarily from the benefits of business structure simplification activities.

Operating income increased 6.3% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to improved variable margins and productivity improvements, higher base revenues, and a decrease in restructuring expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base operating margins increased 120 basis points primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 110 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the positive impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 60 basis points and a 50 basis point improvement from lower operating expenses due to productivity improvements in North America and Europe.

In 2013 and 2012, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 3.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the polymers and hygiene businesses decreased 5.3%, worldwide fluids decreased 2.3% and the automotive aftermarket businesses declined 1.6% in 2013 versus 2012. Revenue declines were primarily due to product line simplification (PLS) activities, exiting low margin business and the loss of certain product sales. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a manufacturer of advanced technology silicone materials in the second quarter of 2012.

Revenues increased 0.2% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide base revenues for the polymers and hygiene businesses decreased 4.0% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily driven by a decrease in European sales, especially in Spain, and from exiting low margin business. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids business decreased 1.2% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to decreased sales in Europe, partially offset by modest growth in North America and Brazil. Worldwide base revenues for the automotive aftermarket businesses declined 4.0% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the loss of a major product line with a key customer and decreased demand for car care products in Europe, partially offset by higher demand in the U.S. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a North American automotive aftermarket business in the first quarter of 2011, a manufacturer of advanced technology silicone materials in the second quarter of 2012, a European specialty chemical business in the first quarter of 2012, and a European automotive aftermarket business in the third quarter of 2011.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 2.5% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower base revenues, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring expenses. Total base operating margins increased 110 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs, partially offset by the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base operating margins by 190 basis points primarily due to lower overhead expenses of 130 basis points, primarily driven by the benefits of business structure simplification activities and overhead cost management, and favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 50 basis points.

Operating income decreased 1.0% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the decrease in base revenues, the unfavorable effect of currency translation, and higher restructuring expenses, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs and income from acquisitions. Total base operating margins increased 80 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 180 basis points, partially offset by the impact of the decrease in base revenues noted above. The positive impact from changes in variable margins and overhead costs was primarily due to the favorable impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 80 basis points and lower overhead costs of 90 basis points, primarily due to the benefits of restructuring projects. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 60 basis points primarily due to the impact of intangible asset amortization expense.

Revenues decreased 0.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to a decline in base business, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Worldwide welding base revenues declined 2.3% in 2013 versus 2012. North American welding base business revenues were lower by 2.2% due to heavy equipment OEM and general industrial end market declines. International base business revenues decreased 2.6% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the ongoing strategic exit from the Chinese ship building end market. The increase from acquisition revenues was primarily due to the purchase of a European supplier of welding consumables in the first quarter of 2013.

25

Revenues increased 7.1% in 2012 versus 2011 due to growth in base business and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide welding base revenues increased 6.8% in 2012 versus 2011, but softened in the fourth quarter, as worldwide revenues declined 1.3% in the fourth quarter largely due to a 5.4% decline in the international welding base business. North American welding base revenues increased 7.6% in 2012 versus 2011 due to growth in oil and gas end markets for the full year and increased sales to heavy equipment OEM's in the first half of 2012, with slowed growth in heavy equipment OEM demand in the second half of the year. Base revenues for the international welding businesses increased 4.7% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to growth in international oil and gas markets, partially offset by a weak Chinese ship building end market. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a thermal insulation manufacturer and service provider in the third quarter of 2011.

Operating Income

Operating income decreased 1.3% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower base revenues, lower income from acquisitions, and higher restructuring expenses, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Total base operating margins increased 50 basis points primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by the negative operating leverage effect of base revenue declines. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 90 basis points driven by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 70 basis points and lower overhead costs including the benefits of business structure simplification activities. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 50 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating margins and the impact of intangible asset amortization expense.

Operating income increased 6.5% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the growth in base revenues, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs and higher restructuring expenses due to increased cost reduction activities. Base margins increased 50 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the growth in base business of 90 basis points, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs decreased base margins by 40 basis points primarily due to higher overhead expenses of 130 basis points, including investments in emerging markets related to the oil and gas businesses, partially offset by the favorable impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 90 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 40 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to lower operating margins and the impact of intangible asset amortization expense.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

26

In 2013 and 2012, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues 

Revenues decreased 0.5% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in base revenues. North American base revenues increased 4.6% in 2013 versus 2012 as U.S. residential base revenue growth was 8.2% primarily due to increased consumable sales associated with year-over-year growth in housing starts. U.S. renovation base revenue growth was 7.3% primarily due to strong tool sales and increased sales to big box retailers. U.S. commercial base revenues declined 1.4% primarily due to weak overall demand. International base revenues declined 1.6% in 2013 versus 2012, as European base revenues declined 5.3% due to lower sales of consumable products driven by a slowdown in construction activity in European end markets. Base revenues in Asia Pacific increased 2.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to growth in commercial and residential construction activity in Australia and New Zealand.

Revenues decreased 1.5% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in base revenues. In North America, base revenue growth for residential, renovation and commercial construction was 8.3%, 7.1% and 5.4%, respectively. The North American base revenue increase was driven by improved U.S. housing starts as well as a modest increase in commercial construction square footage activity. International base revenues declined 2.3% as European base revenues declined 4.0% due to lower sales of consumable products driven by a slowdown in construction activity in all European end markets. Base revenues in Asia Pacific declined 0.2% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to lower renovation and commercial construction activity in Australia and New Zealand. 

Operating Income

Operating income increased 19.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses and higher base revenues, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Total base margins increased 280 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased total base margins by 260 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 due to lower overhead costs of 210 basis points, primarily driven by the benefits of business structure simplification activities and overhead cost management, and higher variable margins of 50 basis points. Restructuring expenses reduced total operating margins by 30 basis points due to increased cost reduction activities in Europe.

Operating income decreased 8.8% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to higher restructuring expenses, higher operating expenses, and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by income from acquisitions and higher base revenues. Base margins were flat versus the prior year, as the favorable operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues was offset by higher operating expenses in Europe. Restructuring expenses reduced total operating margins by 120 basis points due to increased cost reduction activities worldwide.

The results of operations for the Specialty Products segment for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2013 and 2012, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues increased 7.3% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to an increase in acquisition and base business revenues, and the favorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide consumer packaging base revenues increased 2.5% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to growth in multi-pack beverage systems. Worldwide appliance base business revenues declined 3.0% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower consumer demand in the European home appliance sector. Worldwide base revenues of the ground support equipment business increased 1.1% in 2013 versus 2012. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the third quarter 2013 purchase of a European consumer packaging equipment business and the fourth quarter 2012 purchase of a North American medical products manufacturer.

Revenues increased 0.9% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and an increase in base business, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide consumer packaging base revenues increased 0.4% as higher sales in both the global packaging solutions business and the plastics and security business were partially offset by lower sales related to the reclosable packaging business and the worldwide foils and transfer ribbon business. Worldwide appliance base revenue growth was 5.8% primarily due to market penetration and improved customer demand in 

28

North America in 2012 versus 2011. Worldwide base revenues of the ground support equipment business decreased 5.2% in 2012 versus 2011. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the first quarter 2012 purchase of a manufacturer of thermal transfer ribbons for bar coding and labeling applications.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 11.7% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses, an increase in base revenues, and income from acquisitions. Total base operating margins increased 160 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues of 30 basis points. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 130 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 driven by lower overhead expenses of 120 basis points, primarily resulting from the benefits of business structure simplification activities, and improvements in variable margins of 10 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 60 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets.

Operating income decreased 4.7% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to higher restructuring expenses, the unfavorable effect of currency translation, and lower income from acquisitions, partially offset by the growth in base revenues. Total base margins increased 10 basis points due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 70 basis points primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets. Higher restructuring expenses decreased total operating margins by 50 basis points due to increased cost reduction activities in 2012.

DECORATIVE SURFACES

The Decorative Surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.

On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the "Investment Agreement") to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R"). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC ("Wilsonart"). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, effective November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

Historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces for 2012 and 2011 were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues declined 15.0% and operating income decreased 7.1% in 2012 versus 2011 due to there being only ten months of operating results in 2012 versus twelve months of operating results in 2011 as the Company divested a 51% interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment on October 31, 2012.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $250 million in 2013 from $252 million in 2012, due to various intangible assets being fully amortized. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $252 million in 2012 versus $219 million in 2011, due to intangible asset amortization for acquired businesses, most notably a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment acquired in the beginning of 2012.

29

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2013, 2012 and 2011. In 2013, these assessments resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and an intangible asset impairment charge of $2 million related to a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. In 2012, these assessments resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $1 million related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment and an intangible asset impairment charge of $1 million related to a retail food weighing business in the Food Equipment segment. There were no impairment charges in 2011. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense increased to $239 million in 2013, which includes the full year impact of interest expense on the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $213 million in 2012. Interest expense increased in 2012, which includes the full year impact of interest expense on the 3.375% notes and 4.875% notes issued in late August 2011 and the interest expense related to the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $191 million in 2011. The increase was partially offset by lower interest expense on the 6.55% preferred debt securities, which were fully paid on the first business day in 2012. The weighted-average interest rate on the Company's commercial paper was 0.2% in 2013, 0.2% in 2012 and 0.1% in 2011.

GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $933 million ($632 million after-tax) related to the sale of a 51% majority interest in the former Decorative Surfaces segment. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other income (expense) was income of $72 million in 2013 versus $11 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million recorded in the first quarter of 2013 related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment, higher interest income ($50 million in 2013 versus $38 million in 2012) and lower equity investment losses related to Wilsonart ($14 million in 2013 versus $30 million in 2012). See the Other Income (Expense) note and the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion.

Other income (expense) was income of $11 million in 2012 versus $53 million in 2011 primarily due to an equity investment loss related to Wilsonart of $30 million in 2012, lower income from investments ($11 million in 2012 versus $17 million in 2011) and losses on foreign currency transactions ($10 million in 2012 versus $3 million in 2011).

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate was 30.6% in 2013, 30.3% in 2012, and 20.2% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2013 was unfavorably impacted by a $40 million discrete tax charge in the third quarter of 2013 related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for 2012 was unfavorably impacted by discrete tax charges totaling $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included $35 million for the settlement of an IRS tax audit for the years 2008-2009. The effective tax rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by the discrete non-cash tax benefit of $166 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the decision in the Company’s favor by the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions that had been challenged by the Australian Tax Office. 

See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details on these discrete tax adjustments and a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

For the twelve months of 2013 versus 2012, the impact of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased operating revenues by approximately $9 million in 2013 and did not have a significant impact on income from continuing operations. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2012 versus 2011 decreased operating revenues by approximately $357 million in 2012 and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $36 million ($0.08 per diluted share).

30

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Income from discontinued operations was $49 million in 2013, $637 million in 2012 and $296 million in 2011. Income from discontinued operations in 2013 included after-tax losses on disposals of $72 million and goodwill impairment of $42 million related to various divested businesses. Income from discontinued operations in 2012 included an after-tax gain of $372 million related to the sale of the finishing group of businesses. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $3.6 billion of cash on hand at December 31, 2013 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include: 

•investment in existing businesses to fund internal growth;

•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; 

•share repurchases; and 

•acquisitions.

In September 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale in the third quarter of 2013 and is no longer presenting this segment as part of its continuing operations. As to the impact of this divestiture on the Company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the Company also indicated that it intended to utilize its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. As a result, the Company repurchased approximately 14 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and expects to repurchase approximately 35 million additional shares through a program that is expected to conclude no later than the end of 2014.

On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close by mid-2014.

The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.

Cash Flow

The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.

31

Summarized cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash dividends paid during 2013 do not include the dividend payment of $174 million originally scheduled to be paid in January 2013, which was accelerated and paid in December 2012.

On August 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2007 Program”). Under the 2007 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 16.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $53.51 per share during 2011. As of December 31, 2011, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 Program.

On May 6, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). Under the 2011 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.20 per share during 2011, approximately 35.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $56.93 per share during 2012 and approximately 26.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $71.89 per share during 2013. As of December 31, 2013, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.

On August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $81.62 per share during December 2013. As of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $5.7 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 Program.

Adjusted Return on Average Invested Capital

The Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital (“adjusted ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. To improve comparability of adjusted ROIC in the periods presented, after-tax operating income excludes the operating income of the former Decorative Surfaces segment. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Decorative Surfaces and Industrial Packaging segments, and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.

32

Adjusted ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted ROIC increased 180 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 as a result of improvement in after-tax operating income of 8.4% and a decrease in adjusted average invested capital of 3.7%. 

Adjusted ROIC decreased 30 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 as a result of an increase in average invested capital of 5.1%, while after-tax operating income increased 3.4%. 

The 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $40 million related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. The 2012 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $36 million, which included $35 million for the settlement of an IRS tax audit for the years 2008-2009. The 2011 effective tax rate included a discrete tax benefit of $166 million for an Australian tax matter. 

A reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate excluding the discrete tax items is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

33

Working Capital

Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at December 31, 2013 and 2012 is summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in net working capital as of December 31, 2013 was primarily due to current maturities of long-term debt, including $1.0 billion of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014 and $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, and a $1.2 billion increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by the reclassification of net noncurrent assets and liabilities of $1.1 billion to assets and liabilities held for sale. 

Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2012, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2013, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.

Debt

Total debt and total debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2013, the Company reclassified $1.0 billion of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014 and $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014 from long-term to short-term debt. 

The Company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund share repurchases and small and medium-sized acquisitions. The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of August 15, 2018 and $1.5 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017. No amounts were outstanding under these two facilities at December 31, 2013. The Company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately $1.7 billion and $408 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, which is included in short-term debt. The maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2013 was $1.7 billion, while the 

34

average daily balance was $576 million. The increase in commercial paper resulted primarily from the funding of share repurchases during 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the Company’s foreign operations had authorized credit facilities of $439 million, of which $12 million was outstanding and $102 million was committed for guarantees. 

On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion short-term line of credit agreement with a term of up to 364 days to provide additional liquidity under the Company's commercial paper program in order to fund short-term capital allocation needs. Management may also seek to refinance a portion of its short-term debt with longer term debt during 2014.

Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA

The Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, gain on sale of interest in Decorative Surfaces, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.

Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company's debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased from 1.7 to 2.1 in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the increase in short-term debt related to $1.2 billion of additional commercial paper borrowings.

Stockholders’ Equity

The changes to stockholders' equity during 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

35

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $164 million. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. 

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had open stand-by letters of credit of approximately $184 million, of which approximately $132 million expires in 2014. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2013.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. Various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The Company's critical accounting policies are as follows:

Realizability of Inventories — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:

In addition, for approximately 20% of total inventories, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method due to the effects of inflation.

Collectibility of Accounts Receivable — The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.

Depreciation of Plant and Equipment — The Company’s U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:

Buildings and improvements150% declining balance

Machinery and equipment200% declining balance

The majority of the Company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations.

Income Taxes — The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected

levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets — The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of $6.9 billion allocated to its reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Company’s 80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $30 million to $1.1 billion, with the average amount equal to $246 million.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Company’s global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits — The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. Pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.

The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $31 million.

The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2013 and will be 7.6% for 2014. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.
