ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EDISON INTERNATIONAL OVERVIEW

Highlights of Operating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Includes termination of Edison Capital's cross-border leases in 2009 and state tax impact of the Global Settlement with the IRS.

Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (losses) by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings (losses) are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including lease terminations, sale of certain assets, early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings.

SCE's 2011 core earnings increased $101 million primarily due to rate base growth. 

EMG's 2011 core earnings declined $217 million due to lower realized energy and capacity prices along with lower 

33
generation from merchant coal plants, higher plant maintenance costs from outages, higher interest expense related to renewable projects, and lower trading income. 

Edison International Parent and Other 2011 core results changed primarily due to higher tax benefits in 2011 compared to 2010.

Consolidated non-core items for Edison International included:

•An after-tax earnings charge of $1.09 billion ($1.76 billion pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulting primarily from the impairment the Homer City, Fisk, Crawford and Waukegan power plants, wind related charges, write-down of a net investment in aircraft leases with American Airlines, and the impact on Edison International consolidated deferred income taxes resulting from an increase in the state apportionment rates due to such impairment charges as discussed further below and in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

•An after tax earnings benefit of $175 million recorded in 2010 relating to the California impact of the federal Global Settlement resulting from acceptance by the California Franchise Tax Board of tax positions finalized with the IRS in 2009 and receipt of the final interest determination from the Franchise Tax Board. For further discussion of the Global Settlement, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes."

•An after-tax earnings charge of $39 million recorded in 2010 to reverse previously recognized federal tax benefits eliminated by federal health care legislation enacted in 2010. The health care law eliminated the federal tax deduction for retiree health care costs to the extent those costs are eligible for federal Medicare Part D subsidies.

•An after-tax earnings charge of $24 million ($40 million pre-tax) recorded in 2010 resulting from the write-off of capitalized engineering and other costs related to a change in air emission control technology selection at EMG's Powerton Station.

See "SCE: Results of Operations" for discussion of SCE results of operations, including a comparison of 2010 results to 2009. Also, see "EMG: Results of Operations" for discussion of EMG results of operations, including a comparison of 2010 results to 2009.

Management Overview of SCE

SCE's core mission is to deliver safe, reliable and affordable electric service to its customers. Accomplishing this mission requires balancing competing priorities, including public policies regarding air and water quality, energy efficiency and renewable energy and the need to replace aging infrastructure. The accumulation of several major policy mandates is expected to add significantly to the cost of electric service, which could cause a growing number of customers to seek to self-generate their power. Choices by customers to self-generate results in fewer kilowatt hour sales to absorb the increasing costs of the electrical system, further increasing rates for SCE's other customers. Working with policy makers to balance competing priorities, a key focus of SCE is to manage the costs that drive increases in electricity rates while delivering safe and reliable electric service to its customers.

2012 CPUC General Rate Case

SCE filed its 2012 GRC application in November 2010. In October 2011, SCE submitted updated testimony to reflect changes in escalation rates, known changes due to governmental actions and changes in the timing of recovery for nuclear refueling outages at San Onofre, which taken together changed its requested 2012 base rate revenue requirement to $6.3 billion. SCE's updated request, after considering the effects of sales growth and including the impacts of reducing SCE's solar program as approved by the CPUC, would result in incremental customer base rate increases of $809 million, $117 million and $513 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

The Division of Ratepayer Advocates ("DRA") recommended that SCE's requested 2012 base rate revenue requirement be decreased by approximately $850 million, comprised of approximately $630 million in operation and maintenance expense reductions and approximately $220 million in capital-related revenue requirement reductions. The Utility Reform Network ("TURN") and other intervenors recommended an additional $610 million revenue requirement reduction, beyond the DRA adjustments, primarily capital-related in nature, as well as disallowances of recorded capital investments for specific projects. Intervenors have also recommended changes to SCE's proposed post-test year ratemaking methodology to be used for 2013 and 2014 as well as limiting the recovery amount of SCE's pension costs. A final decision on the GRC is expected in the first half of 2012. The CPUC has authorized the establishment of a GRC memorandum account, which will make the 2012 revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the CPUC effective as of January 1, 2012. Recognition of the revenue for the 

34
period January 1, 2012 through the date of a final decision, as well as any delays in certain expenditures, may impact the timing of earnings in 2012.

FERC Formula Rates

The FERC has accepted, subject to refund and settlement procedures, SCE's request to implement formula rates as a means to determine SCE's FERC transmission revenue requirement effective January 1, 2012. The formula rates include revenue requirements related to construction work in progress ("CWIP") that was previously recovered through a separate mechanism. SCE estimates its total 2012 FERC weighted average ROE will be 11.1%, including the previously authorized 50 basis point incentive for CAISO participation and individual authorized project incentives. The actual weighted average ROE and rate base is dependent upon the amount and timing of capital expenditures among FERC incentive and non-incentive projects. SCE's request proposed the adoption of a specific formula to calculate a forecasted annual revenue requirement that is used to establish rates and is trued-up annually to allow SCE to recover its actual revenue requirement, including its actual cost of service, actual rate base and the authorized return on investment. SCE's request also allows SCE to make single-issue rate filings requesting changes to certain elements of the formula, including the base ROE, depreciation rates and the retail rate structure. SCE and the other parties to the proceeding are currently in settlement negotiations. 

Capital Program

During 2011, SCE continued execution of its capital investment program. Total capital expenditures (including accruals) were $3.9 billion in 2011 compared to $3.8 billion in 2010. The level of future spending is significantly dependent on a final outcome of SCE's 2012 GRC decision and the timing, scope and approvals of major transmission projects. SCE's capital program for 2012 – 2014 is focused primarily in the following areas:

•Maintaining reliability and expanding the capability of SCE's transmission and distribution system.

•Upgrading and constructing new transmission lines and substations for system reliability and increased access to renewable energy, including the Tehachapi, Devers-Colorado River, Eldorado-Ivanpah, and Red Bluff projects.

•Completing installation of digital meters in households and small businesses, referred to as EdisonSmartConnectTM. Through 2011, SCE installed 3.8 million meters and plans to install the remaining 1.2 million meters during 2012.

•Generation capital projects for nuclear and hydro-electric plants.

SCE forecasts capital expenditures in the range of $11.8 billion to $13.2 billion for 2012 – 2014. Actual capital spending will be affected by: changes in regulatory, environmental and engineering design requirements; permitting and project delays; cost and availability of labor, equipment and materials; and other factors as discussed further under "SCE: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Investment Plan." SCE has experienced significant cost pressures on its Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River Transmission Projects, primarily related to environmental monitoring and mitigation costs, scope changes and schedule delays. Currently, SCE is completing the final engineering design for these projects and expects to file revised cost estimates with the CPUC later this year. Subject to further permitting and schedule delays, SCE has revised its direct capital expenditure estimates for the Tehachapi Project to $2.5 billion from $2.1 billion and revised its estimates for the Devers-Colorado River Project to $860 million from $649 million. The Tehachapi Project may be further impacted by issues related to aviation marking and lighting and community opposition to portions of the line, as further discussed in "SCE: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Investment Plan." Capital program cost increases have been partially offset by expenditures for other transmission reliability projects, which were deferred due to delays from once-through cooling requirements for coastal generating plants. SCE plans to utilize cash generated from its operations, tax benefits and issuance of additional debt and preferred equity to fund its capital needs.

Management Overview of EMG

EMG's competitive power generation business primarily consists of the generation and sale into the PJM market of energy and capacity from merchant coal-fired power plants and a portfolio of natural gas and wind projects. EMG's operating results were significantly lower in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower realized energy and capacity prices and generation at the coal plants. Power prices fell in the fourth quarter of 2011 and have continued to fall in 2012, driven by an abundance of low-priced natural gas, weather conditions and a slow economic recovery. Moreover, the abundance of low-priced natural gas has resulted in increased competition from natural gas-fired generating units in the markets in which Midwest Generation operates, and generation from Midwest Generation's plants has been correspondingly affected. Also at the end of 2011, a favorable long-term rail contract that supplied Midwest Generation's fleet expired and was replaced by a higher priced contract. EMG expects that Midwest Generation's average fuel cost ($/MWh) will increase by approximately one-third in 2012. Furthermore, Homer City is engaged in discussions with the owner-lessors regarding funding of retrofit expenditures 

35
for the Homer City plant that, if successful in providing funding, will likely result in EME's loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the Homer City plant. Finally, as discussed below, EMG recorded significant impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2011. 

At December 31, 2011, EME had corporate cash and cash equivalents of $951 million and $498 million of available borrowing capacity under its $564 million revolving credit facility maturing in June 2012 and Midwest Generation had cash and cash equivalents of $213 million and $497 million of available borrowing capacity under its $500 million credit facility maturing in June 2012. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, EME terminated its revolving credit facility, and there can be no assurance that Midwest Generation will be eligible to draw on its credit facility prior to maturity. Any replacements of these credit lines will likely be on less favorable terms and conditions, and there is no assurance that EME will, or will be able to, replace these credit lines or any portion of them. EME had $3.7 billion of unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2011, $500 million of which mature in 2013.

Unless energy and capacity prices increase, EMG expects that it will incur further reductions in cash flow and losses in years subsequent to 2012 as well as in 2012, and a continuation of these adverse trends coupled with pending debt maturities and the need to retrofit its plants to comply with governmental regulations will strain EMG's liquidity. To address such scenario, EMG would need to consider all options available to it, including potential sales of assets or restructurings or reorganization of the capital structure of EMG and its subsidiaries. EMG's current business plans are focused on liquidity and operating effectively through the current commodity price cycle and on environmental compliance as described below.

Midwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs

During 2011, Midwest Generation continued to advance necessary activities for NOx and SO2 controls to meet the requirements of the CPS. Midwest Generation does not anticipate a material change to its current approach in order to comply with the MATS rule. Midwest Generation expects to continue to develop and implement a compliance program that includes the operations of ACI systems, upgrades to particulate removal systems and the use of dry sorbent injection, combined with its use of low sulfur PRB coal, to meet emissions limits for criteria pollutants, such as NOx and SO2 as well as for hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury, acid gas and non-mercury metals.

A significant decline in power prices from September 30, 2011, combined with new environmental regulations and public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal-fired power plants. Decisions regarding whether or not to proceed with retrofitting any particular remaining units to comply with CPS requirements for SO2 emissions, including those that have received permits, are subject to a number of factors, such as market conditions, regulatory and legislative developments, liquidity and forecasted commodity prices and capital and operating costs applicable at the time decisions are required or made. Midwest Generation may also elect to shut down units, instead of installing controls, to be in compliance with the CPS. Decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns Midwest Generation may ultimately employ also remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made. Final decisions on whether to install controls, to install particular kinds of controls, and to actually expend capital or continue with the expenditure of capital will be made as required, subject to the requirements of the CPS and other applicable regulations. In February 2012, Midwest Generation decided to shut down the Fisk Station by the end of 2012 and the Crawford Station by the end of 2014 and concluded it was less likely to retrofit the Waukegan Station rather than the larger Powerton, Joliet and Will County Stations. As a result, EMG recorded an impairment charge of $640 million at December 31, 2011 related to the Crawford, Fisk and Waukegan Stations. For further discussion, see "Edison International (Consolidated): Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets—Application to Midwest Generation Stations" and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other." Units that are not retrofitted may continue to operate until required to shut down by applicable regulations or operate with reduced output.

In connection with its decision to close the Fisk and Crawford Stations, Midwest Generation entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Chicago, acting through the Commissioner of Health, which acknowledges that the cessation of coal-fired electric generation at the Fisk and Crawford Stations will achieve the objectives of the proposed Chicago Clean Power Ordinance without a need to pass the proposed Clean Power Ordinance or similar ordinances (recognizing that such agreement cannot bind the Chicago City Council or its members). Midwest Generation and the City of Chicago have also agreed to collaborate with key stakeholders to consider potential future uses, ownership and sources of external funding to transition the sites for such uses. The closure of the Fisk and Crawford Stations will be subject to review for reliability by PJM Interconnection LLC, the regional transmission organization that controls the area where these plants are located. In total, Midwest Generation estimates 150 to 180 employees will be affected. The timing and amount of severance benefits, if any, will be determined after completion of review of personnel based on seniority and other factors and, in the case of the Crawford Station, the amount may be affected by the timing of the plant closure. Other obligations related to the Fisk and Crawford Stations could be affected by the plant closing, including sales of capacity, for which Midwest Generation is unable 

36
to reasonably estimate the impact, or range of impacts, that could be incurred. Midwest Generation does not expect to incur future capital expenditures to close these plants. 

Based on work to date, Midwest Generation estimates the cost of retrofitting the large stations (Powerton, Joliet Units 7 and 8 and Will County) using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents to comply with CPS requirements for SO2 emissions, and the associated upgrading of existing particulate removal systems, would be up to approximately $628 million. The cost of retrofitting Joliet Unit 6 is not included in the large unit amounts as it is less likely that Midwest Generation will make retrofits for this unit. The estimated cost of retrofitting Joliet Unit 6, if made, would be approximately $75 million, while the estimated cost of retrofitting the Waukegan Station, if made, would be approximately $160 million. For further discussion related to EMG's impairment policy on the unit of account, see "Edison International (Consolidated): Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets."

In February 2012, Midwest Generation received an extension of its permit to install a dry sorbent injection system at the Powerton Station.

Homer City Lease

Homer City engaged a financial advisor and conducted a bidding process to obtain capital funding from third parties during the second half of 2011 to partially finance the installation of the environmental improvements. During the fourth quarter of 2011, such efforts failed to obtain sufficient interest from market participants necessary to fund the capital needed to make such improvements under the current lease arrangement. Homer City does not currently have sufficient capital and does not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to complete retrofits. EMG is under no legal obligation to, and has chosen not to, provide funding. Restrictions under the agreements entered into as part of Homer City's 2001 sale-leaseback transaction affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, Homer City's ability to incur indebtedness or make capital expenditures. Consequently, Homer City's ability to install environmental compliance equipment will be dependent on funding from the owner-lessors or third parties. Homer City is currently engaged in discussions with the owner-lessors regarding the potential for such funding. EMG expects that the outcome of any such discussions, if successful in providing funding for the Homer City plant, will likely result in EMG's loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the Homer City plant. Failure to resolve the source of funding of necessary capital expenditures for the Homer City plant could result in Homer City's default under the lease agreements giving rise to remedies for the owner-lessors and secured lease obligation bondholders, which could include foreclosing on the leased assets, the general partner of Homer City, or both.

There is no assurance that an agreement will be reached with the owner-lessors or the existing secured lease obligation bondholders on funding the capital improvements. Homer City believes it is unlikely to meet the covenant requirements of its sale-leaseback documents relating to the payment of equity rent at April 1, 2012 and will be unable to make the required equity rent payment. There is no assurance that subsequent rent payments will be made. Under the sale-leaseback documents, rent payments are comprised of two components, senior rent and equity rent. Senior rent is used exclusively for debt service to secured lease obligation bondholders, while equity rent is paid to the owner-lessors. In order to pay equity rent, among other requirements, Homer City must meet historical and projected senior rent service coverage ratios of 1.7 to 1 (subject to reduction to 1.3 to 1 under certain circumstances). A failure to pay equity rent does not entitle the owner-lessors to foreclose upon Homer City's leasehold interest, but it does result in the suspension of Homer City's ability to make permitted distributions. Moreover, Homer City would be permanently restricted in its ability to make permitted distributions if a failure to pay equity rent when due was not cured within nine months, or even if cured, occurred more than one additional time during the term of the lease. Homer City is not subject to any minimum historical and projected senior rent service coverage ratios except as conditions to distributions and equity rent payments. Also, failure by Homer City to pay equity rent when due in April 2012 could trigger termination of the $48 million senior rent reserve letter of credit. Homer City would then be required to fund the senior rent reserve, and failure to do so could entitle counterparties to seek available remedies under the sale-leaseback documents, including termination or foreclosure upon the leasehold interest. As a result of the expectation that EMG is likely to lose substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the Homer City plant, EMG recorded an impairment charge of $1.03 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

Included in the consolidated financial statements are the assets and liabilities related to Homer City. In the event that EMG no longer controls Homer City, EMG will record a loss on disposition of assets and liabilities and likely classify Homer City as a discontinued operation. The loss on disposition will be determined based on the assets and liabilities at the date of disposition and an assessment whether any ongoing contingencies exist. For further discussion, see "Edison International (Consolidated): Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets—Application to Homer City Plant" and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

37
As a result of the financial outlook of Homer City, as previously discussed, EMG's subsidiary, EMMT, has ceased to enter into hedging activities related to future power sales, but continues to enter into energy and capacity transactions on behalf of Homer City pursuant to an intercompany agreement. Those transactions are generally back-to-back transactions in which EMMT enters into a transaction with a third party as a principal and then enters into an equivalent transaction with Homer City. In the case of capacity, EMMT has sold Homer City capacity in the annual PJM base residual auctions through May 2015. If Homer City were to default on its obligations to supply capacity, then EMMT would be liable to PJM to supply that capacity, and failure to do so would expose EMMT to penalties under the PJM tariffs. If one or more of the Homer City units were to be unavailable as a capacity resource and EMMT did not fulfill this obligation through market transactions, then EMMT would be required to refund any capacity payments received and would be assessed by PJM a penalty equal to the greater of 20% of the capacity payments or $20 per MW-day.

EMG's Renewable Energy Activities

Recent developments related to EMG renewable financing and development activities include:

•On December 21, 2011, EMG's subsidiary, EME closed a $242 million portfolio financing of three contracted wind projects representing 204 megawatts of generation capacity previously funded entirely with equity. Funding available in the amount of $110 million from the term loan facility, net of transaction costs, was distributed to EME in 2011 and approximately $95 million, net of transaction costs, of available funds is expected to be distributed in the first quarter of 2012 when the Pinnacle project achieves certain completion milestones.

•As part of its plan to obtain third-party equity capital to finance the development of a portion of EMG's wind portfolio, on February 13, 2012, Edison Mission Wind sold its indirect equity interests in the Cedro Hill wind project (150 MW in Texas), the Mountain Wind Power I project (61 MW in Wyoming) and the Mountain Wind Power II project (80 MW in Wyoming) to a new venture, Capistrano Wind Partners. Outside investors provided $238 million of the funding. Capistrano Wind Partners also agreed to acquire the Broken Bow I wind project (80 MW in Nebraska) and the Crofton Bluffs wind project (40 MW in Nebraska) for consideration expected to include $141 million from the same outside investors upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, including commencement of commercial operation and completion of project debt financing. The proceeds from outside investors net of costs on the projects to be completed are expected to be distributed to EMG and available for general corporate purposes. For additional information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Variable Interest Entities—Categories of Variable Interest Entities—Projects or Entities that are Consolidated."

During the fourth quarter of 2011, EMG significantly reduced development of renewable energy projects to conserve cash and in light of more limited market opportunities. As a result, EMG reduced staffing and has undertaken efforts to reduce funding joint development projects, thereby reducing the development pipeline of potential wind projects to a projected installed capacity to approximately 1,300 megawatts. These changes triggered charges of $34 million. In addition, management has reviewed the Storm Lake project and four small wind projects in Minnesota, and based on an expected future increase in operating costs and declines in long-term power prices that the projects could potentially realize following the term of the power purchase agreements, EMG has recorded an impairment charge of $30 million. For additional information on renewable energy projects, see "EMG: Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Investment Plan," "Edison International (Consolidated): Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets—Application to Selected Wind Projects," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SCE's results of operations are derived mainly through two sources:

•Utility earning activities – representing revenue authorized by the CPUC and FERC which is intended to provide SCE a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation, transmission and distribution assets. The annual revenue requirements are comprised of forecasted operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure. Also, included in utility earnings activities are revenues or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue, and regulatory charges or disallowances, if any. 

•Utility cost-recovery activities – representing CPUC- and FERC-authorized balancing accounts which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs incurred or provide for mechanisms to track and recover or refund differences in forecasted and actual amounts, subject to reasonableness review or compliance with upfront standards.

39
The following table is a summary of SCE's results of operations for the periods indicated. The presentation below separately identifies utility earning activities and utility cost-recovery activities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Effective January 1, 2010, SCE deconsolidated the Big 4 projects and therefore these projects are reflected in 2009 activities only (see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Variable Interest Entities" for further discussion).

2 Effective July 1, 2009, SCE transferred Mountainview Power Company, LLC to SCE. As a result of the transfer and for comparability purposes, Mountainview's 2009 activity was reclassified from cost-recovery activities to utility earning activities consistent with the revised recovery mechanism.

3 See use of Non-GAAP financial measures in "Edison International Overview—Highlights of Operating Results."

Utility Earning Activities

2011 vs. 2010

Utility earning activities were primarily affected by the following:

•Higher operating revenue of $296 million primarily due to the following:

•$135 million increase primarily due to a $215 million (4.35%) increase in 2011 authorized revenue approved in the 2009 CPUC GRC decision. The 2011 increase was partially offset by reductions of $80 million mainly resulting from revenue recognized in 2010 associated with the recovery of San Onofre Unit 3 scheduled outage costs with no comparable amount in 2011. 

40
•$95 million increase in FERC-related revenue primarily resulting from the inclusion of capital expenditures related to the Tehachapi Transmission Project in rate base.

•$25 million increase in capital-related revenue requirements related to the San Onofre steam generator replacement project and a $20 million increase for the EdisonSmartConnectTM project.

•$20 million increase related to recovery of legal costs incurred between 2004 and 2009 in support of SCE's efforts to obtain generator refunds related to claims arising out of the energy crisis in California in 2000 – 2001.

•Lower operation and maintenance expense of $63 million primarily due to costs incurred in 2010 related to the San Onofre Unit 3 scheduled outage.

•Higher depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense of $81 million primarily related to increased transmission and distribution investments.

•Higher net interest expense and other of $48 million primarily due to higher outstanding balances on long-term debt. For details of other income and expenses, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17. Other Income and Expenses."

•Higher income taxes primarily due to an increase in income as well as benefits recorded in 2010 related to the Global Settlement. See "—Income Taxes" below for more information.

2010 vs. 2009

Utility earning activities were primarily affected by the following:

•Higher operating revenue of $303 million primarily due to the following:

•$190 million increase primarily due to a 4.25% increase in 2010 authorized revenue approved in the 2009 CPUC GRC decision. 

•$55 million increase in FERC-related revenue, primarily due to the implementation of SCE's 2010 and 2009 FERC rate cases effective March 1, 2010 and March 1, 2009, respectively.

•$25 million increase in capital-related revenue requirements related to the San Onofre steam generator replacement project and a $20 million increase for the EdisonSmartConnect™ project.

•Higher operation and maintenance expense of $160 million primarily due to the following:

•$75 million of higher expenses to support company growth programs, including new information technology system requirements and facility maintenance.

•$45 million of higher transmission and distribution expenses to support system reliability and infrastructure replacement, right of way costs; preventive maintenance work, technical training and line clearing.

•$15 million of higher generation expenses primarily from a $25 million increase from the San Onofre Unit 2 and 3 scheduled outages, including $10 million of additional work identified during the Unit 2 scheduled outage, and a $10 million increase primarily due to overhaul and outage costs at Four Corners. These increases were partially offset by a $20 million decrease resulting from 2009 scheduled outages at the Mountainview power plant.

•$15 million of higher expense related to general liability and property insurance due to higher premiums for wildfire coverage.

•Higher depreciation expense of $89 million primarily related to increased capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs.

•Higher net interest expense and other of $32 million primarily due to:

•Lower other income of $19 million primarily related to a decrease in AFUDC – equity earnings due to the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base in the third quarter of 2009 partially offset by an increase in AFUDC – equity resulting from a higher capitalization rate and level of construction in progress associated with SCE's capital expenditure plan.

•Higher interest expense of $7 million primarily due to higher outstanding balances on long-term debt.

41
See "—Income Taxes" below for discussion of higher income taxes during 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.

Utility Cost-Recovery Activities

2011 vs. 2010

Utility cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by the following:

•Higher purchased power expense of $59 million primarily driven by the cost to replace CDWR contracts that expired in 2011, which were not previously recorded as an SCE cost but impacted customer bills (see "—Supplemental Operating Revenue Information" below), and higher costs associated with renewable contracts. The increase was partially offset by increased purchased power in 2010 during the outages at San Onofre and Four Corners.

•Higher operation and maintenance expense of $159 million including $75 million of increased energy efficiency program costs and $40 million related to the EdisonSmartConnectTM project.

•Higher depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense of $72 million including $35 million related to the EdisonSmartConnectTM project and $25 million related to the San Onofre steam generator replacement project.

2010 vs. 2009

Utility cost-recovery activities exclude the impact of the consolidation of the Big 4 projects in 2009 for comparability purposes. The following amounts were excluded for 2009: $370 million for purchased power expense to reflect the elimination of sales between the VIEs and SCE; $368 million for fuel expense; and $94 million for operation and maintenance expense. Utility cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by:

•Lower purchased power expense of $191 million primarily related to lower realized losses on economic hedging activities ($156 million in 2010 compared to $344 million in 2009) reflecting the impact of higher natural gas prices in 2010 and changes in SCE's hedge portfolio mix.

•Higher operation and maintenance expense of $71 million primarily due to an increase in spending for various public purpose programs.

Supplemental Operating Revenue Information

SCE's retail billed and unbilled revenue (excluding wholesale sales and balancing account over/undercollections) was $10.0 billion for both 2011 and 2010 and $9.5 billion for 2009. The 2011 revenue reflects:

•a rate decrease of $408 million resulting from a rate adjustment beginning on June 1, 2011, primarily reflecting the refund of over collected fuel and power procurement-related costs, offset by 

•a sales volume increase of $393 million primarily due to SCE providing power that was previously provided by CDWR contracts which expired in 2011.

The 2010 revenue reflects:

•a rate increase of $777 million mainly due to the implementation of the CPUC 2009 GRC decision and approved FERC transmission rate changes, partially offset by 

•a sales volume decrease of $255 million primarily due to milder weather experienced during 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and continuing recessionary effects. 

As a result of the CPUC-authorized decoupling mechanism, SCE earnings are not affected by changes in retail electricity sales (see "Item 1. Business—Overview of Ratemaking Process").

SCE remits to CDWR and does not recognize as revenue the amounts that SCE bills and collects from its customers for electric power purchased and sold by the CDWR to SCE's customers, as well as CDWR bond-related costs and a portion of direct access exit fees. The amounts collected and remitted to CDWR were $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion for years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. All CDWR power contracts allocated to SCE by the CPUC had expired by the end of 2011. SCE's revenue and related purchased power expense is expected to increase in 2012 as these CDWR contracts are replaced by new power purchase agreements entered into by SCE.

42
Effective January 1, 2010, the CDWR-related rates were decreased to reflect lower power procurement expenses and a refund of operating reserves that CDWR releases as its contracts terminate. Approximately $440 million is expected to be refunded to SCE customers through lower CDWR rates in 2012.

Income Taxes

The table below provides a reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the federal statutory income tax rate to the income tax provision.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in income taxes for property-related items was primarily due to a cumulative deferred income tax adjustment of $30 million in 2011 related to nuclear fuel.

For a discussion of the status of Edison International's income tax audits, see "Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes."

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SCE's ability to operate its business, fund capital expenditures, and implement its business strategy are dependent upon its cash flow and access to the capital markets. SCE's overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, interest and dividend payments to investors, and the outcome of tax and regulatory matters.

SCE expects to fund its 2012 obligations, capital expenditures and dividends through operating cash flows, tax benefits (including bonus depreciation) and capital market financings of debt and preferred equity, as needed. SCE also has availability under its credit facilities to meet operating and capital requirements.

In January and February 2012, SCE issued 250,000 shares and 100,000 shares, respectively, of 6.25% Series E preference 

43
stock (cumulative, $1,000 liquidation value). The Series E preference stock may not be redeemed prior to February 1, 2022. The proceeds from the sale of these shares were used to repay commercial paper borrowings issued to fund SCE's capital program.

Available Liquidity

SCE has two credit facilities: a $2.4 billion five-year credit facility that matures in February 2013 and a $500 million three-year credit facility that matures in March 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Debt Covenant

SCE has a debt covenant in its credit facilities that limits its debt to total capitalization ratio to less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2011, SCE's debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.48 to 1.

Capital Investment Plan

SCE's forecasted capital expenditures for 2012 – 2014 include a capital forecast in the range of $11.8 billion to $13.2 billion based on the average variability experienced in 2011, 2010 and 2009 of 11% between annual forecast capital expenditures and actual spending. This capital forecast includes certain projects under CPUC jurisdiction that are subject to the outcome of the 2012 CPUC GRC. The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, weather and other unforeseen conditions.

SCE's 2011 capital expenditures and the 2012 – 2014 capital expenditures forecast are set forth in the table below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Included in SCE's capital expenditures plan are projected environmental capital expenditures of $499 million, $534 million and $576 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The projected environmental capital expenditures are to comply with laws, regulations, and other nondiscretionary requirements.

44
Transmission Projects

SCE has experienced cost increases on its Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River Transmission Projects, primarily related to environmental monitoring and mitigation costs, scope changes and schedule delays. A summary of SCE's major transmission and substation projects during the next three years is presented below: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Direct expenditures include direct labor, land and contract costs incurred for the respective projects and exclude overhead costs that are included in the capital expenditures forecasted for 2012 – 2014.

Currently, SCE is completing the final engineering design for the Tehachapi Transmission and the Devers-Colorado River Projects and has increased its 2012 – 2014 forecasted expenditures for these projects as a result of cost pressures discussed above. The Tehachapi Project costs and schedule may be further impacted by the CPUC's response to SCE's petition to modify the 2009 decision approving the project for the purpose of obtaining authorization to install aviation marking and lighting in accordance with FAA standards. In October 2011, the CPUC staff notified SCE that the constructed portions of the project should be marked and lighted as required, but instructed SCE to defer completion of remaining project components that may require aviation marking or lighting pending CPUC review of the petition to modify. Community opposition to portions of the project continues and requests for reconsideration of the CPUC's 2009 decision are pending. In January 2012, in response to a CPUC request, SCE provided information on potential new options for a portion of the project, including traversing a state park, changing the nature of some of the towers, and undergrounding lines. Adoption of any of these alternatives could create additional costs and delay the completion of the project. SCE is required to file revised cost estimates with the CPUC. As with all transmission investments, cost recovery will be subject to future rate proceedings.

Distribution Projects

Distribution expenditures include projects and programs to meet customer load growth requirements, reliability and infrastructure replacement needs, information and other technology and related facility requirements.

Generation Projects

Generation expenditures include:

•Nuclear-related capital expenditures necessary to maintain safe and reliable plant operation, meet NRC and other regulatory requirements, and optimize plant performance and cost-effectiveness.

•Hydro-related capital expenditures associated with infrastructure and equipment replacement and renewal of FERC operating licenses. Infrastructure expenditures include dam improvements, flowline and substation refurbishments, and powerline replacements. Equipment replacement expenditures include transformers, automation, switchgear, hydro turbine repowers, generator rewinds, and small generator replacements.

•SCE's Solar Photovoltaic Program to develop up to 125 MW of utility owned Solar Photovoltaic generating facilities generally ranging in size from 1 to 2 MW each, on commercial and industrial rooftops and other space in SCE's service territory. The CPUC has authorized recovery of reasonable costs and allowed for a return on investment. 

EdisonSmartConnect™

SCE's EdisonSmartConnect™ project involves installing state-of-the-art "smart" meters in approximately 5 million households and small businesses through its service area. In March 2008, SCE was authorized by the CPUC to recover $1.63 billion in customer rates for the deployment phase of EdisonSmartConnect™. In 2009, SCE began full deployment of meters to all residential and small business customers under 200 kW. SCE anticipates completion of the deployment in 2012. In 2011, the CPUC began exploring the feasibility of allowing customers to voluntarily opt out of smart meter installation. 

45
SCE has provided information to the CPUC on the costs and technical issues involved. Should the CPUC order SCE to implement an opt out option, SCE would file an application seeking to recover the associated costs in rates.

Regulatory Proceedings

Energy Efficiency Shareholder Risk/Reward Incentive Mechanism 

The CPUC previously adopted and extended through 2009 an Energy Efficiency Risk/Reward Incentive Mechanism ("Energy Efficiency Mechanism") allowing SCE to earn incentives based on SCE's performance toward meeting CPUC energy efficiency goals. In December 2011, the CPUC issued a decision approving an $18 million final payment for 2009 performance under the Energy Efficiency Mechanism. The CPUC is reviewing and may further modify or eliminate the Energy Efficiency Mechanism for performance periods subsequent to 2009.

San Onofre Outage and Repair Issues

Four replacement steam generators were installed at San Onofre Units 2 and 3 in 2010 and 2011. Inspections of the Unit 2 steam generators during a planned maintenance and refueling outage in February 2012 found some isolated areas of wear in some of the 19,454 heat transfer tubes. In light of this condition, SCE, in consultation with the steam generators' manufacturer, determined that a number of the tubes should be removed from service as a preventive measure. The steam generators are designed to include sufficient tubes to accommodate a need to remove some from service for a variety of reasons, including wear, and the tubes that SCE is in the process of preventively removing from service in Unit 2 are well within the extra margin. Additionally, on January 31, 2012, a water leak was detected in one of the tubes of a new steam generator in Unit 3, and the Unit was safely taken offline. Extensive testing of the Unit 3 steam generators is ongoing to fully understand the cause of the leak. In a memorandum dated February 16, 2012, the NRC determined that inasmuch as the leak was in a newly installed steam generator, it will conduct an event follow-up baseline inspection to review San Onofre's response to the leak and verify the appropriateness of its remedial actions. Each Unit will be restarted when repairs on that Unit are completed, and SCE is satisfied that it is safe to do so.

The steam generators were supplied by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (“MHI”) and are warranted for an initial period of 20 years from acceptance. Subject to certain exceptions, the purchase agreement sets forth specified damages for certain repairs, generally limits MHI's aggregate contractual liability to the approximately $137 million purchase price of the generators and excludes consequential damages from recovery, such as the cost of replacement power. In 2005, the CPUC authorized expenditures of approximately $525 million ($665 million when adjusted for inflation) for SCE's 78.21% share of San Onofre to purchase and install new generators and remove their predecessors. Those expenditures remain subject to CPUC review upon submission of SCE's final costs for the overall project. SCE expects to file an application with the CPUC setting forth final project costs in the third or fourth quarter of 2012. Replacement power costs are recovered through the ERRA balancing account, subject to reasonableness review.

Dividend Restrictions

The CPUC regulates SCE's capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay Edison International. In SCE's most recent cost of capital proceeding, the CPUC set an authorized capital structure for SCE which included a common equity component of 48%. SCE may make distributions to Edison International as long as the common equity component of SCE's capital structure remains at or above the 48% authorized level on a 13-month weighted average basis. At December 31, 2011, SCE's 13-month weighted-average common equity component of total capitalization was 50.4% resulting in the capacity to pay $436 million in additional dividends.

During 2011, SCE made $461 million in dividend payments to its parent, Edison International. Future dividend amounts and timing of distributions are dependent upon several factors including the level of capital expenditures, operating cash flows and earnings.

Margin and Collateral Deposits

Certain derivative instruments, power procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements. Future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at December 31, 2011, due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on SCE's contractual obligations.

Some of the power procurement contracts contain provisions that require SCE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. If SCE's credit rating were to fall below investment grade, SCE may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral.

46
The table below provides the amount of collateral posted by SCE to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of December 31, 2011.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2 There would be no increase to SCE's total posted and potential collateral requirements based on SCE's forward positions as of December 31, 2011 due to adverse market price movements over the remaining lives of the existing power procurement contracts using a 95% confidence level.

Workers Compensation Self-Insurance Fund

SCE is self-insured for workers compensation claims. SCE assesses workers compensation claims that have been asserted and those that have been incurred but not reported to determine the probable amount of losses that should be recorded. The Department of Industrial Relations for the State of California requires companies that are self-insured for workers compensation to post collateral (in the form of cash and/or letters of credits) based on the estimated workers' compensation liability if a company's bond rating were to fall below "B." As of December 31, 2011, if SCE's bond rating were to fall below a "B" rating, SCE would be required to post $208 million for its workers compensation self-insurance plan.

Regulatory Balancing Accounts

SCE's cash flows are affected by regulatory balancing account over- or under-collections. Over- and under-collections represent differences between cash collected in current rates for specified forecasted costs and the costs actually incurred. With some exceptions, SCE seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis or at other designated times to recover or refund the balances recorded in its balancing account. Under- or over-collections in these balancing accounts impact cash flows and can change rapidly. Over- and under-collections accrue interest based on a three-month commercial paper rate published by the Federal Reserve.

As of December 31, 2011, balancing account net over-collections were $1.2 billion primarily related to public purpose-related program costs as well as fuel and power procurement-related costs. Over-collections for public purpose-related programs are expected to decrease as costs are incurred to fund programs established by the CPUC. The fuel and power procurement-related over-collections of $392 million are expected to be refunded through a rate adjustment in 2012.

Historical Segment Cash Flows

The table below sets forth condensed historical cash flow information for SCE:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $125 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following:

•$310 million decrease from refunding to customers overcollections of revenue which resulted from actual electricity sales exceeding forecasted electricity sales. SCE began refunding this balance through a rate adjustment effective June 1, 2011;

•$250 million decrease resulting from higher balancing account overcollections for fuel and power procurement-related 

47
costs in 2010 when compared to 2011 (overcollections of approximately $300 million in 2010 compared to approximately $50 million in 2011). The 2010 overcollection was primarily due to lower realized gas and power prices compared to the amounts forecasted for setting customer rates. SCE began refunding the overcollection through a rate adjustment beginning on June 1, 2011. The balancing account was over-collected by $392 million at December 31, 2011, $345 million at December 31, 2010, $46 million at December 31, 2009 and under-collected by $406 million at December 31, 2008; and

•$365 million increase resulting from higher income before depreciation and income taxes primarily driven by higher customer revenue.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $683 million in 2010, compared to 2009. The cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily due to the following:

•$531 million decrease in cash reflecting lower net tax receipts in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily related to the impacts of the Global Settlement. In 2009, SCE received tax-allocation payments of $875 million from the Global Settlement, compared to tax-allocation payments received of $26 million in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by higher estimated tax payments in 2009 compared to 2010.

•$155 million net cash inflow from balancing accounts composed of:

•$310 million net cash inflow from the funding of public purpose and solar initiative programs and lower pension and PBOP contributions in 2010 compared to 2009; and

•$155 million net cash outflow due to the decrease in balancing account cash flows for fuel and power procurement-related costs (collections of approximately $300 million in 2010, compared to collections of approximately $450 million in 2009).

•Timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to working capital items, including a net cash outflow of $95 million related to the timing of fuel and power procurement-related activities primarily related to ISO charges and a $60 million decrease in margin and collateral deposits – net of collateral received.

Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities

Cash provided (used) by financing activities mainly consisted of net repayments of short-term debt and long-term debt issuances (payments).

Net cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was $799 million consisting of the following significant events:

•Issued $500 million of 3.875% first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2021. The proceeds from these bonds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and to fund SCE's capital program.

•Issued a net $419 million of commercial paper supported by SCE's line of credit to fund interim working capital requirements.

•Issued $250 million of 3.9% first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2041. The proceeds from these bonds were used to fund SCE's capital program.

•Issued $150 million of floating rate first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2014. The proceeds from these bonds were used to finance fuel inventories.

•Issued $125 million of 6.5% Series D preference stock. The proceeds from the issuance were used to fund SCE's capital program.

•Paid $461 million of dividends to Edison International.

•Purchased $86 million of SCE variable rate tax-exempt bonds.

Net cash provided by financing activities for 2010 was $503 million consisting of the following significant events:

•Issued $1 billion of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2040 to fund SCE's capital program.

•Reissued $144 million of tax-exempt pollution control bonds due in 2035 to fund SCE's capital program.

•Repaid $250 million of senior unsecured notes.

48
•Paid $300 million in dividends to Edison International.

Net cash used by financing activities for 2009 was $2.0 billion consisting of the following significant events:

•Issued $500 million of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2039 and $250 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2014. The bond proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to finance fuel inventories, respectively.

•Repaid a net $1.9 billion of short-term debt.

•Repaid $150 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds.

•Purchased $219 million of two issues of tax-exempt pollution control bonds and converted the issues to a variable rate structure. As discussed above, SCE reissued $144 million of these bonds in 2010. SCE continues to hold the remaining $75 million of these bonds which are outstanding and have not been retired or cancelled.

•Paid $300 million in dividends to Edison International.

Net Cash Used by Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities are primarily due to capital expenditures and funding of nuclear decommissioning trusts. Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.0 billion for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily related to transmission, distribution and generation investments. Net purchases of nuclear decommissioning trust investments and other were $167 million, $219 million and $199 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies

Contractual Obligations

SCE's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, for the years 2012 through 2016 and thereafter are estimated below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." Amount includes interest payments totaling $8.0 billion over applicable period of the debt.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

49
3 At December 31, 2011, minimum other operating lease payments were primarily related to vehicles, office space and other equipment. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

4 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

5 At December 31, 2011, other commitments were primarily related to maintaining reliability and expanding SCE's transmission and distribution system. 

6 Amount includes estimated contributions to the pension and PBOP plans. The estimated contributions for SCE are not available beyond 2016. These amounts represent estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change. In addition, funding of future contributions could be impacted by the final 2012 GRC decision. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 8. Compensation and Benefit Plans" for further information.

7 At December 31, 2011, SCE had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $258 million, which is excluded from the table. SCE cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the IRS.

8 The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," respectively.

Contingencies

SCE has contingencies related to the CPSD Investigations, Four Corners New Source Review litigation, nuclear insurance, wildfire insurance and spent nuclear fuel, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies." 

Environmental Remediation

SCE records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and/or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated. SCE reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly, by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. These estimates include costs for site investigations, remediation, operations and maintenance, monitoring and site closure. Unless there is a probable amount, SCE records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs (classified as "Other long-term liabilities") at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2011, SCE had identified 24 material sites for remediation and recorded an estimated minimum liability of $49 million. SCE expects to recover 90% of its remediation costs at certain sites. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion.

MARKET RISK EXPOSURES

SCE's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and volumes, and counterparty credit. Fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows. Fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows, but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms. Derivative instruments are used, as appropriate, to manage market risks for customers and SCE. For a further discussion of SCE's market risk exposures, including commodity price risk, credit risk and interest rate risk, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and "—Note 4. Fair Value Measurements."

Interest Rate Risk

SCE is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short-term investing activities used for liquidity purposes, to fund business operations and to fund capital investments. The nature and amount of SCE's long-term and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Changes in interest rates may impact SCE's authorized rate of return for the period beyond 2012, see "Item 1. Business—Overview of Ratemaking Process—CPUC" for further discussion.

50
At December 31, 2011, the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) was $10.1 billion, compared to a carrying value of $8.4 billion. A 10% increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a $399 million decrease in the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt. A 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a $430 million increase in the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt.

Commodity Price Risk

SCE and its customers are exposed to the risk of a change in the market price of natural gas and electric power. SCE's hedging program reduces exposure to variability in market prices related to SCE's purchases and sales of electric power and natural gas. SCE expects recovery of its related hedging costs through the ERRA balancing account or CPUC-approved procurement plans, and as a result, exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings, but may impact the timing of cash flows. SCE's hedging program reduces customer exposure to variability in market prices. As part of this program, SCE enters into energy options, swaps, forward arrangements, tolling arrangements, and congestion revenue rights ("CRRs"). The transactions are pre-approved by the CPUC or executed in compliance with CPUC-approved procurement plans. For further discussion on derivative instruments entered into to mitigate commodity price exposures, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

With some exceptions, SCE records derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and, therefore, SCE's fair value changes have no impact on earnings. SCE does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment. For further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4. Fair Value Measurements."

The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used at SCE to mitigate its exposure to commodity price risk was a net liability of $936 million and $207 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in the net liability was related to changes in unrealized losses on economic hedging activities primarily due to declining power and natural gas prices. The following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2011, if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Credit Risk

For information related to credit risks and how SCE manages credit risk, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

Credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets (derivative assets less derivative liabilities) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. SCE enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff. Accordingly, SCE's credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements. SCE manages the credit risk on the portfolio for both rated and non-rated counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings, and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements. 

51
As of December 31, 2011, the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above broken down by the credit ratings of SCE's counterparties, was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 SCE assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty's S&P or Moody's rating. For ease of reference, the above table uses the S&P classifications to summarize risk, but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings.

2 Exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchases and sales and non-derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets, except for any related net accounts receivable.

3 The exposure in this category relates to long-term power purchase agreements. SCE's exposure is mitigated by regulatory treatment.

EDISON MISSION GROUP

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Continuing Operations

EMG primarily operates in one line of business, independent power production. The following table is a summary of competitive power generation results of operations for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 See use of Non-GAAP financial measures in "Edison International Overview—Highlights of Operating Results."

2 Includes termination of Edison Capital's cross-border leases and state tax impacts of Global Settlement with the IRS.

EMG had a core loss in 2011 compared to core earnings in 2010 primarily due to the following pre-tax items: 

•$206 million and $122 million decreases in Midwest Generation and Homer City income, respectively, primarily due to lower average realized energy and capacity prices and generation.

•$60 million increase in interest expense due to new energy project financings ($33 million) and lower capitalized interest ($27 million). 

•$36 million decrease in energy trading due to reduced revenues from trading power contracts and the allocation to Homer City of benefits from an arrangement that allows EMMT to deliver a portion of Homer City's power into the 

53
NYISO (such decrease resulting from that allocation is offset by revenues recognized at Homer City). 

•$18 million increase in renewable energy income due to the increase in wind projects in operation coupled with higher generation due to more favorable wind conditions, partially offset by lower realized energy prices at the merchant wind projects. 

Consolidated non-core items for 2011 and 2010 included:

•An after-tax earnings charge of $1.09 billion ($1.76 billion pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulting primarily from the impairment the Homer City, Fisk, Crawford and Waukegan power plants, wind related charges, write-down of a net investment in aircraft leases with American Airlines, and the impact on Edison International consolidated deferred income taxes resulting from an increase in the state apportionment rates due to such impairment charges as discussed in "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG" and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 16—Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

•An earnings benefit of $52 million in 2010 related to the acceptance by the California Franchise Tax Board of the tax positions finalized with the Internal Revenue Service in 2009 for the tax years 1986 through 2002 as part of the federal settlement of tax disputes and a revision to interest on federal disputed tax items. For more information, see "—Income Taxes" below.

•An after-tax earnings charge of $24 million ($40 million pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 resulting from the write-off of capitalized engineering and other costs related to a change in air emissions control technology selection at the Powerton Station.

54
Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) ("AOI")—Overview

The following table shows the adjusted operating income (loss) (AOI) of EMG's projects:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Effective April 1, 2011, EMMT allocated to Homer City the benefit of an arrangement that allows EMMT to deliver a portion of Homer City's power into the NYISO. To the extent this arrangement is not utilized, Homer City's power is delivered into PJM.

2 Primarily related to EMG's decision to reduce its development pipeline and ongoing development activities. For additional information, see "Edison International (Consolidated): Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Impairment of Long Lived Assets—Application to Selected EMG Wind Projects" in the MD&A and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

3 AOI is equal to operating income (loss) under GAAP, plus equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expenses, and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Production tax credits are recognized as wind energy is generated based on a per-kilowatt-hour rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. AOI is a non-GAAP performance measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expenses, and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in AOI is meaningful for investors as these components are integral to the operating results of EMG.

55
The following table reconciles AOI to operating income (loss) as reflected on EMG's consolidated statements of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted Operating Income from Consolidated Operations

Midwest Generation Plants

The following table presents additional data for the Midwest Generation plants:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Included in fuel costs were $3 million, $13 million and $63 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the net cost of emission allowances.

AOI from the Midwest Generation plants decreased $806 million in 2011 compared to 2010, and decreased $76 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 decrease in AOI, excluding the $640 million impairment charge previously discussed in "Edison International Overview—Highlights of Operating Results," was primarily attributable to lower energy and capacity revenues. The decline in energy revenues was due to lower average realized energy prices and lower generation due to the permanent shutdown of Will County Units 1 and 2 at the end of 2010 in accordance with the CPS. The decline in capacity revenues was due to lower capacity prices from the RPM auction. In addition, the change in AOI was impacted by a $40 million pre-tax charge in 2010 related to the write-off of capitalized engineering and other costs related to a change in air emissions control technology at the Powerton Station and a $24 million gain from the sale of bankruptcy claims against Lehman. The claims originated from power contracts that were terminated in 2008 due to the bankruptcy of Lehman. 

56
The 2010 decrease in AOI from 2009 was primarily attributable to unrealized losses in 2010 compared to unrealized gains in 2009 related to hedge contracts and an increase in plant maintenance costs, partially offset by higher capacity revenues and lower average realized fuel costs. Plant maintenance and overhaul related expenses were higher in 2010 due to the deferral of plant outages in 2009. Average realized fuel costs per megawatt-hour were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to lower emission allowance costs partially offset by higher costs for activated carbon, which is used to reduce mercury emissions. The write-off of capitalized costs at the Powerton Station and the gain from the sale of bankruptcy claims against Lehman also affected the comparison of results between these periods. 

Included in operating revenues were unrealized gains (losses) of $3 million, $(6) million and $30 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Unrealized gains (losses) were primarily attributable to economic hedge contracts that are accounted for at fair value with offsetting changes recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, $10 million and $14 million was reversed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to power contracts with Lehman that were dedesignated as cash flow hedges, subsequently terminated and recorded as unrealized losses in 2008. Unrealized gains (losses) also included the ineffective portion of hedge contracts at the Midwest Generation plants attributable to changes in the difference between energy prices at the Northern Illinois Hub (the settlement point under forward contracts) and the energy prices at the Midwest Generation plants' busbars (the delivery point where power generated by the Midwest Generation plants is delivered into the transmission system) resulting from marginal losses. 

Included in fuel costs were unrealized gains (losses) of $(4) million, $(7) million and $15 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to oil futures contracts that were accounted for as economic hedges. These contracts were entered into in 2010 and 2009 to hedge variable fuel oil components of rail transportation costs.

Homer City

The following table presents additional data for the Homer City plant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Effective April 1, 2011, EMMT allocated to Homer City the benefit of an arrangement that allows EMMT to deliver a portion of Homer City's power into the NYISO. To the extent this arrangement is not utilized, Homer City's power is delivered into PJM.

2 Included in fuel costs were $9 million, $7 million and $16 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the net cost of emission allowances.

AOI from the Homer City plant decreased $1.2 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 and decreased $72 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 decrease in AOI, excluding the $1.03 billion impairment charge previously discussed in "Edison International Overview—Highlights of Operating Results," was primarily attributable to lower energy revenues, driven by lower generation and average realized energy prices, lower capacity revenues, and higher plant maintenance costs from outages at Units 1 and 2, partially offset by unrealized gains in 2011 compared to unrealized losses in 2010 related to hedge contracts and lower fuel costs. The decline in fuel costs was primarily due to lower generation, mostly offset by higher coal costs. Coal costs increased due to higher coal prices. The Homer City plant continued to have a high forced outage rate during 2011 partially as a result of the steam pipe rupture on Unit 1 and the related precautionary maintenance on Unit 2. 

57
The 2010 decrease in AOI from 2009 was primarily attributable to unrealized losses in 2010 compared to unrealized gains in 2009 related to hedge contracts, higher coal costs, lower generation, and higher plant operations costs related to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by an increase in capacity revenues. The Homer City plant experienced increased forced outages in 2010 compared to 2009 due to deratings to comply with opacity restrictions and unscheduled outages. Plant maintenance and overhaul related expenses were higher in 2010 due to the deferral of plant outages in 2009. Coal costs increased due to higher coal prices and changes in the mix of ready-to-burn coal and raw coal consumed. 

Included in operating revenues were unrealized gains (losses) from hedge activities of $5 million, $(20) million and $15 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Unrealized gains (losses) were primarily attributable to the ineffective portion of hedge contracts at the Homer City plant attributable to changes in the difference between energy prices at the PJM West Hub (the settlement point under forward contracts) and the energy prices at the Homer City busbar (the delivery point where power generated by the Homer City plant is delivered into the transmission system). 

For additional discussion, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease."

Renewable Energy Projects

The following table presents additional data for EMG's renewable energy projects:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 AOI is equal to operating income (loss) under GAAP plus equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expense, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Production tax credits are recognized as wind energy is generated based upon a per-kilowatt-hour rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Under GAAP, production tax credits generated by wind projects are recorded as a reduction in income taxes. Accordingly, AOI represents a non-GAAP performance measure which may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of production tax credits in AOI for wind projects is meaningful for investors as federal and state subsidies are an integral part of the economics of these projects. 

2 Includes renewable energy projects that are unconsolidated at EMG. Generation excluding unconsolidated projects was 4,816 GWh in 2011, 3,037 GWh in 2010 and 2,514 GWh in 2009. 

AOI from renewable energy projects, excluding the $30 million impairment charge previously discussed in "Edison International Overview—Highlights of Operating Results," increased $18 million in 2011, and decreased $2 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 increase was primarily attributable to projects that achieved commercial operation in late 2010 and 2011 and increased generation at other projects due to favorable wind conditions during 2011, partially offset by lower realized prices from the merchant wind projects. EMG's share of installed capacity of new wind projects that commenced operations during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 295 MW, 150 MW and 223 MW, respectively.  

AOI in 2010 and 2009 included payments from Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation (Suzlon) for availability losses of 

58
$2 million and $17 million, respectively. Payments under the availability guarantee are designed to compensate EMG for lost earnings, including production tax credits. Accordingly, the payments under the availability guarantee are paid on a pre-tax basis which affects period-to-period comparisons that include production tax credits which are after tax. 

Energy Trading

AOI from energy trading activities decreased $36 million in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased $61 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 decrease was partially due to reduced revenues from power trading contracts in 2011 compared to 2010, partially offset by increased congestion revenues due to outages in the PJM markets. The decrease is also partially due to the allocation to Homer City of the benefit of an arrangement that allows EMMT to deliver a portion of Homer City's power into the NYISO. The 2010 increase in AOI energy trading activities was attributable to increased revenues in congestion and power trading. Congestion trading results increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to unseasonably cold weather and transmission outages in the New York and PJM markets.

Adjusted Operating Income from Leveraged Lease Activities and Lease Terminations and Other

AOI from leveraged lease income declined from 2009 as a result of the termination of cross border leases which resulted in a $920 million loss. This loss was partially offset by a $33 million gain in 2009 from the sale of an interest in a leveraged lease (Midlands Cogeneration Ventures). For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other."

Adjusted Operating Income from Other Projects

The CPUC-approved comprehensive settlement related to power sales from cogeneration facilities became effective in November 2011, and resulted in additional non-recurring adjusted operating income in 2011 totaling $11 million. 

Big 4 Projects. AOI from the Big 4 projects decreased $8 million in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased $6 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 decrease was primarily due to lower energy margins at Watson and lower contracted capacity under Midway-Sunset's new power purchase agreement, partially offset by additional revenues due to the settlement agreement discussed above. The 2010 increase was driven by changes in natural gas prices affecting steam revenues and plant maintenance.  

Westside Projects. AOI from the Westside projects increased $6 million in 2011 compared to 2010, and decreased $3 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 increase was primarily attributable to the new power purchase agreements, which became effective upon the settlement discussed above, and provided higher capacity prices retroactive to 2010. The 2010 decrease was primarily due to higher fuel and maintenance costs partially offset by higher revenues. 

Doga. The 2011 increase in AOI was due to higher distributions resulting primarily from the elimination of restricted cash as a result of the repayment of the remaining project debt. The 2010 increase was due to the timing of distributions. AOI is recognized when cash is distributed from the project as the Doga project is accounted for on the cost method. 

March Point. The 2011 income was due to the receipt of payment from the sale of the project. The 2010 AOI was primarily due to equity distributions received from the project prior to the sale of EMG ownership interest to its partner. 

Corporate Administrative and General Expenses

Corporate administrative and general expenses were lower during the past two years as EMG reduced development costs incurred pursuing renewable projects. 

Interest Income (Expense)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower average cash balances.

59
EMG's interest expense increased $60 million in 2011 from 2010 and decreased $42 million in 2010 from 2009. The 2011 increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher debt balances from new project financings and lower capitalized interest. The 2010 decrease in interest expense was primarily due to higher capitalized interest and lower debt balances under EME's and Midwest Generation's credit facilities, partially offset by higher wind project financing. Capitalized interest was $27 million, $54 million and $19 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 decrease was due to completion of the renewable energy projects under construction in 2010 and 2011. The 2010 increase was the result of increased interest capitalization for renewable energy projects under construction.

Income Taxes

The table below provides a reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the federal statutory income tax rate:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Not meaningful.

EMG's effective tax rate for 2011 was impacted by production tax credits and estimated state income tax benefits allocated from Edison International. The effective tax rate for 2010 was impacted by production tax credits and the Global Settlement. Estimated state income tax benefits allocated from Edison International of $6 million, $7 million and $15 million were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes."

Results of Discontinued Operations

The results of discontinued operations include foreign exchange gains and interest expense on contract indemnities denominated in euros, adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits, and expiration in 2010 of another contract indemnity. The contract indemnities relate to the sale of EMG's international projects in December 2004.

Related Party Transactions

EMG owns interests in partnerships that sell electricity generated by their project facilities to SCE and others under the terms of power purchase agreements. Sales by these partnerships to SCE under these agreements amounted to $277 million, $367 million and $366 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

60
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Available Liquidity

The following table summarizes available liquidity at December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Existing credit facilities mature in 2012. For further discussion, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG" in the MD&A and "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to EMG—Liquidity Risks." The EME credit facility was terminated subsequent to year end.

2 Cash and cash equivalents are available to meet Midwest Generation's operating and capital expenditure requirements.

EME, as a holding company, does not directly operate any revenue-producing generation facilities, EME relies on cash distributions and tax payments from its projects and tax benefits received under a tax-allocation agreement with Edison International to meet its obligations, including debt service obligations on long-term debt. The timing and amount of distributions from EME's subsidiaries may be restricted. For further details, including the current restrictions on distributions from the Homer City facility, see "—Debt Covenants and Dividend Restrictions—Dividend Restrictions in Major Financings."

The following table summarizes the status of the EME and Midwest Generation credit facilities, which mature in June 2012, at December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Senior notes in the principal amount of $500 million, which bear interest at 7.50% per annum, are due in June 2013. EME may from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchange offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on prevailing market conditions, EME's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

For information regarding EMG's plan to obtain third-party capital to finance the development of a portion of EMG's wind portfolio, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—EMG's Renewable Energy Activities" in the MD&A and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Variable Interest Entities—Categories of VIEs—Capistrano Wind Equity Capital-2012."

61
Capital Investment Plan

Forecasted capital expenditures through 2014 by EMG's subsidiaries for existing projects and corporate activities are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For additional information, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Midwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs."

Midwest Generation Capital Expenditures

Midwest Generation plants' projected environmental expenditures would retrofit Powerton Units 5 and 6, Joliet Units 7 and 8 and Will County Units 3 and 4, using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents and upgrading particulate removal systems to comply with CPS requirements for SO2 emissions and the US EPA's regulation on HAP emissions. Decisions regarding whether or not to proceed with retrofitting any particular remaining units to comply with CPS requirements for SO2 emissions, including those that have received permits, remain subject to a number of factors, such as market conditions, regulatory and legislative developments, and forecasted commodity prices and capital and operating costs applicable at the time decisions are required or made. Final decisions on whether to install controls, to install particular kinds of controls, and to actually expend capital or continue with the expenditure of capital will be made as required, subject to the requirements of the CPS and other applicable regulations. Furthermore, the timing of commencing capital projects may vary from the amounts set forth in the above table. For additional discussion, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Midwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs."

Plant capital expenditures for Midwest Generation includes capital projects for boiler and turbine controls, major boiler components and electrical systems.

Homer City Capital Expenditures

The capital investment plan set forth above does not include environmental capital expenditures to retrofit the Homer City plant because Homer City does not have the funds for retrofits and has not yet been able to raise capital needed for such retrofits. The funding of Homer City's environmental expenditures will be dependent on external funding. See "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease." Plant capital expenditures for Homer City are projected to be $39 million, $23 million, and $14 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. 

Walnut Creek Capital Expenditures

In July 2011, EME secured $495 million in construction and term financing for the Walnut Creek project. 

Renewable Energy Projects

Construction of the 80 MW Broken Bow I wind project commenced during the third quarter of 2011 and EME expects the 40 MW Crofton Bluffs wind project to commence construction in the second quarter of 2012. Commercial operations of the Broken Bow I and the Crofton Bluffs projects are expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.

On December 21, 2011, EMG closed a $242 million financing for a portfolio of three contracted wind projects representing 204 megawatts of generation capacity previously funded entirely with equity.

For information regarding third-party equity capital raised in February 2012 to finance the development of a portion of EMG's wind portfolio, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—EMG's Renewable Energy Activities" in the MD&A and "Item 8. Edison International and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Variable Interest Entities—Categories of VIEs—Capistrano Wind Equity Capital-2012."

62
During the fourth quarter of 2011, EMG significantly reduced its development activities to conserve cash and in light of more limited market opportunities. As a result, EMG reduced staffing and has undertaken efforts to reduce funding joint development projects, thereby reducing the development pipeline of potential wind projects to approximately 1,300 MW. Future development of the wind portfolio is dependent on the availability of third-party capital. To the extent that third-party capital is available, the success of development efforts will depend upon, among other things, obtaining permits and agreements necessary to support an investment.

Historical Segment Cash Flows

The table below sets forth condensed historical cash flow information for EMG.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $356 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a $253 million deposit paid by Edison Capital to the IRS in 2010 related to Global Settlement and an increase in U.S. Treasury grants received by EME, partially offset by a decrease in operating income at EME due to declining energy prices, increasing operating costs, and higher interest payments due to new energy project financings.

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $1.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the impacts of the Global Settlement. In April 2010, Edison Capital funded a $253 million deposit to the IRS related to the Global Settlement. In 2009, Edison Capital made a net tax-allocation payment to Edison International of $1.1 billion related to the termination of Edison Capital's interest in cross-border leases (see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes" for further discussion). The 2010 increase was also due to higher realized revenue from derivative contracts and payments on U.S. Treasury grants.

Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations decreased $59 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher repayment of credit facilities by EME in 2011, partially offset by Edison Capital redeeming $89 million of its medium-term loans in 2010.

Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased $1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, financing activities included project-level financing of renewable energy projects and repayment of credit facilities in 2009.

Net Cash Used by Investing Activities

Cash used by investing activities from continuing operations decreased $58 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the timing of construction of EME's wind projects.

Cash used by investing activities from continuing operations decreased $1.6 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2010 decrease was primarily due to $1.385 billion of net proceeds from termination of the cross-border leases at Edison Capital in 2009. The change was also due to the construction of wind projects.

63
Credit Ratings

Credit ratings for EME, Midwest Generation and EMMT as of December 31, 2011 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Senior unsecured rating.

2 First priority senior secured rating.

All the above ratings are on negative outlook. EMG cannot provide assurance that its current credit ratings or the credit ratings of its subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered. EMG notes that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold its securities and may be revised at any time by a rating agency.

EMG does not have any "rating triggers" contained in subsidiary financings that would result in a requirement to make equity contributions or provide additional financial support to its subsidiaries, including EMMT. However, coal contracts at Midwest Generation include provisions that provide the right to request additional collateral to support payment obligations for delivered coal and may vary based on Midwest Generation's credit ratings. Furthermore, EMMT also has hedge contracts that do not require margin, but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party.

Margin, Collateral Deposits and Other Credit Support for Energy Contracts

To reduce its exposure to market risk, EMG hedges a portion of its electricity price exposure through EMMT. In connection with entering into contracts, EMMT may be required to support its risk of nonperformance through parent guarantees, margining or other credit support. EME has entered into guarantees in support of EMMT's hedging and trading activities. However, EME has historically also provided collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties. For further details, see "Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

Future cash collateral requirements may be higher than the margin and collateral requirements at December 31, 2011, if wholesale energy prices change or if EMMT enters into additional transactions. EMG estimates that margin and collateral requirements for energy and congestion contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2011 could increase by approximately $34 million over the remaining life of the contracts using a 95% confidence level.

Intercompany Tax-Allocation Agreement

EMG and its subsidiaries, EME and Edison Capital, are included in the consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns of Edison International and are eligible to participate in tax-allocation payments with other subsidiaries of Edison International in circumstances where domestic tax losses are incurred. The right of EME and Edison Capital to receive and the amount of and timing of tax-allocation payments are dependent on the inclusion of EME and Edison Capital in the consolidated income tax returns of Edison International and its subsidiaries and other factors, including the consolidated taxable income of Edison International and its subsidiaries, the amount of net operating losses and other tax items of EMG's subsidiaries, and other subsidiaries of Edison International and specific procedures regarding allocation of state taxes. EMG received net tax-allocation payments of $241 million in 2011 and made net tax-allocation payments of $371 million and $1.1 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. EMG expects to make tax-allocation payments to Edison International during 2012 of approximately $185 million as a result of the reallocation of tax obligations from an expected Edison International consolidated net operating loss in 2011.

Debt Covenants and Dividend Restrictions

Dividend Restrictions in Major Financings

Each of EMG's direct or indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from EMG and its other subsidiaries. Except for certain of EMG's wind projects in portfolio financings, assets of EMG's subsidiaries are not available to satisfy EMG's obligations or the obligations of any of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that 

64
are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law and the terms of financing arrangements of the parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to EMG or to its subsidiary holding companies.

Key Ratios of EMG's Principal Subsidiaries Affecting Dividends

Set forth below are key ratios of EMG's principal subsidiaries required by financing arrangements at December 31, 2011 or for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As indicated above, the actual senior rent service coverage ratio of Homer City was below the covenant threshold for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, and Homer City also did not meet the threshold for the prospective two 12-month periods, which currently precludes Homer City from making distributions, including repayment of certain intercompany loans and from paying the equity portion of the rent payment. For additional information, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease."

Midwest Generation Financing Restrictions on Distributions

Midwest Generation is bound by the covenants in its credit agreement and certain covenants under the Powerton-Joliet lease documents with respect to Midwest Generation making payments under the leases. These covenants include restrictions on the ability to, among other things, incur debt, create liens on its property, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, make distributions, make capital expenditures, enter into agreements restricting its ability to make distributions, engage in other lines of business, enter into swap agreements, or engage in transactions for any speculative purpose. In order for Midwest Generation to make a distribution, it must be in compliance with the covenants specified under its credit agreement, including maintaining a debt-to-capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.60 to 1.

Homer City Sale-Leaseback Restrictions on Distributions

Homer City completed a sale-leaseback of the Homer City plant in December 2001. In order to make a distribution, Homer City must be in compliance with the covenants specified in the lease agreements, including the following financial performance requirements measured on the date of distribution.

At the end of each quarter, the equity and debt portions of rent then due and payable must have been paid and the senior rent service coverage ratio for the prior 12-month period (taken as a whole and projected for each of the prospective two 12-month periods) must be greater than 1.7 to 1 in order to make the equity portion of the rent payment and other restricted payments. Homer City would be permanently restricted in its ability to make distributions if a failure to pay equity rent when due was not cured within nine months, or even if cured, occurred more than one additional time during the term of the lease. EME has not guaranteed Homer City's obligations under the leases. Homer City believes it is unlikely to meet the covenant requirements of its sale-leaseback agreements relating to the payment of equity rent at April 1, 2012, and will be unable to make the required equity rent payment. There is no assurance that subsequent rent payments will be made. For additional information, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease."

EME's Senior Notes and Guaranty of Powerton-Joliet Leases

EME is restricted under applicable agreements from selling or disposing of assets, which includes distributions, if the aggregate net book value of all such sales and dispositions during the most recent 12-month period would exceed 10% of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in such agreements computed as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter preceding the sale or disposition in question. At December 31, 2011, the maximum permissible sale or disposition of EME assets was $778 million.

This limitation does not apply if the proceeds are invested in assets in similar or related lines of business of EME. Furthermore, EME may sell or otherwise dispose of assets in excess of such 10% limitation if the proceeds from such sales or dispositions, which are not reinvested as provided above, are retained as cash or cash equivalents or are used to repay debt.

65
Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies

Contractual Obligations

EMG has contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements. The following table summarizes EMG's significant consolidated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." Amount also includes interest payments totaling $2.1 billion over the applicable period of the debt. 

2 At December 31, 2011, minimum operating lease payments were primarily related to long-term leases for the Powerton and Joliet Stations and the Homer City plant. For further discussion, see "—Off-Balance Sheet Transactions—Sale-Leaseback Transactions" and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

3 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

4 Years subsequent to 2012 represent contracts for minimum volumes without regard to payment of alternative liquidated damages or plant closures.

5 Amount includes estimated contribution for pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions. The estimated contributions beyond 2016 are not available. For more information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 8. Compensation and Benefit Plans—Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

7 The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and AROs, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," respectively.

Commercial Commitments

Standby Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2011, standby letters of credit under EMG and its subsidiaries' credit facilities aggregated $177 million and were scheduled to expire as follows: $146 million in 2012 and $3 million in 2013, $10 million in 2017, and $18 million in 2018. Certain letters of credit are subject to automatic annual renewal provisions.

66
Contingencies

EMG has contingencies related to the Midwest Generation NSR and other litigation, Homer City NSR and other litigation, and environmental remediation which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions

EMG has off-balance sheet transactions in three principal areas: investments in projects accounted for under the equity method, operating leases resulting from sale-leaseback transactions and leveraged leases.

Investments Accounted for under the Equity Method

EMG has a number of investments in power projects that are accounted for under the equity method. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Variable Interest Entities."

Subsidiaries of EMG have invested in affordable housing projects utilizing partnership or limited liability companies in which EMG is a passive investor. With a few exceptions, an unrelated general partner or managing member exercises operating control of these projects and partnerships. The debt of those partnerships and limited liability companies is secured by real property. At December 31, 2011, entities that EMG has accounted for under the equity method had indebtedness of approximately $1.2 billion, of which approximately $318 million is proportionate to EMG's ownership interest in these projects. Substantially all of this debt is nonrecourse to EMG.

Sale-Leaseback Transactions

EMG has entered into sale-leaseback transactions related to the Powerton Station and Units 7 and 8 of the Joliet Station in Illinois and the Homer City plant in Pennsylvania. For further discussion, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease" and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Power Plant and Other Lease Commitments."

The lessor equity and lessor debt associated with the sale-leaseback transactions for the Powerton, Joliet and Homer City assets are summarized in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PSEG – PSEG Resources, Inc.

GECC – General Electric Capital Corporation

The operating lease payments to be made by each of EMG's subsidiary lessees are structured to service the lessor debt and provide a return to the owner-lessor's equity investors. Neither the value of the leased assets nor the lessor debt is reflected on EMG's consolidated balance sheet.

MARKET RISK EXPOSURES

Introduction

EMG's primary market risk exposures are associated with the sale of electricity and capacity from, and the procurement of fuel for, its merchant power plants. These market risks arise from price fluctuations of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. Additionally, EMG's financial results can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates. EMG manages these risks in part by using derivative instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures.

Derivative Instruments

EMG uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from price fluctuations of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. For derivative instruments recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings at the end of each accounting period unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. 

67
For derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, changes in their fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item settles and is recognized in earnings. However, the ineffective portion of a derivative that qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting is recognized currently in earnings.

Unrealized Gains and Losses

EMG classifies unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments (other than the effective portion of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting) as part of operating revenues or fuel costs. The following table summarizes unrealized gains (losses) from non-trading activities:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2011, cumulative unrealized gains of $7 million were recognized from non-qualifying hedge contracts or the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges related to 2012.

Fair Value Disclosures

In determining the fair value of EMG's derivative positions, EMG uses third-party market pricing where available. For further explanation of the fair value hierarchy and a discussion of EMG's derivative instruments, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4. Fair Value Measurements" and "—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," respectively.

The net fair value of commodity derivatives used for non-trading purposes at December 31, 2011 was $42 million. A 10% change in the market price of the underlying commodity at December 31, 2011 would increase or decrease the net fair value of non-trading commodity derivatives by approximately $26 million.

The net fair value of derivatives used for trading purposes at December 31, 2011 was $107 million. A 10% change in the market price of the underlying commodity at December 31, 2011 would increase or decrease the net fair value of trading contracts by approximately $19 million. The impact of changes to the various inputs used to determine the fair value of Level 3 derivatives would not be anticipated to be material to EME's results of operations as such changes would be offset by similar changes in derivatives classified within Level 3 as well as other levels. Level 3 assets and liabilities are 56% and 11%, respectively, of derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value before the impact of offsetting collateral and netting as of December 31, 2011.

Commodity Price Risk

Introduction

EMG's merchant operations are exposed to commodity price risk, which reflects the potential impact of a change in the market value of a particular commodity. Commodity price risks are actively monitored, with oversight provided by a risk management committee, to ensure compliance with EMG's risk management policies. Despite this, there can be no assurance that all risks have been accurately identified, measured and/or mitigated.

Energy Price Risk

Energy and capacity from the coal plants are sold under terms, including price, duration and quantity, arranged by EMMT with customers through a combination of bilateral agreements (resulting from negotiations or from auctions), forward energy sales and spot market sales. Power is sold into PJM at spot prices based upon locational marginal pricing. Energy from 428 MW of merchant renewable energy projects is sold in the energy markets, primarily at spot prices in PJM and ERCOT.

68
The following table depicts the average historical market prices for energy per megawatt-hour at the locations indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Energy prices were calculated at the Northern Illinois Hub and Homer City Busbar delivery points and the PJM West Hub using historical hourly day-ahead prices as published by PJM or provided on the PJM web-site.

The following table sets forth the forward market prices for energy per megawatt-hour as quoted for sales into the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub at December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Energy prices were determined by obtaining broker quotes and information from other public sources relating to the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub delivery points.

2 Market price for energy purchases for the entire calendar year.

Power prices at the Northern Illinois Hub fell in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continued to fall in 2012 due to an abundance of low-priced natural gas and the sales volume from the Midwest Generation plants has been correspondingly affected. Forward market prices at the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including natural gas prices, transmission congestion, changes in market rules, electricity demand (which in turn is affected by weather, economic growth, and other factors), plant outages in the region, and the amount of existing and planned power plant capacity. The actual spot prices for electricity delivered by the coal plants into these markets may vary materially from the forward market prices set forth in the preceding table.

69
EMMT engages in hedging activities for the coal plants to hedge the risk of future change in the price of electricity. The following table summarizes the hedge positions (including load requirements services contracts and forward contracts accounted for on the accrual basis) as of December 31, 2011 for electricity expected to be generated in 2012 and 2013:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day. Market prices tend to be higher during on-peak periods and during summer months, although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time. Accordingly, the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the 24-hour Northern Illinois Hub or PJM West Hub prices set forth above.

2 Includes hedging transactions primarily at the Northern Illinois Hub and to a lesser extent the AEP/Dayton Hub, both in PJM, and the Indiana Hub in MISO.

3 Includes hedging transactions primarily at the PJM West Hub and to a lesser extent at other trading locations. 2012 includes hedging activities entered into by EMMT for the Homer City plant that are not designated under the intercompany agreements with Homer City due to limitations under the sale- leaseback transaction documents.

4 The average price/MWh includes 172 MW of capacity for periods ranging from January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2012 at Homer City sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts.

In January 2012, EMMT entered into 14.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas futures contracts (equivalent to approximately 1,610 GWh of energy only contracts using a ratio of 9.12 MMBtu to 1 MWh) for the Midwest Generation plants to economically hedge energy price risks through December 2012 at an average price of $24.88/MWh. 

Capacity Price Risk

Under the RPM, capacity commitments are made in advance to provide a long-term pricing signal for construction of capacity resources. 

70
The following table summarizes the status of capacity sales for Midwest Generation and Homer City at December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Capacity not sold arises from: (i) capacity retained to meet forced outages under the RPM auction guidelines, and (ii) capacity that PJM does not purchase at the clearing price resulting from the RPM auction.

2 Excludes 172 MW of capacity for periods ranging from January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2012 at Homer City sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts.

3 Other capacity sales and purchases, net includes contracts executed in advance of the RPM base residual auction to hedge the price risk related to such auction, participation in RPM incremental auctions and other capacity transactions entered into to manage capacity risks.

4 Includes the impact of a 100 MW capacity swap transaction executed prior to the base residual auction at $135 per MW-day.

The RPM auction capacity prices for the delivery period of June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 and June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014 varied between different areas of PJM. In the western portion of PJM, affecting Midwest Generation, the prices of $16.46 per MW-day and $27.73 per MW-day were substantially lower than other areas' capacity prices. The impact of lower capacity prices for these periods compared to previous years will have an adverse effect on Midwest Generation's revenues unless such lower capacity prices are offset by an unavailability of competing resources and increased energy prices.

Revenues from the sale of capacity from Midwest Generation and Homer City beyond the periods set forth above will depend upon the amount of capacity available and future market prices either in PJM or nearby markets if EME has an opportunity to capture a higher value associated with those markets. 

For additional information regarding capacity sold by Homer City, see "Edison International Overview—Management Overview of EMG—Homer City Lease."

Basis Risk

Sales made from the coal plants in the real-time or day-ahead market receive the actual real-time or day-ahead prices, as the case may be, at the busbars (delivery points) of the individual plants. In order to mitigate price risk from changes in forward spot prices at the individual plant busbars, EMG may enter into cash settled futures contracts as well as forward contracts with counterparties for energy to be delivered in future periods. Currently, a liquid market for entering into these contracts at the individual plant busbars does not exist. A liquid market does exist for a settlement point at the PJM West Hub in the case of the Homer City plant and for settlement points at the Northern Illinois Hub and the AEP/Dayton and Indiana Hubs in the case of the Midwest Generation plants. EMG's hedging activities use these settlement points (and, to a lesser extent, other 

71
similar trading hubs) to enter into hedging contracts. To the extent that, on the settlement date of a hedge contract, spot prices at the relevant busbar are lower than spot prices at the settlement point, the proceeds actually realized from the related hedge contract are effectively reduced by the difference. This is referred to as "basis risk." During 2011, day-ahead prices at the Homer City busbar were lower than those at the PJM West Hub by an average of 9%, compared to 16% during 2010 and 12% during 2009, due to transmission congestion in PJM. During 2011, day-ahead prices at the individual busbars of the Midwest Generation plants were lower than the AEP/Dayton Hub, Cinergy Hub and Northern Illinois Hub by an average of 14%, 4% and less than 1%, respectively, compared to 13%, 6% and less than 1%, respectively, during 2010, due to transmission congestion in PJM.

In order to mitigate basis risk, EMG may purchase financial transmission rights and basis swaps in PJM for Homer City and Midwest Generation. A financial transmission right is a financial instrument that entitles the holder to receive the difference between actual day-ahead prices for two delivery points in exchange for a fixed amount.

Coal and Transportation Price Risk

The Midwest Generation plants and Homer City plant purchase coal primarily from the Southern PRB of Wyoming and from mines located near the facilities in Pennsylvania, respectively. Coal purchases are made under a variety of supply agreements. The following table summarizes the amount of coal under contract at December 31, 2011 for the following three years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The amount of coal under contract in equivalent tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an 8,800 Btu equivalent for the Midwest Generation plants and 13,000 Btu equivalent for the Homer City plant.

EMG is subject to price risk for purchases of coal that are not under contract. Market prices of NAPP coal, which are related to the price of coal purchased for the Homer City plant, increased during the past two years. The market price of NAPP coal based on 13,000 Btu per pound heat content and <3.0 pounds of SO2 per MMBtu sulfur content was $73.30 per ton at December 30, 2011, compared to a price of $70 per ton and $52.50 per ton at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as reported by the EIA. In 2011, the price of NAPP coal ranged from $70 per ton to $78.20 per ton, as reported by the EIA. The 2011 increase in NAPP coal prices was primarily driven by the export market demand and global coal pricing. 

Market prices of PRB coal based on 8,800 Btu per pound heat content and 0.8 pounds of SO2 per MMBtu sulfur content fluctuated between $12.35 per ton and $15.10 per ton during 2011, as reported by EIA. The December 30, 2011 price of $12.75 per ton compared to a price of $13.60 per ton and $9.25 per ton at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as reported by the EIA. The 2011 fluctuations in PRB coal prices were in line with normal market price volatility with the higher PRB prices reflecting the impact of the CSAPR before it was stayed. 

Midwest Generation contracts with rail carriers to transport coal to its facilities. In anticipation of the expiration on December 31, 2011 of its existing rail transportation contracts, during the fourth quarter of 2011, Midwest Generation entered into new multi-year transportation contracts with Union Pacific Railroad and two short-haul carriers for a specified minimum and maximum amount of tons effective January 1, 2012. The estimated minimum annual costs of transportation of coal under these contracts, based on tonnage commitments, are $386 million during 2012, $326 million in 2013, and $333 million in 2014. However, all of the contracts have provisions that address the financial exposure of Midwest Generation related to a plant closure under certain circumstances as specified in the agreements. The contracts provide for quarterly and annual cost adjustments based on a number of factors that may increase the minimum payments. 

EMG believes Midwest Generation is fully contracted in 2012 based on its anticipated coal requirements for Midwest Generation. Based on Homer City's anticipated coal requirements in excess of the amount under contract, Homer City expects that a 10% change in the price of coal at December 31, 2011 would increase or decrease 2012 pre-tax income by approximately $4 million. 

Emission Allowances Price Risk

If CSAPR becomes effective as issued, the amount of SO2 that a plant emits in its operation will need to be matched by a sufficient amount of SO2 allowances designated under this program (CSAPR SO2 allowances) that are either allocated to the 

72
plant under the CSAPR program or purchased in the open market. SO2 allowances under the federal Acid Rain Program cannot be used to satisfy the requirements under CSAPR. For additional information on CSAPR, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Environmental Developments—Cross-State Air Pollution Rule."

Credit Risk

For further information related to credit risk and how EMG manages credit risk, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

The credit risk exposure from counterparties of merchant energy hedging and trading activities is measured as the sum of net receivables (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets. EMG's subsidiaries enter into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting such activities which typically provide for a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty. At December 31, 2011, the balance sheet exposure as described above, by the credit ratings of EMG's counterparties, was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 EMG assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty's S&P or Moody's rating. For ease of reference, the above table uses the S&P classifications to summarize risk, but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings.

2 Exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non-derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, except for any related accounts receivable.

The credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is composed of $82 million of net accounts receivable and payables and $88 million representing the fair value of derivative contracts. The exposure is based on master netting agreements with the related counterparties. Credit ratings may not be reflective of the actual related credit risks. In addition to the amounts set forth in the above table, EMG's subsidiaries have posted a $41 million cash margin in the aggregate with PJM, NYISO, MISO, clearing brokers and other counterparties to support hedging and trading activities. The margin posted to support these activities also exposes EMG to credit risk of the related entities.

The coal plants sell electric power generally into the PJM market by participating in PJM's capacity and energy markets or transacting in capacity and energy on a bilateral basis. Sales into PJM accounted for approximately 69% of EMG's consolidated operating revenues in 2011. At December 31, 2011, EMG's account receivable due from PJM was $62 million.

EMG's wind turbine supply agreements contain significant suppliers' obligations related to the manufacturing and delivery of turbines, and payments, for delays in delivery and for failure to meet performance obligations and warranty agreements. EMG's reliance on these contractual provisions is subject to credit risks. Generally, these are unsecured obligations of the turbine manufacturer. A material adverse development with respect to EMG's turbine suppliers may have a material impact on EMG's wind projects and development efforts.

73
Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate changes can affect earnings and the cost of capital for capital improvements or new investments in power projects. EMG mitigates the risk of interest rate fluctuations by arranging for fixed rate financing or variable rate financing with interest rate swaps, interest rate options or other hedging mechanisms for a number of its project financings. A 10% change in market interest rates at December 31, 2011 would increase or decrease the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements by approximately $21 million. The fair market values of fixed interest rate obligations are subject to interest rate risk. The fair market value of EMG's consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was $3.7 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to the carrying value of $4.9 billion. A 10% increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2011 would result in a decrease in the fair value of total long-term debt by approximately $155 million. A 10% decrease in market interest rates at December 31, 2011 would result in an increase in the fair value of total long-term debt by approximately $172 million.

74
EDISON INTERNATIONAL PARENT AND OTHER

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of operations for Edison International Parent and Other includes amounts from other Edison International subsidiaries that are not significant as a reportable segment, as well as intercompany eliminations.

Edison International Parent and Other earnings (loss) from continuing operations were $(33) million, $(8) million and $18 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income tax benefits in 2011 included a cumulative deferred tax adjustment related to employee benefits and a consolidated tax expense (benefit) of $7 million, $(25) million and $(42) million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively, representing differences in the allocation of state income taxes to subsidiaries under tax allocation agreements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Edison International Parent liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and dividends to common shareholders is dependent on dividends from SCE, tax-allocation payments under its tax-allocation agreements with its subsidiaries, and access to bank and capital markets.

At December 31, 2011, Edison International (parent) had approximately $28 million of cash and equivalents on hand. Edison International (parent) has a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility with various banks that terminates in February 2013. The following table summarizes the status of the Edison International (parent) credit facility at December 31, 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Edison International has a debt covenant in its credit facility that requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2011, Edison International's consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.56 to 1.

Historical Segment Cash Flows

The table below sets forth condensed historical cash flow information for Edison International Parent and Other.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Cash Used by Operating Activities

Net cash used by operating activities primarily relate to interest, operating costs and income taxes of Edison International (parent). During 2010, Edison International received $134 million in state tax refunds related to Global Settlement and made tax-allocation payments to SCE of $295 million, resulting in a use of operating cash flows. Edison International funded a portion of the 2010 tax-allocation payments due by Edison Capital in consideration for repayment of intercompany loans.

See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes" for further discussion of the Global Settlement.

Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities

Financing activities for 2011 were as follows:

•Paid $417 million of dividends to Edison International common shareholders.

75
•Received $461 million of dividend payments from SCE.

Financing activities for 2010 were as follows:

•Issued $400 million of senior notes due in 2017. The proceeds from these bonds were used to repay short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the remainder for corporate liquidity purposes.

•Paid $411 million of dividends to Edison International common shareholders.

•Received $300 million of dividend payments from SCE.

•Repaid a net $66 million of short-term debt.

Financing activities for 2009 were as follows:

•Paid $404 million of dividends to Edison International common shareholders.

•Repaid a net $165 million of short-term debt, primarily due to the improvement in economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008.

•Received $300 million of dividend payments from SCE.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2011, Edison International Parent and Other had outstanding debt of $400 million which matures in 2017. Interest in the amount of $15 million is payable annually in years 2012 through 2016 and $10.3 million is due in 2017.

MARKET RISK EXPOSURES

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2011, the fair market value of Edison International Parent and Other's long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) was $416 million, compared to a carrying value of $399 million. A 10% increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a $6 million decrease in the fair market value of the long-term debt. A 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a $6 million increase in the fair market value of the long-term debt.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL (CONSOLIDATED)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Contractual Obligations

Edison International's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, for the years 2012 through 2016 and thereafter are estimated below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." Amount includes interest payments totaling $10.2 billion over applicable period of the debt.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

3 At December 31, 2011, minimum operating lease payments were primarily related to long-term leases for the Powerton and Joliet stations and Homer City facilities and vehicles, office space and other equipment. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

4 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."

5 Years subsequent to 2012 represent contracts for minimum volumes without regard to payment of alternative liquidated damages or plant closures.

6 For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies." In addition, at December 31, 2011, other commitments also related to maintaining reliability and expanding SCE's transmission and distribution system. 

7 Amount includes estimated contributions to the pension and PBOP plans for Edison International through 2016. The estimated contributions are not available beyond 2016. These amounts represent estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change. In addition, funding of future contributions for SCE could be impacted by the final 2012 GRC decision. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 8. Compensation and Benefit Plans" for further information.

77
8 At December 31, 2011, Edison International had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $479 million, which is excluded from the table. Edison International cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the IRS.

9 The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment," respectively.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies

The accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of Edison International's consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or, the use of alternative estimates, that could have a material impact on Edison International's results of operations or financial position. For more information on Edison

International's accounting policies, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

Rate Regulated Enterprises

Nature of Estimate Required. SCE follows the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue, these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates; conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred.

Key Assumptions and Approach Used. SCE's management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to SCE or other rate-regulated entities in California, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. Using these factors, management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement. This determination reflects the current regulatory climate in California and is subject to change in the future.

Effect if Different Assumption Used. Significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund, as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings. At December 31, 2011, the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of $6.0 billion and regulatory liabilities of $5.3 billion. If different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition, SCE's earnings may vary from the amounts reported.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Nature of Estimates Required. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance. Authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company's assets or group of assets (without interest charges) is less than its carrying value, asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements. The impairment charges, if applicable, are calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or, in the case of assets expected to be sold, at fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators exist or when there is a commitment to sell or dispose of the asset. These evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as economic or operational analyses.

Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine: (1) if an indicator of impairment has occurred, (2) how assets should be grouped, (3) the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset's estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists, and (4) if an impairment 

78
exists, the fair value of the asset or asset group. Factors that are considered important, which could trigger an impairment, include operating losses from a project, projected future operating losses, the financial condition of counterparties, or significant negative industry or economic trends. The determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in: (1) estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices that are susceptible to significant change, (2) environmental and maintenance expenditures, and (3) the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives.

In preparing long-term cash forecasts, EMG includes assumptions about future prices for electricity, capacity, fuel and related products and services, as applicable, future operations and maintenance costs and future capital expenditure requirements under different scenarios. As appropriate, EME uses a probability weighted approach when determining whether impairment indicators exist. Assumptions included in the long-term cash flow forecasts for merchant projects include:

•Observable market prices for electricity, fuel and related products and services to the extent available and long-term prices developed based on a fundamental price model;

•Long-term capacity prices based on the assumption that capacity markets would continue consistent with their current structure, with expected increases in revenues as a result of declines in reserve margins beyond the price of the latest auctions;

•Trends for additions and retirements for generation resources; and

•Plans for compliance with both existing and possible future environmental regulations.

EMG includes allocated acquired emission allowances as part of each power plant asset group. In the case of the Powerton and Joliet Stations and Homer City, EMG also includes prepaid rent in the respective asset group. EMG's unit of account is at the plant level and, accordingly, the closure of a unit at a multi-unit site would not result in an impairment of property, plant and equipment unless such condition were to affect an impairment assessment on the entire plant.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues, environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures.

Application to EMG's Homer City Plant

As described in "Management Overview of EMG," Homer City failed to obtain sufficient interest from market participants to fund the capital improvements during the process undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2011, and Homer City is currently engaged in discussions with the owner-lessors regarding the potential for such funding. EMG expects that the outcome of any such discussions, if successful in providing funding for the Homer City plant, will likely result in EMG's loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the Homer City plant. Failure to resolve the source of funding of necessary capital expenditures for the Homer City plant could result in Homer City's default under the lease agreements giving rise to remedies for the owner-lessors and secured lease obligation bondholders, which could include foreclosing on the leased assets, the general partner of Homer City, or both. In connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements, EMG concluded that these events combined with the current and projected financial condition of Homer City were indicators of impairment. The long-lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include the Homer City lease, leasehold improvements and prepaid rent. In assessing impairment, EMG concluded that the future undiscounted cash flows through the period in which EMG expects to continue to have significant economic interest and control of the Homer City plant were insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset group. To measure the amount of impairment loss, the market and income approaches were considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. EMG viewed the lack of interest from market participants to provide sufficient funding for the capital improvements as indicative that the fair value of the asset group is zero. Furthermore, discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future energy, capacity and coal prices, operations and maintenance costs and operating lease payments along with the estimated costs of constructing the environmental control equipment also indicated a fair value of zero. Accordingly, EMG recorded an impairment charge of $1.03 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011.

Application to EMG's Midwest Generation Stations

A significant decline in power prices from September 30, 2011, combined with new environmental regulations and public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal-fired power plants. In connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements, EMG concluded, based on the current energy price environment, it is less likely that Midwest Generation will install environmental controls required by the CPS at its Fisk, 

79
Crawford and Waukegan Stations; and such assessment was an indicator that these stations were impaired. Management updated the probability weighted future undiscounted cash flows expected to be received at these stations and concluded that such amounts did not recover the respective station's carrying amounts. As part of these alternative cash flow scenarios, management considered a shortened estimated useful life of each station if environmental improvements were not made and a forecasted reduction in generation from lower forward power prices. In February 2012, Midwest Generation decided to shut down the Fisk Station by the end of 2012 and the Crawford Station by the end of 2014.

To measure the amount of the impairment loss, the income approach was considered the most relevant, but market data obtained prior to the significant decline in power prices was used to corroborate the income approach. The discounted cash flow analysis assumptions that have the most significant impact on fair value are forecasted energy and capacity prices. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated a fair value of zero. EMG also concluded it was unlikely that a third party would consummate the purchase of the Fisk, Crawford or Waukegan Stations in the current economic and regulatory environment resulting in a determination that the fair value of each of these stations is zero. This resulted in an impairment charge of $115 million, $186 million and $339 million for Fisk, Crawford and Waukegan Stations, respectively. Environmental and other remediation or ongoing maintenance costs are expected to be offset by the salvage value of the asset groups. 

The following table summarizes the net book value of the merchant coal-fired asset groups at December 31, 2011:

Application to Selected EMG Wind Projects

In connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements, management has reviewed the Storm Lake project and four small wind projects in Minnesota for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on an expected future increase in operating costs and declines in long-term power prices that the projects could potentially realize following the term of the power purchase agreements. The probability weighted future undiscounted cash flows of each project are not expected to be sufficient to recover the respective carrying value of each of these long-lived assets ($53 million in aggregate). The income approach was utilized to determine fair value for these asset groups. The most significant assumptions used in determining fair value were discount rates, future wind generation, the future availability of the project to generate energy and future plant operations expense. The asset groups at each project consisted of property, plant and equipment and, where appropriate, deferred revenue. In aggregate, the fair value of these five asset groups was determined to be $23 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $30 million.

EMG's Merchant Wind Projects

In light of the decline in forecasted power prices since September 30, 2011, EMG reviewed the long-term cash forecasts for the merchant wind projects in a manner consistent with the Key Assumptions and Approach Used described above. The expected future undiscounted cash flows of these projects recovered the carrying amount of these asset groups and, accordingly, no impairments were recorded. The expected future cash flows for these merchant wind projects are dependent upon a number of assumptions, the most significant of which are expected future power prices and operating costs. A decline in the forecasted cash flows in future periods could result in impairment, requiring a write-down of the carrying amount to fair value. The carrying values of the Goat Wind, Big Sky and Lookout asset groups at December 31, 2011 were $200 million, $344 million and $64 million, respectively.

Derivatives

Nature of Estimates Required. As described in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," SCE and EMG use derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rates. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value unless certain exceptions are met in which case the derivative is recorded on an accrual basis.

SCE records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability due to application of principles for rate-regulated enterprises. As a result, changes in fair value of SCE derivative instruments have no impact on earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows. SCE has not elected to use hedge accounting for these transactions due to the regulatory accounting treatment.

EMG records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value, with changes in 

80
the derivative's fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the effective portion of the changes in the derivative's fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. EMG records derivative instruments used for trading at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income.

Management's judgment is required to determine if a transaction meets the definition of a derivative and, if it does, whether the normal purchases and sales exception applies or whether individual transactions qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Management's judgment is also required to determine the fair value of derivative transactions.

Key Assumptions and Approach Used. SCE and EMG determine the fair value of derivative instruments based on forward market prices in active markets adjusted for nonperformance risk. If quoted market prices are not available, internally developed models are used to determine the fair value. When actual market prices, or relevant observable inputs are not available, it is appropriate to use unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions, including extrapolating limited short-term observable data and developing correlations between liquid and non-liquid trading hubs. In assessing nonperformance risks, SCE and EMG review credit ratings of counterparties (and related default rates based on such credit ratings) and prices of credit default swaps. The market price (or premium) for credit default swaps represents the price that a counterparty would pay to transfer the risk of default, typically bankruptcy, to another party. A credit default swap is not directly comparable to the credit risks of derivative contracts, but provides market information of the related risk of nonperformance.

In addition, a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. For further information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4. Fair Value Measurements."

Effect if Different Assumptions Used. As described above, fair value is determined using a combination of market information or observable data and unobservable inputs which reflect management's assumptions. Changes in observable data would impact results. In addition, unobservable inputs could have an impact on results. Fair value for Level 3 derivatives is derived using observable and unobservable inputs. As of December 31, 2011, the net fair value of EMG's Level 3 derivatives was an asset of $83 million. While it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one input, if the fair value of EMG's Level 3 derivatives were increased or decreased by 10%, the impact would be a $21 million increase or decrease to operating revenues. For EMG's derivative instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models, a significant change in estimate could affect EMG's results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, the net fair value of SCE's Level 3 derivatives was a liability of $754 million. SCE recovers its hedging related costs through the energy resource recovery account ("ERRA") balancing account, and as a result, exposure to commodity price risk is not expected to impact earnings, but may impact cash flows. For further sensitivities in Edison International's assumptions used to calculate fair value, see "EMG: Results of Operations—Fair Value Disclosures" and "SCE: Market Risk Exposures—Fair Value of Derivative Instruments." For further information on derivative instruments, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

Nuclear Decommissioning–ARO

Nature of Estimate Required. Regulations by the NRC require SCE to decommission its nuclear power plants which is expected to begin after the plants' operating licenses expire. In accordance with authoritative guidance, SCE is required to record an obligation to decommission its nuclear facilities. Nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in utility rates through contributions that are reviewed every three years by the CPUC. Due to regulatory accounting treatment, nuclear decommissioning activities are not expected to affect SCE earnings.

Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The liability to decommission SCE's nuclear power facilities is based on site-specific studies performed in 2008 and 2007 for San Onofre and Palo Verde, respectively, which estimate that SCE will spend approximately $8.6 billion through 2053 to decommission its active nuclear facilities. Decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each Nuclear Decommissioning Triennial Proceeding. The current estimate is based on the following assumptions from the 2008 and 2007 site-specific studies:

•Decommissioning Costs. The estimated costs for labor, dismantling and disposal costs, energy and miscellaneous costs.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

81
•Timing. Cost estimates are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the NRC operating licenses expire. The operating licenses currently expire in 2022 for San Onofre Units 2 and 3. When the site-specific study was completed, the licenses for the Palo Verde units were set to expire in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Effective April 2011, the licenses were extended to 2045, 2046 and 2047 for the Palo Verde units.

•Spent Fuel Dry Storage Costs. Cost estimates are based on an assumption that the DOE will begin to take spent fuel in 2015, and will remove the last spent fuel from the San Onofre and Palo Verde sites by 2051 and 2053, respectively. Costs for spent fuel monitoring are included until 2051 and 2053, respectively.

•Changes in decommissioning technology, regulation, and economics. The current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The ARO for decommissioning SCE's active nuclear facilities was $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability and related regulatory asset. The following table illustrates the increase to the ARO and regulatory asset if the escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

Nature of Estimate Required. Authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet; the assets and/or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income (loss) for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates. Edison International has a fiscal year-end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans.

Key Assumptions of Approach Used. Pension and other postretirement obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models. Two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement. Additionally, health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually. Other assumptions, which require management judgment, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.

As of December 31, 2011, Edison International's pension plans had a $4.5 billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was $144 million for 2011. As of December 31, 2011, Edison International's PBOP plans had a $2.6 billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was $44 million for 2011. Annual contributions made to most of SCE's pension plans are currently recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to the related annual expense.

82
The following are critical assumptions used to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit for 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The discount rate enables Edison International to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. Edison International selects its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis. This analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows, matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. Two corporate yield curves were considered, Citigroup and AON-Hewitt.

2 To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, current and expected asset allocations are considered, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. A portion of PBOP trusts asset returns are subject to taxation, so the 7.5% rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after-tax basis. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the pension plan assets were 2.2%, 2.0% and 5.9% for the one-year, five-year and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the PBOP plan assets were 1.2%, 0.8%, and 4.2% over these same periods. Accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees.

3 The health care cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.5% for 2019 and beyond.

Pension expense is recorded for SCE based on the amount funded to the trusts, as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes, in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis. Any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and will, over time, be recovered from or returned to customers. As of December 31, 2011, this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of $105 million, meaning that the accounting method has recognized more in expense than the ratemaking method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers' accounting for pensions in 1987.

As of December 31, 2011, Edison International had unrecognized pension costs of $1.1 billion and unrecognized PBOP costs of $749 million which primarily consisted of the cumulative impact of the reduced discount rates on the respective benefit obligations and the cumulative difference between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets. Of these deferred costs, $989 million of pension costs and $714 million of PBOP costs are recorded as regulatory assets, an offset to the underfunded liabilities of these plans, and will be amortized to expense over the average expected future service of employees.

Edison International's pension and PBOP plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility. SCE funds its pension and PBOP plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the CPUC. Executive pension plans and competitive power generation PBOP plans have no plan assets.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. Earnings could be impacted if the CPUC eliminates or modifies the current approved SCE regulatory recovery mechanism. 

The following table summarizes the increase or (decrease) to the projected benefit obligation for pension and the accumulated benefit obligation for PBOP if the discount rate were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

83
A one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease current year expense by $32 million and a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on PBOP plan assets would decrease current year expense by $16 million.

The following table summarizes the increase or (decrease) to the accumulated benefit obligation and annual aggregate service and interest costs for PBOP if the health care cost trend rate was changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:

Income Taxes

Nature of Estimates Required. As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, Edison International is required to estimate its income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it operates. This process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within Edison International's consolidated balance sheets.

Edison International takes certain tax positions it believes are applied in accordance with the applicable tax laws. However, these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the IRS, state tax authorities and the courts. Edison International determines its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance.

Key Assumptions and Approach Used. Accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment. Management uses judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that a tax position will be sustained, and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized. Judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes. In assessing its uncertain tax positions Edison International considers, among others, the following factors: the facts and circumstances of the position, regulations, rulings, and case law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the experience gained from similar tax positions. Management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements. Edison International continues to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws. A tax liability has been recorded with respect to tax positions in which the outcome is uncertain and the effect is estimable. Such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded. Furthermore, settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes" for a further discussion on income taxes.

Accounting for Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnities

Nature of Estimates Required. Edison International records loss contingencies when it determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into, Edison International records a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification. Gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized.

Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter, including the analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility, Edison International may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases. Edison International provides disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. Some guarantees and indemnifications could have a 

84
significant financial impact under certain circumstances, and management also considers the probability of such circumstances occurring when estimating the fair value.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, for guarantees and indemnities actual results may differ from the amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on Edison International's consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of contingencies, guarantees and indemnities, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies."
