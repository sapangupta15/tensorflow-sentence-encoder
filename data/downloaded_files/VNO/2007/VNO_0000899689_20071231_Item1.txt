 OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

   

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;    

   

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;    

   

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;    

   

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;    

   

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component;    

   

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and    

   

Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies.    

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. 

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS 

During 2007, we completed $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 33 separate transactions, consisting of an aggregate of $3,024,600,000 in cash, $958,700,000 in existing mortgage debt and $62,100,000 in common or preferred Operating Partnership units. Details of the significant transactions are summarized below.  

100 West 33rd Street, New York City (the Manhattan Mall) 

On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash. This mixed-use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block-front between 32nd and 33rd Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights. The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania.  

Bruckner Plaza, Bronx, New York 

On January 11, 2007, we acquired the Bruckner Plaza shopping center, containing 386,000 square feet, for approximately $165,000,000 in cash. Also included as part of the acquisition was an adjacent parcel which is ground leased to a third party. The property is located on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx, New York.  

Filenes, Boston, Massachusetts 

On January 26, 2007, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest, acquired the Filenes property located in the Downtown Crossing district of Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $100,000,000 in cash, of which our share was $50,000,000. The venture plans to redevelop the property to include approximately 1,400,000 square feet, consisting of office, retail and condominium apartments.

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS - CONTINUED 

H Street Building Corporation (H Street)  

In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000 of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet, and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10 acres of vacant land. In conjunction with this acquisition all existing litigation was dismissed.  

Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000. On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 note due December 31, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain on sale of $4,803,000. In April 2007, we received letters from the two remaining ground lessees claiming a right of first offer on the sale of the land, one of which has since retracted its letter and reserved its rights under the lease.  

In connection with purchase accounting, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.  

Our total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own, after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000, consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing mortgages.  

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street  

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan office building located on the block-front between 51st and 52nd Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the three- building 555 California Street complex (555 California Street) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Franciscos financial district. The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt. Our share of the debt is comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  

In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above. Mr. Trumps claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships. In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trumps motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trumps claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records. In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  

In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trumps claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims. We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit. All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS - CONTINUED 

India Property Fund L.P. 

On June 14, 2007, we committed to contribute $95,000,000 to the India Property Fund, L.P. (the Fund), established to acquire, manage and develop real estate in India. In addition, we sold our interest in another India real estate partnership to the Fund for $77,000,000 and deferred the $3,700,000 net gain on sale. On December 20, 2007, we increased our commitment to the Fund by $20,000,000. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund has equity commitments aggregating $227,500,000, of which our $115,000,000 commitment represents 50.6%. In January 2008, the Fund completed capital calls aggregating $50,400,000, of which our share was $25,500,000.  

Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition 

On June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $351,000,000. The properties are located primarily in Northern New Jersey and Long Island, New York. We have completed the acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate purchase price of $250,478,000 consisting of $109,279,000 in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units, $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000 of existing mortgage debt. We have determined not to complete the acquisition of the remaining six properties and have expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.  

BNA Complex 

On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (BNA) for $111,000,000 in cash. The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washingtons West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District. We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments. Simultaneously with the acquisition, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City, to BNA for $103,600,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000. 

INVESTMENTS IN MEZZANINE LOANS 

At December 31, 2007, the carrying amount of our investments in mezzanine loans aggregated $492,339,000, net of a $57,000,000 allowance described below. Substantially all of these investments are loans to companies that have significant real estate assets. Mezzanine loans are generally subordinate to first mortgage loans and are secured by pledges of equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. During 2007 we were repaid principal amounts aggregating $241,000,000 and we made new investments aggregating $217,000,000. As of December 31, 2007, these investments have a weighted average interest rate of 9.7%.  

On June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash. The loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56. We have reduced the net carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000, by recognizing a $57,000,000 non-cash charge which is included as a reduction of interest and other investment income on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

 OTHER INVESTMENTS 

GMH Communities L.P. (GMH) 

At December 31, 2007, we own 7,337,857 GMH Communities L.P. (GMH) limited partnership units, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (GCT), and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT, or 13.8% of the limited partnership interest of GMH. GMH is a self-advised, self-managed, specialty housing company that focuses on providing housing to college and university students residing off-campus and to members of the U.S. military and their families located on or near military bases throughout the United States.  

On February 12, 2008, GCT announced that it has entered into two definitive agreements in connection with the sale of its military and student housing divisions for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.61 per share/unit. In addition, GCT anticipates selling its remaining assets prior to the closing of the merger. The merger, which has been unanimously approved by GCTs Board of Trustees, is subject to GCT shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.  

As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in GMH and GCT based on GCTs December 31, 2007 closing share price of $5.52, was $54,400,000, or $48,860,000 below the carrying amount of $10.48 per share/unit on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not other-than-temporary, based on the aggregate value anticipated to be received as a result of the transactions described above, including the additional consideration from the sale of GCTs remaining assets. 

DISPOSITIONS 

Investment in McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds) (NYSE: MCD) 

In July 2005 we acquired 858,000 McDonalds common shares at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share. These shares were classified as available-for-sale marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and the fluctuations in the market value of these shares during the period of our ownership was recorded as other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. During October 2007, we sold all of these shares at a weighted average price of $56.45 per share and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership.  

During the second half of 2005, we acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,500 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as investment income or loss on our consolidated statements of income. In 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share. As of December 31, 2006, there were 13,695,500 option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of $32.70 per share. During August, September and October 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net gains of $108,821,000, $138,815,000 and $17,254,000, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.  

The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000. 

Property Sales  

During 2007, we sold three properties (Crystal Mall Two, Arlington Plaza and the Vineland, New Jersey shopping center property) in three separate transactions for an aggregate sales price of $177,874,000 in cash, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of $55,501,000.

 DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 

We are currently engaged in various development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.977 billion. Of this amount, $214.9 million was expended prior to 2007, $401.6 million was expended in 2007 and $719.6 million is estimated to be expended in 2008. Below is a description of these projects.

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - CONTINUED 

On July 19, 2005 a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and has been designated as the developer to convert the Farley Post Office in Manhattan, which occupies the super block between 31st and 33rd Streets from 8th to 9th Avenues, into the Moynihan Train Station. The plans for the Moynihan Train Station project include 300,000 square feet for a new transportation facility to be financed with public funding, as well as 850,000 square feet of commercial space and up to 1.0 million square feet of air rights intended to be transferred to an adjacent site. The venture endeavors to expand the plans to incorporate the adjacent super block to the east, relocating Madison Square Garden from its present site above Penn Station to the west end of the Farley Complex, permitting it to develop 5.5 million square feet of mixed use space on the old Madison Square Garden site and incorporate our existing 1.5 million square foot Two Penn Plaza into a 7.0 million square foot complex. In March 2007, New Yorks Empire State Development Corporation (the ESDC) acquired the Farley building from the United States Postal Service. In October 2007, the ESDC issued a Draft Scope of Work in connection with the preparation of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement describing the expanded development plan and proposing a zoning sub-district which would enable the venture to transfer the air rights under the original plans or the expanded plans to other locations within the Penn Plaza area. In addition, the Draft Scope of Work describes the public approvals and public actions necessary to implement either the original or expanded plans.  

On December 4, 2007 a joint venture in which we are the 80% controlling and development partner was selected as the developer of the north wing of the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The joint venture intends to enter into a 99 year lease with the Port Authority to create approximately 60,000 square feet of retail space and develop a 1.3 million square foot office tower. The Port Authority also intends to renovate and modernize the bus terminal. The parties are also discussing the redevelopment of the south wing of the terminal.  

We are evaluating other development opportunities, for which final plans and budgeted costs have yet to be determined, including: (i) redevelopment plans for the Hotel Pennsylvania, (ii) redeveloping certain shopping malls, including the Green Acres and Springfield Malls, (iii) redeveloping and expanding retail space and signage in the Penn Plaza area, (iv) conversion of 220 Central Park South, a residential apartment building, to condominiums and (v) other projects.  

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.

 FINANCING ACTIVITIES 

On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances. The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares. 

On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term. The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points (5.43% at December 31, 2007), based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. Together with the existing $1.0 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.595 billion of unsecured revolving credit. Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnerships obligations under both revolving credit agreements. The existing $1.0 billion credit facilitys financial covenants have been modified to conform to the financial covenants under the new agreement. Significant modifications include (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reduce the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures. Under the new agreement, Equity Value may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; Total Outstanding Indebtedness may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of Capitalization Value; the ratio of Combined EBITDA to Fixed Charges, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of Unencumbered Combined EBITDA to Unsecured Interest Expense, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, Unsecured Indebtedness may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets; and the ratio of Secured Indebtedness to Capitalization Value, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%). The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants. The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007. 

In addition to the above, during 2007 we completed approximately $1.111 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $412,674,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds. 

The net proceeds we received from the above financings were used primarily to fund acquisitions and investments and for other general corporate purposes. We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect these capital markets transactions. We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire our shares or any other securities in the future.  

11 

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and occupancy in warehouse operations due to the holiday seasons impact on the food industry.  

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES 

None of our tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES 

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part, as circumstances warrant, from time to time. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

EMPLOYEES  

As of December 31, 2007, we have approximately 4,020 employees, of which 311 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 128 employees and an additional 2,021 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary. The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 232, 200 and 559 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 569 employees. The forgoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Americold Realty Trust, Toys or Alexanders, in which we own 47.6%, 32.7% and 32.8%, respectively. 

SEGMENT DATA 

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics and Toys.
