Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Overview and Outlook  

L3s Business  

L3 is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications, logistics and maintenance), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment and security and detection systems. L3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. Our customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), foreign governments, and domestic and international commercial customers.  

We have the following three reportable segments: (1) Electronic Systems, (2) Aerospace Systems and (3) Communication Systems. Financial information for our segments is included in Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Electronic Systems provides a broad range of products and services, including components, products, subsystems, systems, and related services for military and commercial customers in several niche markets across several business areas. These business areas include precision engagement & training, sensor systems, power & propulsion systems, aviation products & security systems, warrior systems and advanced programs. Aerospace Systems delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides engineering, modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems. Communication Systems delivers products and services for the global communications market, specializing in strategic and tactical space, airborne, ground and sea-based communication systems. Effective March 1, 2017, we will realign our Electronic Systems segment in connection with the retirement of the segments president in the second quarter of 2017. The current Electronic Systems segment will be split into two separate segments named (1) Electronic Systems and (2) Sensor Systems. Accordingly, our structure will consist of the following four segments: (1) Aerospace Systems, (2) Communication Systems, (3) Electronic Systems and (4) Sensor Systems. We will report our results under the realigned business segments commencing in the first quarter of 2017 at which time we will restate the corresponding information for prior periods.  

On December 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our National Security Solutions (NSS) business to CACI International Inc. The transaction was completed on February 1, 2016. NSS provided cybersecurity solutions, high-performance computing, enterprise IT services, analytics and intelligence analysis to the DoD, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, federal civilian agencies and foreign governments. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of NSS are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to L3s continuing operations, unless specifically noted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

We generated sales of $10,511 million and $10,466 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and our primary customer was the DoD. See Part I — Item 1 — Business — Major Customers for additional information regarding a summary of our sales by end customer and the percent contributed by each to our total sales. 

Most of our contracts (revenue arrangements) with the U.S. Government are subject to U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency audits and various cost and pricing regulations and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. Multiyear U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable. Foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government.  

Business Environment 

U.S. Government Markets. Sales to U.S. Government customers represented 73% of our 2016 sales and were primarily to DoD customers, which comprised 70% of our sales. Therefore, our annual sales are generally highly correlated to changes in U.S. Government spending levels, especially DoD budget levels.  

The total DoD budget for FY 2015 was $560 billion, a decline of 4% as compared to the FY 2014 budget due to a decrease in the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. The FY 2015 base budget remained substantially unchanged from FY 2014 at $497 billion, while the OCO budget decreased by $22 billion. The total DoD budget for FY 2016 is $581 billion, an increase of 4% compared to FY 2015. The increase is due to a base budget of $522 billion, higher by $25 billion compared to FY 2015. The FY 2016 OCO budget declined slightly to $59 billion compared to $63 billion for FY 2015.  

On February 9, 2016, the Obama Administration submitted its FY 2017 DoD Budget Request. The total FY 2017 DoD Budget Request is $583 billion ($524 billion base budget, $59 billion OCO), which is substantially unchanged compared to the appropriated FY 2016 DoD budget. However, the FY 2017 DoD Budget Request was not approved or appropriated by Congress before October 1, 2016, and FY 2017 began with a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government, which expires on April 28, 2017. The CR maintains funding at the current FY 2016 appropriated level resulting in a prohibition on new program starts and multi-year contract awards. On December 23, 2016, President Obama signed the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes defense spending priorities and guidelines but does not appropriate money for those items. The NDAA largely supports the FY17 DoD Budget Request.  

Furthermore, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which suspended the debt ceiling through March 15, 2017 and raised spending caps previously enacted by Congress under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), places spending caps on defense programs. The BBA target for the DoD base budget is $551 billion for FY 2017 and $59 billion for the FY 2017 OCO funding. The BBA, however, does not change the previously enacted BCA sequestration cuts after FY 2017. The BCA specifies base budget spending caps and can only be changed through law enacted by Congress.

Source: United States Department of Defense fiscal year 2017 budget request.  

 (1)The annual budget changes for FY 2018 to FY 2021 are calculated on only the base budgets. The base budget cumulative average growth rate over the five-year period from FY 2016 to FY 2021 is approximately 2%. 

 (2)The FY 2017 DoD Budget Request did not include a budget amount for OCO appropriations after FY 2017, which will be addressed by the Trump Administration. 

Future DoD budgets and spending levels are determined by a number of factors beyond our control, including changes to U.S. procurement policies, current and future domestic and international budget conditions, presidential administration priorities and changing national security and defense requirements. Furthermore, the U.S. Governments overall fiscal challenges remain, including uncertainties regarding BCA sequestration cuts scheduled to resume in FY 2018. We expect the new Congress and the Trump Administration to continue to discuss various options throughout the budget appropriations process and complete the FY 2017 budget and submit an FY18 budget that includes an increase in OCO and supplemental budgets to address readiness shortfalls, as well as reforms to the federal income tax code and other significant policy initiatives. Although, we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts, which could have an impact on the Company, we believe that L3 will benefit from several of the DoDs focus areas such as ISR, unmanned systems, undersea warfare, precision strike, secure communications, missile defense and space programs, electronic warfare, aircraft readiness and the ability to project power in denied environments. For more information on the risks and uncertainties related to our U.S. Government contracts, see Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

International and Commercial Markets. Sales to end customers other than the U.S. Government represented 27% of our 2016 sales. We expect sales to international and commercial customers to represent 28% of our consolidated 2017 sales, an increase of 1% compared to 2016 primarily due to sales from businesses we acquired during 2016. These sales are generally affected by global economic conditions, geopolitical and security conditions and commodity prices, as well as our competitive success in winning new business and increasing market share. We believe that L3 will benefit from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and under FMS agreements between the U.S. Government and foreign governments. Although our international sales are experiencing near-term softness, we believe the focus of our international markets in areas such as ISR, simulators, communication systems, night vision products and sensors systems will benefit L3 in the long term. We also believe that the commercial markets in which we participate such as aviation products, security and screening, simulation and training, and RF microwave and power have long term favorable fundamentals.  

Key Performance Measures  

The primary financial performance measures that we use to manage our businesses and monitor results of operations are (i) sales, (ii) operating income and (iii) net cash from operating activities (Operating Cash Flow). Management believes that these financial performance measures are the primary growth drivers for our earnings per  

29  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

share and cash flow per common share. Generally, in evaluating our businesses and contract performance, we focus on net sales, operating income, operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of sales, and Operating Cash Flow, and not the type or amount of operating costs.  

One of our primary business objectives is to increase sales organically and through select business acquisitions. We define organic sales as net sales excluding the sales impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Sales declines related to business divestitures are sales from divestitures that are included in our actual results for the twelve-month period prior to the divestitures. Sales increases related to acquired businesses are sales from acquisitions that are included in our actual results for less than twelve-month period. We expect to supplement, strengthen and enhance our existing businesses by selectively acquiring businesses that: (1) add important new technologies and products, (2) provide access to select customers, programs and contracts and (3) provide attractive returns on investment. Another important financial performance measure that we use is operating margin, because sales growth combined with operating margin levels determine our operating income levels. Operating Cash Flow is also an important financial performance measure because Operating Cash Flow measures our ability to convert operating income into cash after paying income taxes and interest expenses and investing in working capital.  

Sales Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2016, consolidated net sales of $10,511 million increased by 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales increased $161 million, or 1.5% and net sales from business acquisitions was $93 million, or 0.9%. These increases were partially offset by divestitures of $209 million, or 2.0%. Our average annual sales declined for the five years ended December 31, 2016 by 2% due to a decline in average annual organic sales of approximately 2%. See Results of Operations, including segment results below for a further discussion of sales.  

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our largest contract (revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM), which is included in our Aerospace Systems segment. Under this contract, which generated approximately 4% of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 sales, we provide maintenance, logistics and other related sustainment support services for rotary wing aircraft assigned to Fort Rucker and satellite units in Alabama. Our period of performance under this contract continues through September 30, 2017. We are one of several contractors expected to bid on the re-competition of this contract and expect an award decision in the second half of 2017. 

We derived approximately 70% of our 2016 sales from DoD customers and, as a result, our sales are highly correlated to DoD budget levels. DoD budgets are a function of several factors and uncertainties beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, U.S. military engagements, changing national security and defense requirements, geo-political developments, actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for defense budgets, and sequestration and other DoD budget reductions. Any of these factors could result in a significant increase, decrease or redirection of DoD budgets and impact L3s future results of operations, including our sales and operating income growth rates. Additionally, L3s future results of operations will be affected by our ability to retain our existing business, including our revenue arrangements with DoD customers, and to successfully re-compete for existing business and compete for new business, which largely depends on: (1) our successful performance on existing contracts, (2) the effectiveness and innovation of our technologies and research and development activities, (3) our ability to offer better program performance than our competitors at an affordable cost and (4) our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones, particularly those employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above. We expect our 2017 consolidated sales to increase by approximately 2% compared to 2016, including an organic sales increase of 1%. We expect organic international sales to decline by approximately 3% due to the completion of certain contracts with foreign governments, and organic sales to the DoD and U.S. Government to increase by approximately 1%. We expect organic commercial sales to increase by approximately 2% primarily for commercial aviation products.  

Operating Income Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our consolidated and segment operating income was $1,008 million, an increase of 13% from $890 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our segment operating income as a percentage of sales (segment operating margin) was 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our consolidated operating income and consolidated operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 were impacted by a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $384 million and pre-tax losses of $31 million related to  

30  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

business divestitures. The pre-tax goodwill impairment charge and pre-tax losses related to business divestitures are excluded from segment operating income because they are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. See Results of Operations, including segment results below, for a further discussion of operating margin.  

Our effective management of labor, material, subcontractor and other direct costs is an important element of cost control and favorable contract performance. We believe that proactively re-sizing our businesses to their anticipated sales, combined with continuous cost improvement, will enable us to increase our cost competitiveness. While we continue to undertake cost management actions, such as reducing our indirect costs, resizing select business units and improving our productivity and contract performance in an effort to maintain or even increase operating margin, these efforts may not be successful and may be partially or fully offset by other cost increases. Although we expect our 2017 annual consolidated and segment operating margin to increase as compared to 2016, changes in the competitive environment and DoD procurement practices, lower consolidated sales and changes in annual pension expense, including related assumptions such as the benefit obligation discount rates, among other factors, could result in lower operating margin. Furthermore, select business acquisitions and new business, including contract renewals and new contracts, could have lower future operating margins compared to our operating margins on existing contracts and could reduce future consolidated and segment operating margins.  

Operating Cash Flow Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Operating Cash Flow was $1,097 million, an increase of 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to higher operating income adjusted for non-cash expenses, partially offset by higher uses of cash for working capital in the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Other Events  

Name Change and Elimination of Holding Company Structure. On December 31, 2016, we completed an internal reorganization to eliminate our holding company structure. Pursuant to the reorganization, L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (L-3 Holdings) was merged (the Merger) with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, L-3 Communications Corporation (L-3 Corp), with the subsidiary being the surviving entity in the Merger (the Surviving Entity). Immediately following the completion of the Merger, the name of the Surviving Entity was changed to L3 Technologies, Inc. (the Name Change). 

As a result of the Merger and the Name Change, all outstanding shares of L-3 Holdings common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of common stock of L3 Technologies, Inc., as the Surviving Entity, with economic, voting and other rights that are substantially identical. The common stock of L3 Technologies, Inc. commenced trading effective January 3, 2017 (the first trading day of 2017) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LLL, the same ticker symbol previously used by us. 

Issuance of Senior Notes. On December 5, 2016, we issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% Senior Notes that mature on December 15, 2026 (the 2026 Notes). The 2026 Notes were issued at a bond discount of $3 million. The net cash proceeds of $542 million from the offering plus cash on hand were used primarily to: (1) replenish the amount of cash used, and the amount of revolving credit borrowings drawn, to repay $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.95% Senior Notes which matured on November 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes), and (2) redeem all of our outstanding 1.50% Senior Notes due May 28, 2017 (the 2017 Notes), which had an aggregate principal amount of $350 million.  

Repurchases, Redemption and Maturities of Senior Notes. The repurchases, redemptions and maturities of senior notes are presented in the table below. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 (2)The 3.95% Senior Notes due 2016 were redeemed at a price equal to 101.475% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest ceased to accrue on and after May 20, 2016 and the only remaining right of holders of such Notes was to receive payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Discontinued Operations. On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our NSS business to CACI International Inc. for a sales price of $547 million. The sales price was finalized as of September 23, 2016, with no significant changes to preliminary amounts.  

The table below presents the statements of operations data for NSS, which was previously a reportable segment and has been classified as a discontinued operation and includes allocated interest expense for debt not directly attributable or related to L3s other operations. Interest expense was allocated in accordance with the accounting standards for discontinued operations and was based on the ratio of NSSs net assets to the sum of: (1) total L3 consolidated net assets and (2) L3 consolidated total debt. See Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)The year ended December 31, 2016 includes a gain of $64 million (before and after income taxes) on the sale of the NSS business.

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures  

As discussed above, one aspect of our strategy is to selectively acquire businesses that add new products and technologies, or provide access to select customers, programs and contracts. We intend to continue acquiring select businesses for reasonable valuations that will provide attractive returns to L3. Our business acquisitions, depending on their contract-type, sales mix or other factors, could reduce L3s consolidated operating margin while still increasing L3s operating income, earnings per share, and net cash from operating activities. In addition, we may also dispose of certain businesses if we determine that they no longer fit into L3s overall business strategy and we are able to receive an attractive price.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Acquisitions. The table below summarizes the acquisitions that we have completed during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 referred to herein as business acquisitions. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we used net cash of $388 million for business acquisitions. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)The purchase price represents the contractual consideration for the acquired business, excluding adjustments for net cash acquired and acquisition transaction costs. 

 (2)Excludes additional purchase price, not to exceed $38 million, which is contingent upon the post-acquisition financial performance of L3 MacDonald Humfrey for the three-year period ending December 31, 2019.

All of our business acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from their dates of acquisition. We regularly evaluate potential business acquisitions. On January 5, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the explosive trace detection (ETD) business of Implant Sciences Corporation (Implant) for a purchase price of $118 million, in addition to the assumption of specified liabilities. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.  

Business Divestitures. We regularly evaluate potential business divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed the sales of Marine Systems International (MSI), Broadcast Sports Inc. (BSI), the Tinsley Product Line and Klein Associates, Inc. (Klein). The adjustments we recorded related to the business divestitures are included in the loss related to business divestitures caption on the audited consolidated statements of operations and discussed below. Additionally, these adjustments, the proceeds received and net sales included in continuing operations related to our business divestitures, are summarized in the table below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

MSI Divestiture. On May 29, 2015, we completed the sale of our MSI business to Wärtsilä Corporation for a sales price of €295 million (approximately $318 million), in addition to the assumption by Wärtsilä Corporation of approximately €60 million of MSI employee pension-related liabilities. The sales price was finalized as of June 24, 2016, with no significant changes to preliminary amounts. MSI was a sector within our Electronic Systems segment,

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

primarily selling to the commercial shipbuilding industry. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $17 million ($6 million after income taxes, or $0.07 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the divestiture of MSI. The loss is comprised of: (1) $17 million for a non-cash impairment charge, (2) a loss of $4 million on a forward contract to sell Euro proceeds from the MSI divestiture and (3) a realized gain of $4 million upon completion of the sale of MSI.  

BSI Divestiture. On April 24, 2015, we divested our BSI business for a sales price of $26 million. BSI provided wireless technology and communications systems services for use in the field of sports television broadcasting and was included in the Sensor Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $4 million ($6 million after income taxes, or $0.08 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the divestiture of BSI.  

Tinsley Product Line Divestiture. On July 27, 2015, we divested our Tinsley Product Line for a sales price of $4 million. Tinsley provided optical components, sub-assemblies and passive sub-systems and was included in the Sensor Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss of $8 million ($6 million after income taxes, or $0.08 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Klein Divestiture. On December 31, 2015, we divested our Klein business for a sales price of $10 million. Klein provided side scan sonar equipment and waterside security and surveillance systems and was included in the Power & Propulsion Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2 million ($2 million after income taxes, or $0.02 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

NSS Divestiture. On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our NSS business to CACI International Inc. See Other Events – Discontinued Operations above for further discussion of the divestiture and impact on our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and cost of sales during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions for L3 relate to contract revenue, profit and loss recognition, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, market values for inventories reported at lower of cost or market, pension and post-retirement benefit obligations, stock-based employee compensation expense, income taxes, including the valuations of deferred tax assets, litigation reserves and environmental obligations, accrued product warranty costs, liabilities for the voluntary return program of various EoTech holographic weapons sight (HWS) products and the recoverability, useful lives and valuation of recorded amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Changes in estimates are reflected in the periods during which they become known. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and could differ materially. We believe that our critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and require judgment at the time of the estimate, (2) use of reasonably different assumptions could have changed our estimates, particularly with respect to estimates of contract revenues and costs, and recoverability of assets, and (3) changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  

Contract Revenue Recognition and Contract Estimates. Approximately 50% of our consolidated net sales are generated from contracts (revenue arrangements) that require us to design, develop, manufacture, modify, upgrade, test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment, and to provide related engineering and technical services according to the buyers specifications. These revenue arrangements or contracts are generally fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material type and are covered by contract accounting standards. Substantially all of our cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts are with the U.S. Government, primarily the DoD. Certain of our contracts with the U.S. Government are multi-year contracts that are funded annually by the customer, and sales on these multi-year contracts are based on amounts appropriated (funded) by the U.S. Government. Our remaining sales are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers.  

34  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Sales and profits on fixed-price type contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards are substantially recognized using percentage-of-completion (POC) methods of accounting. Sales on such contracts represent approximately 41% of our consolidated net sales. Sales and profits on fixed-price production contracts under which units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their contractual selling prices (the units-of-delivery method). Sales and profits on each fixed-price production contract under which units are not produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process, or under which a relatively few number of units are produced, are recorded based on the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative sales recognized in prior periods (the cost-to-cost method). Under both POC methods of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance, which can exceed one year.  

Accounting for the sales and profits on these fixed-price contracts requires the preparation of estimates of the: (1) total contract revenue, (2) total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work, and (3) measurement of progress towards completion. The estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion. Under the units-of-delivery method, sales on a fixed-price type contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period based on their contractual selling prices. Under the cost-to-cost method, sales on a fixed-price type contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by (i) the total estimated contract revenue, less (ii) the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units-of-delivery method or cost-to-cost method is equal to (i) the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized, less (ii) the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract. In the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenues, a loss arises, and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that the loss becomes evident. The unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded as a component of other current liabilities entitled Estimated cost in excess of estimated contract value to complete contracts in process in a loss position.  

Revisions or adjustments to estimates for a contracts revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. Revisions or adjustments may also be required if contract modifications occur. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured. The impact of revisions in profit (loss) estimates for all types of contracts subject to POC accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as reduce the valuations of receivables and inventories, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Aggregate net changes in contract estimates amounted to increases of $148 million, or 15%, of consolidated operating income ($1.22 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016, increases of $52 million, or 11%, of consolidated operating income ($0.45 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increases of $72 million, or 7%, of consolidated operating income ($0.52 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Sales and profits on cost-plus type contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. Sales on such contracts represent approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales. The estimated profit on a cost-plus contract is fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement types. Incentive and award fees are our primary variable fee contractual arrangement types. Incentive and award fees on cost-plus type contracts are included as an element of total estimated contract revenues and recorded as sales when a basis exists for the reasonable prediction of performance in relation to established contractual targets and we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates for them. Sales and profits on time-and-material type contracts are recognized on the basis of direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour, plus the actual costs of material and other direct non-labor costs. On a time-and-material type contract, the fixed hourly rates include amounts for the cost of direct labor, indirect contract costs and profit. Cost-plus type or time-and-material type contracts generally contain less estimation risks than fixed-price type contracts.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Sales on arrangements for (1) fixed-price type contracts that require us to perform services that are not related to the production of tangible assets (Fixed-Price Service Contracts), and (2) certain commercial customers are recognized in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers. Sales for our businesses whose customers are primarily commercial business enterprises are substantially all generated from single element revenue arrangements. Sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been performed, the selling price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales for Fixed-Price Service Contracts that do not contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual service period, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned, or obligations fulfilled, in a different manner. Sales for Fixed-Price Service Contracts that contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized when the units of work are completed. Sales and profit on cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts within the scope of accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers are recognized in the same manner as those within the scope of contract accounting standards, except for incentive and award fees. Cost-based incentive fees are recognized when they are realizable in the amount that would be due under the contractual termination provisions as if the contract was terminated. Performance based incentive fees and award fees are recorded as sales when objective evidence exists that the fees have been earned.  

For contracts with multiple deliverables, we apply the separation and allocation guidance under the accounting standard for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, unless all the deliverables are covered by contract accounting standards, in which case we apply the separation and allocation guidance under contract accounting standards. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables should be separated into more than one unit of accounting. We recognize revenue for each unit of accounting based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above.  

Sales and cost of sales in connection with contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government that contain collection risk, because the contracts are incrementally funded and subject to the availability of funds appropriated, are deferred until the contract modification is obtained, indicating that adequate funds are available to the contract or task order.  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018, with early application permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of our efforts to evaluate and implement the new standard along with our evaluation of the expected impact of the standard on our audited consolidated financial statements. 

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. In accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation). Identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. However, we do not recognize separate intangible assets for the assembled workforces of our business acquisitions.  

Generally, the largest separately identifiable intangible asset from the businesses that we acquire is the value of their assembled workforces, which includes the human capital of the management, administrative, marketing and business development, scientific, engineering and technical employees of the acquired businesses. The success of our businesses, including their ability to retain existing business (revenue arrangements) and to successfully compete for and win new business (revenue arrangements), is primarily dependent on the management, marketing and business development, contracting, engineering and technical skills and knowledge of our employees, rather than on productive capital (plant and equipment, and technology and intellectual property). Additionally, for a significant portion of our businesses, our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with top-secret and above clearances, is critical to our success and is often a prerequisite for retaining existing revenue arrangements and pursuing new ones. Generally, patents, trademarks and licenses are not material for our acquired businesses. Furthermore, our U.S. Government contracts (revenue arrangements) generally permit other companies to use our patents in most domestic work performed by such other companies for the U.S. Government. Therefore, because intangible assets for assembled workforces are part of goodwill, the substantial  

36  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

majority of the intangible assets for our acquired business acquisitions are recognized as goodwill. Additionally, the value assigned to goodwill for our business acquisitions also includes the value that we expect to realize from growth expectations and cost reduction measures that we implement for our acquired businesses. Goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the fair value of identifiable acquired assets, both tangible and intangible, less the fair value of liabilities assumed. At December 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $6,560 million and identifiable intangible assets of $238 million.  

The most significant identifiable intangible asset that is separately recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP for our business acquisitions is customer contractual relationships. All of our customer relationships are established through written customer contracts (revenue arrangements). The fair value for customer contractual relationships is determined, as of the date of acquisition, based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after-tax earnings and cash flows (including cash flows from working capital) arising from the follow-on sales on contract (revenue arrangement) renewals expected from customer contractual relationships over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales, less a contributory asset charge, all of which is discounted to present value. All identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives as the economic benefits are consumed. We review customer contractual relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with the accounting standards for long-lived assets. If any such event or change in circumstances occurs, and, if our revised estimates of future after-tax cash flows are significantly lower than our estimates at the date we acquired the customer contractual relationships, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write-down these intangible assets to their realizable values. We also review and update our estimates of the duration of our customer contractual relationships, at least annually. If such estimates indicate that the duration of our customer contractual relationships has decreased compared to the estimates made as of the date we acquired these intangible assets, then we accelerate the amortization period for our customer contractual relationships over their remaining useful lives.  

We review goodwill for impairment annually as of November 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The accounting standards for goodwill allow for the assessment of qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and entity relevant events or circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely or not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We did not utilize a qualitative assessment approach for the November 30, 2016 goodwill impairment test, as we chose instead to complete the quantitative two-step testing process for each reporting unit.  

A reporting unit is an operating segment, as defined by the segment reporting accounting standards, or a component of an operating segment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by operating segment management. Two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes if the components have similar economic characteristics.  

L3 had 10 reporting units at December 31, 2016 and at November 30, 2016 when our annual goodwill impairment assessment was completed. L3 also had 10 reporting units at December 31, 2015. 

L3s aggregate balance of goodwill from continuing operations increased by $279 million to $6,560 million at December 31, 2016 from $6,281 million at December 31, 2015 due to an increase of $335 million for business acquisitions, partially offset by $56 million for foreign currency translation adjustments. The table below presents the number of reporting units and the associated goodwill at December 31, 2016 for each of our reportable segments.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The first step in the process of testing goodwill for potential impairment is to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If a potential impairment is identified, the second step is to measure the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit. Our

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

methodology for determining the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation approach, and is dependent on estimates for future sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income tax payments, working capital changes and capital expenditures, as well as expected long-term growth rates for cash flows. All of these factors are affected by economic conditions related to the industries in which we operate (predominantly the U.S. defense industry), as well as conditions in the U.S. capital markets.  

We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We recorded aggregate goodwill impairment charges of $955 million in 2015 primarily due to a decline in the estimated fair value of the NSS business and the Vertex Aerospace business (formerly Logistics Solutions) as a result of the decline in their projected future cash flows. The adjustments we recorded related to goodwill impairment charges are presented in a separate caption on the audited consolidated statement of operations and are summarized below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The more significant assumptions used in our DCF valuations to determine the fair values of our reporting units in connection with the goodwill valuation assessment at November 30, 2016 were: (1) detailed three-year cash flow projections for each of our reporting units, (2) the expected long-term cash flow growth rates for each of our reporting units (commonly known as Terminal Growth Rates), which approximate the expected long-term nominal growth rate for the U.S. DoD budget, the U.S. economy and the respective industries in which the reporting units operate, expected inflation rates, and specific circumstances for each reporting unit, including contracts or programs ending and expected new business, and (3) risk adjusted discount rates, which represent the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each reporting unit and include the estimated risk-free rate of return that is used to discount future cash flow projections to their present values. There were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2016 as compared to the prior year DCF valuations of our reporting units.  

Each reporting unit WACC was comprised of: (1) an estimated required rate of return on equity, based on publicly traded companies with business and economic risk characteristics comparable to each of L3s reporting units (Market Participants), including a risk free rate of return of 2.73% on the 20 year U.S. Treasury Bond as of November 30, 2016 (2.63% as of November 30, 2015) and an equity risk premium of 6% (unchanged compared to November 30, 2015), and (2) an after-tax rate of return on Market Participants debt, which was derived from a selected Corporate bond index having a Baa debt rating, consistent with the credit rating of the Market Participants. Each of the estimated required rate of return on equity and the after-tax rate of return on Market Participants debt is weighted by the relative market value percentages of the Market Participants equity and debt. The WACC assumptions for each reporting unit are based on a number of market inputs that are outside of our control and are updated annually to reflect changes to such market inputs as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessments, including changes to: (1) the estimated required rate of return on equity based on historical returns on common stock securities of Market Participants and the Standard & Poors 500 Index over the prior five-year period, (2) the risk free rate of return based on the prevailing market yield on the 20 year U.S. Treasury Bond, (3) the rate of return on Corporate bonds having a debt rating consistent with the credit rating of the Market Participants, and (4) the relative market value percentages of Market Participants equity and debt.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table below presents the weighted average risk adjusted discount rate assumptions in WACC, used in our DCF valuation for each of our reportable segments for our goodwill impairment assessments at November 30, 2016 and 2015.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)The weighted average risk adjusted discount rate in WACC for the Electronic Systems reportable segment is comprised of separate discount rates for each reporting unit within the segment that range from 6.98% to 8.06% for 2016 and 7.00% to 8.12% for 2015.

 (2)The weighted average risk adjusted discount rate in WACC for the Aerospace Systems reportable segment is comprised of separate discount rates for each reporting unit within the segment that range from 6.98% to 9.11% for 2016 and 7.00% to 8.41% for 2015. 

 (3)The weighted average risk adjusted discount rate in WACC for the Communication Systems reportable segment is comprised of separate discount rates for each reporting unit within the segment that range from 6.98% to 8.01% for 2016 and 7.00% to 8.12% for 2015.

As presented in the table below, L3s historical three-year average annual cash flow growth rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 for our reportable segments ranged from a negative 6% to a positive 13%. The annual cash flows generated by each of our reporting units vary from year to year, and, therefore, the annual cash flow growth rates do not result in linear trends, due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) variability of annual sales volume and sales growth rates, (2) increases and decreases in working capital, including customer advance payments and billings on multi-year contracts (revenue arrangements) with long-term performance periods (exceeding one year), (3) the timing of invoicing and cash collections between fiscal years from receivables due from customers on multi-year contracts (revenue arrangements), (4) the timing of increases and decreases of select inventories procured and produced in anticipation of future product sales, which frequently overlap the ending and beginning of fiscal years, (5) the timing of the receipt of award fee and incentive fee payments from customers on contracts (revenue arrangements), (6) variability in annual cash outlays for research and development costs, (7) changes in cash outlays for capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and (8) increases in annual sales and costs and expense volumes of a reporting unit resulting from business acquisitions. As a result of the factors discussed above and the varying sizes of our reporting units, the annual cash flow levels and growth rates at the reporting unit level tend to fluctuate significantly from year to year.  

The 2016 cash flow amount and the cash flow growth rate for each of the last three years for each of our segments are presented in the following table.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)Reportable segment estimated cash flow excludes interest payments on debt and other corporate cash flows.

 (2)The increase in 2016 cash flows for Electronic Systems was primarily due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital expenditures primarily at Integrated Sensor Systems and Power & Propulsion. The decrease in 2015 cash flows was primarily related to Warrior Systems which was negatively impacted by costs related to alleged performance issues with EoTech’s HWS products and working capital reductions for night vision products in 2014 that did not recur in 2015, partially offset by increased cash flow at Aviation Products & Security due to increases in working capital requirements during 2014 that did not recur in 2015. The increase in 2014 cash flows was primarily a result of a lower effective tax rate, as well as lower working capital requirements at Warrior Systems, partially offset by an increase in working capital for MSI. 

 (3)The increase in 2016 cash flows for Aerospace Systems was primarily due to higher cash flows from operations compared to 2015 and lower working capital requirements at ISR Systems and Vertex Aerospace in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2015 cash flows was due to lower cash flows from operations compared to 2014 at Aircraft Systems due to cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts and higher working capital requirements at ISR Systems. The decrease in 2014 cash flows was due to lower cash flows from operations compared to 2013 at Vertex Aerospace and Aircraft Systems, partially offset by a decrease in tax payments as a result of a lower effective tax rate. 

 (4)The decrease in 2016 cash flows for Communication Systems was primarily due to higher working capital requirements in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2015 cash flows was due to an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in 2014 cash flows was due to lower working capital requirements and capital expenditures, as well as primarily higher cash flows from operations and a decrease in tax payments as a result of a lower effective income tax rate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

We consistently consider several factors to determine expected future annual cash flows for our reporting units, including, historical multi-year average cash flow trends by reporting unit and the expected future cash flow growth rates for each of our reporting units primarily based on our estimates of future sales, operating income, and working capital changes. Furthermore, the substantial majority of our reporting units are primarily dependent upon the DoD budget and spending. Sales from DoD customers generate a significant portion of our annual sales and have historically represented approximately 67% or more of our total sales. Accordingly, to determine expected future annual cash flows for our reporting units we also consider: (1) the DoD budget and spending priorities, (2) expansion into new markets, (3) changing conditions in existing markets for our products, systems and services, (4) possible termination of certain government contracts, (5) expected success in new business competitions and re-competitions on existing business, and (6) anticipated operating margins and working capital requirements, which vary significantly depending on the stage of completion (early, mature, ending) of contracts (revenue arrangements). We closely monitor changes in these factors and their impact on the expected cash flow of our reporting units. In addition to these factors that were relevant and specific to each of our reporting units, our goodwill impairment assessments as of November 30, 2016 assumed 3.0% nominal growth in the base budget beginning with FY 2018, consistent with the base budget cumulative average growth rate during the four year period from FY 2017 to FY 2021, as shown in the DoD budget table presented with our discussion of the business environment on page 29.  

Additionally, our actual cash flows may be higher than our projections, and the DCF valuation does not reflect actions that we may take to increase the profitability and cash flows of our reporting units. Actions we may take include consolidating and streamlining select business operations, creating future synergies with other L3 businesses or pursuing incremental targeted growth opportunities. Additionally, the DCF valuations do not assume future business acquisitions or divestitures.  

The table below presents the estimated: (1) 2017 cash flow amount, (2) average annual cash flow growth rates for 2017 – 2019 and (3) weighted average annual cash flow growth rates after 2019 for each of our reportable segments. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)Reportable segment estimated cash flow excludes interest payments on debt and other corporate cash flows. 

 (2)Electronic Systems projected cash flow is expected to decrease by $125 million from $500 million in 2016 to $375 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in forecasted tax payments as a result of a higher effective tax rate in 2017, higher working capital requirements at Power & Propulsion Systems and Aviation Products & Security, and higher capital expenditures at Precision Engagement & Training. Electronic Systems projected cash flows are expected to increase to $457 million by 2019, compared to $375 million in 2017 primarily due to forecasted annual sales growth of approximately 3% in 2018 and 2019, and an improvement in forecasted operating margins of approximately 70 basis points from 2017 to 2019. The improvement in forecasted operating margins from 2017 to 2019 is primarily due to higher expected sales volumes for the segment and a reduced level of spending for the Advanced Programs business forecasted in 2019. Additionally, cash flows are expected to improve by 2019 due to lower expected lease payments and capital expenditures.

 (3)Aerospace Systems projected cash flow is expected to decrease by $68 million from $280 million in 2016 to $212 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher working capital requirements, higher capital expenditures and lower cash flows from operations in 2017 at ISR Systems. Aerospace Systems projected cash flow levels are expected to increase to $222 million by 2019, compared to $212 million in 2017 primarily due to higher forecasted cash flows from operations from 2017 to 2019, partially offset by higher working capital requirements at ISR & Aircraft Systems.

 (4)Communications Systems projected cash flow is expected to decrease by $15 million from $187 million in 2016 to $172 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in working capital requirements at Broadband Communication Systems during 2016 that is not expected to recur in 2017 and higher forecasted tax payments as a result of a higher effective tax rate. Communication Systems projected cash flow levels are expected to increase to $181 million by 2019, compared to $172 million in 2017 primarily due to forecasted average annual sales growth of approximately 2.0% during 2018 and 2019, and an improvement in forecasted operating margins of approximately 50 basis points from 2017 to 2019 primarily related to the Space & Power Systems business for higher expected demand of power devices for commercial satellites and the Broadband Communications Systems business for higher expected volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems.

A decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment, and a related non-cash impairment charge against earnings, if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

As discussed above, the more significant assumptions used in our DCF valuations for each of our reporting units were detailed three-year undiscounted cash flow projections, risk adjusted discount rates, or WACC, used to discount the cash flow projections to their present value and expected Terminal Growth Rates. The current year (2017-2019) consolidated three-year undiscounted cash flow projections increased 12% compared to the prior year (2016-2018), with the changes by each reporting unit ranging from a decline of 2% to an increase of 29%. The risk adjusted discount rate, or WACC, decreased by an average of 20 basis points compared to the prior year valuations primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in the weighted average after-tax cost of debt. The expected Terminal Growth Rates utilized in the current year valuations increased by 50 basis points to 2.5% compared with those utilized in the prior year valuations for all reporting units except for the Space & Power business and the Aviation Products & Security reporting unit. The increase is slightly below the 2.8% cumulative average annual growth rate for the DoD base budget during the four year period from FY 2017 to FY 2021. The expected Terminal Growth Rate utilized for the Aviation Products & Security reporting unit was consistent with the 3% utilized in the prior year valuation. The Expected Terminal Growth Rate utilized for the Space & Power business, which is part of the Communication Systems reporting unit, increased from 2% in the prior year valuation to 3% in the current year valuation due to higher anticipated growth in the commercial satellites business. 

As part of our annual impairment test, we evaluated the sensitivity of the DCF fair value estimates for each reporting unit, which were used for our goodwill impairment assessment, by separately assessing the impact on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by: (1) increasing the risk adjusted discount rate (WACC) by 50 basis points, or (2) reducing the Terminal Growth Rate by 50 basis points, compared to those used in our estimated fair value calculations, while holding all other assumptions unchanged. All of our reporting units would have had a fair value in excess of their carrying value under both scenarios. In addition, we applied hypothetical decreases to the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units. We determined that a decrease in fair value of at least 20% would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value. 

As discussed previously, in addition to the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill may not be recoverable. As such, listed below are certain circumstances, depending on their outcomes, that may require us to review goodwill for impairment prior to the next annual assessment (November 30, 2017):  

 •lower than expected annual sales from our contracts with the DoD, arising from unanticipated changes or reductions to future DoD budgets; 

 •the ability of the reporting units to: (1) achieve 2017 projected sales, operating income and cash flow, and (2) win contract re-competitions and new business pursuits, including the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract re-competition at our Vertex Aerospace reporting unit. The Vertex Aerospace reporting unit goodwill balance was $187 million at December 31, 2016.

Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations. The obligations for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long-term assumptions, including discount rates and expected mortality for employee benefit liabilities, rates of return on plan assets, expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants in the case of pension plans, and expected annual increases in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of postretirement benefit obligations. These long-term assumptions are subject to revision based on changes in interest rates, financial market conditions, expected versus actual returns on plan assets, expected participant mortality and other actuarial assumptions, including future rates of salary increases, benefit formulas and levels, and rates of increase in the costs of benefits. Changes in the assumptions, if significant, could materially affect the amount of annual net periodic benefit costs recognized in our results of operations from one year to the next, the liabilities for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans. Our pension expense for 2017 is expected to increase by $10 million to $107 million from $97 million in 2016. Our discount rate assumption decreased from a weighted average rate of 4.67% at December 31, 2015 to 4.41% at December 31, 2016. The expected increase in our 2017 pension expense is primarily due to the decrease in the weighted average discount rate, partially offset by higher expected asset returns due to an increase in plan asset balances compared to the prior year. 

In 2016, we changed the approach utilized to measure the service and interest cost components of expense for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Historically, we measured the service and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to use a spot rate approach for our plans in  

41  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

the measurement of the components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation. The estimated weighted average discount rates used to measure 2016 pension service and interest costs were 4.83% and 3.95%, respectively. The previous method would have used a weighted average discount rate for both pension service and interest costs of 4.67%, which represented the weighted average discount rate used to determine our benefit obligation at December 31, 2015. This change resulted in a reduction to pension expense of approximately $28 million compared to the prior approach. This change did not result in a material impact to postretirement medical expense. See Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Pension Plans for a further discussion of our estimated 2017 pension expense. 

Discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense in any given period. The discount rate assumptions used to determine our pension and postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were based on a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the yield curve is required to have a rating of AA or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and/or Standard & Poors. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curve. For a sensitivity analysis projecting the impact of a change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense, see Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Pension Plans.  

Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. At December 31, 2016, we had deferred tax assets of $743 million, deferred tax liabilities of $965 million and a valuation allowance of $12 million. The deferred tax assets included $18 million for loss carryforwards and $6 million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods. Deferred income taxes are determined separately for each of our tax-paying entities in each tax jurisdiction. The future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and, to a lesser extent, our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies. Based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income and tax planning strategies, we believe that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets, except for capital losses and certain U.S. Federal, foreign and state net operating losses. A change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income, or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies, could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our deferred tax assets, and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and, if significant, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period.  

Liabilities for Pending and Threatened Litigation. We are subject to litigation, government investigations, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business or assumed in connection with certain business acquisitions. In accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies, we accrue a charge for a loss contingency when we believe it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is within a range of specified amounts, the most likely amount is accrued, and we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range represents a better estimate. Generally, we record the loss contingency at the amount we expect to pay to resolve the contingency and the amount is generally not discounted to the present value. Amounts recoverable under insurance contracts are recorded as assets when recovery is deemed probable. Contingencies that might result in a gain are not recognized until realizable. Changes to the amount of the estimated loss, or resolution of one or more contingencies could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our litigation matters.  

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets. In addition to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with our business acquisitions, our long-lived assets also include property, plant and equipment, capitalized software development costs for software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, and certain long-term investments. At December 31, 2016, the consolidated carrying values of our property, plant and equipment were $1,121 million, capitalized software development costs were $56 million and certain long-term investments were $11 million. At December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment represented 9% of total  

42  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

assets, and the carrying value of our capitalized software development costs and certain long-term investments each represented less than 1% of total assets. We review the valuation of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value or net realizable value expected to result from the assets use and eventual disposition. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Long-lived assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, and other factors depending on the asset, including estimated future sales, profits and related cash flows, estimated product acceptance and product life cycles, changes in technology and customer demand, and the performance of invested companies and joint ventures. Changes in estimates and judgments on any of these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Sales from products decreased by $147 million to $6,442 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6,589 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Product sales represented 61% and 63% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales from products declined by $156 million due to the divestiture of MSI on May 29, 2015 and $86 million in the Space & Power Systems sector primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial satellites. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $49 million in the Broadband Communications Systems sector primarily due to increased volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems for the DoD and $46 million primarily for Aviation Products & Security due to deliveries of airport security screening systems to international customers and commercial aviation recorders products. 

Sales from services increased by $192 million to $4,069 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3,877 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Service sales represented 39% and 37% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales from services increased by: (1) $72 million due to the CTC Aviation Group (L3 CTC), ForceX and Aerosim business acquisitions, (2) $66 million for Vertex Aerospace primarily due to higher volume and pre-production activities for U.S. Navy training aircraft and the U.S. Army C-12 contract and (3) $54 million primarily for Broadband Communications Systems due to increased volume for logistics support services for the DoD. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of our segment sales trends. 

Operating income and operating margin: Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $533 million to $1,008 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $118 million, or 13%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Segment operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Segment operating margin increased by: (1) 100 basis points due to losses in 2015 at Aerospace Systems on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts which did not recur and (2) 40 basis points due to lower pension expense of $45 million. These increases were partially offset by sales mix changes. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

Interest expense and other: Interest expense and other for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7 million of debt retirement charges related to the redemption of: (1) $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes in the second quarter of 2016 and (2) $350 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Effective income tax rate: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 22.2%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was not meaningful due to the goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges and related income tax benefits, the effective income tax rate for 2015 would have been 20.5%. The increase in the effective income tax rate was driven by lower foreign tax benefits and lower Federal Research and Experimentation (R&E) tax credits in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by a benefit of $17 million due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard related to income tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation awards.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations: Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $647 million, compared to $282 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $8.21 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.44 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations: Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 increased 14% to $647 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 19% to $8.21.  

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding: Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 declined by 4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to repurchases of L3 common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, partially offset by additional shares issued in connection with various employee stock-based compensation programs and contributions to employee savings plans made in common stock.

2015 Compared with 2014  

Net Sales: For the year ended December 31, 2015, consolidated net sales of $10.5 billion decreased $520 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 declined $269 million, or 3%. Organic sales exclude $354 million related to business divestitures and $103 million from business acquisitions. Sales to the U.S. Government declined 2%, or $173 million, to $7,291 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7,464 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, driven primarily by U.S. defense budget constraints and reductions from sequestration and by the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan. Sales to international and commercial customers declined 10%, or $347 million, to $3,175 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3,522 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $92 million, or 3%, driven by foreign currency exchange rate changes.  

Sales from products decreased by $250 million to $6,589 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $6,839 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Product sales represented 63% and 62% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales from products declined by: (1) $260 million related to the divestiture of MSI, (2) $113 million for Aircraft Systems due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts and lower volume to the United States Air Force (USAF) from the DoDs planned reduction of the Compass Call aircraft and the DoDs retirement of the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA), (3) $79 million related to foreign currency exchange rate changes, (4) $49 million for reduced sales at Warrior Systems driven by lower volume for night vision goggles and the HWS voluntary return program at EoTech and (5) $37 million for Space & Power Systems primarily due to lower volume for satellite command and control software for U.S. Government agencies and high frequency radios for a foreign government. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of: (1) $130 million primarily for large ISR aircraft systems for U.S. Government customers and small ISR aircraft systems to the DoD and a foreign government, (2) $100 million primarily due to a higher mix of product sales for Broadband Communication Systems and (3) $58 million primarily for Aviation Products & Security due to deliveries of cockpit avionics products to commercial and DoD customers and airport security systems products to international customers.  

Sales from services decreased by $270 million to $3,877 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $4,147 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Service sales represented 37% and 38% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales from services declined by: (1) $81 million due to a lower mix of services sales for Broadband Communication Systems, (2) $72 million primarily related to lower sales for small ISR aircraft fleet management services to the DoD due to the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan, (3) $72 million related to the MSI and BSI business divestitures, (4) $63 million related to lower volume for field maintenance and sustainment services, primarily for U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft due to the completion of contracts and lower demand and lower prices due to competitive pressures, and (5) $29 million related to foreign currency exchange rate changes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $47 million primarily due to a higher mix of services sales for Aircraft Systems. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of our segment sales trends.  

Operating income and operating margin: Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $537 million to $475 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $122 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Segment operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 9.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven by higher pension expense of $61 million and unfavorable contract performance adjustments at the Aerospace Systems segment, partially offset by outside accounting and legal advisory expenses incurred in 2014 for the internal review at Aerospace Systems completed in October 2014. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

Interest expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $11 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the issuance of $1 billion in new debt on May 28, 2014, partially offset by the redemption of our 3% Convertible Contingent Debt securities in June 2014.  

45  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Interest and other income, net: Interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased primarily due to lower interest income for a benefit plan trust and lower interest income accretion related to the net investment in sales-type leases of flight simulator systems during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a loss recorded on the sale of a business within the Warrior Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment during the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Effective income tax rate: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is not meaningful due to the goodwill impairment charges taken during 2015. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges and related income tax benefit, the effective income tax rate for 2015 would have decreased to 20.5% from 26.0% in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) $17 million of foreign tax benefits related to a legal restructuring of our foreign entities and (2) an increased benefit from the Federal R&E Tax Credit.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations: Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 in the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $282 million, compared to $632 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 52% to $3.44 from $7.20 in the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations: Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 decreased 10% to $566 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 4% to $6.91.  

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding: Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2015 declined by 7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to repurchases of L3 common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, partially offset by additional shares issued in connection with various employee stock-based compensation programs and contributions to employee savings plans made in common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table below presents a reconciliation of: (1) net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 to adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and (2) diluted EPS from continuing operations to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (3)Adjusted diluted EPS is diluted EPS attributable to L3's common stockholders, excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. Adjusted net income attributable to L3 is net income attributable to L3, excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. These amounts are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges affect the comparability of the results of operations of 2015 to the results of operations for 2016. We also believe that disclosing net income and diluted EPS excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges will allow investors to more easily compare the 2016 results to the 2015 results. However, these measures may not be defined or calculated by other companies in the same manner.

 (4)Amounts may not recalculate directly due to rounding.

Electronic Systems  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2016 Compared with 2015  

Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $50 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales increased $81 million, or 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales exclude $209 million of sales declines related to business divestitures and $78 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. Sales increased by: (1) $42 million for Aviation Products & Security due to: (i) deliveries of airport security screening systems to international customers and commercial aviation recorders products and (ii) higher volume for overhaul and repair services for cockpit display products to the USAF and a new commercial cockpit control/display unit product, (2) $21 million for Power & Propulsion Systems primarily due to higher volume for Hybrid Electric Drive contracts, and power conversion and

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

distribution systems to the U.S. Navy and an allied foreign naval customer and (3) $18 million primarily for Sensor Systems due to increased deliveries of infrared detection and space electronics products to the U.S. Air Force and higher volume for photonics masts products to the U.S. Navy. 

Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $29 million, or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 12.3%. Operating margin increased by 40 basis points primarily due to higher margins related to acquisitions and divestitures and 40 basis points due to lower pension expense of $15 million. 

As previously disclosed, in November 2015, we commenced a voluntary return program and began accepting customer returns for various EoTech HWS products that may have been affected by certain performance issues. The refund program gives eligible owners of such HWS products the option to return their products in exchange for a refund of the purchase price, including shipping costs. During 2016, we increased our product returns allowance by recording a reduction to net sales of $18 million. We continue to review the product returns allowance as the program matures and new information becomes available. Our ongoing evaluation may cause us to record further adjustments to the allowance in future periods. These adjustments could be material. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

2015 Compared with 2014  

Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $376 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding $354 million related to the divestitures of MSI, BSI, and the Tinsley Product Line, and $49 million for the CTC and ForceX acquisitions, organic sales declined $71 million, or 2%. The decrease was due to: (1) $85 million related to foreign currency exchange rate changes and (2) $24 million related to reduced sales at Warrior Systems driven by lower volume for night vision goggles and $20 million related to the HWS voluntary return program at EoTech. These decreases were partially offset by $58 million, primarily for Aviation Products & Security, due to deliveries of cockpit avionics products to commercial and DoD customers and airport security systems products to international customers.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $44 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin remained at 11.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin increased by: (1) 50 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, (2) 40 basis points for favorable contract performance adjustments and (3) 20 basis points due to lower severance expense of $8 million. These increases were offset by decreases of: (1) 80 basis points primarily due to lower volume for Sensor Systems and sales mix changes for Aviation Products & Security and (2) 30 basis points due to higher pension expense of $13 million.  

Aerospace Systems  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2016 Compared with 2015  

Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $84 million, or 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Sales increased $66 million for Vertex Aerospace and $36 million for Aircraft Systems, partially offset by an $18 million decrease for ISR Systems. Sales increased for Vertex Aerospace primarily due to higher volume and pre-production activities for U.S. Navy training aircraft and the U.S. Army C-12 contract. Sales increased for Aircraft Systems primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016 on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. Sales decreased for ISR Systems by: (1) $148 million for large ISR aircraft systems for foreign military customers as contracts near completion and (2) $91 million for small ISR aircraft fleet management services to the U.S. Air Force due to reduced demand resulting from the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan. These decreases for ISR Systems were partially offset by increases of: (1) $107 million primarily due to the  

49  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

procurement and delivery of two business jets to foreign military customers in the 2016 second quarter, (2) $74 million due to higher volume for special mission aircraft and large ISR aircraft systems primarily for the U.S. Government and (3) $40 million due to higher volume for small ISR aircraft systems primarily for the U.S. Army. 

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $84 million, or 41%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating margin increased by 190 basis points to 6.8%. Operating margin increased by: (1) 170 basis points primarily due to net aggregate unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015, which included $101 million of cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016, (2) 40 basis points due to improved performance on the Army C-12 contract due to better terms on the new contract which began August 1, 2015 and (3) 40 basis points due to lower pension expense of $17 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 60 basis points primarily due to sales mix changes at ISR Systems. 

2015 Compared with 2014  

Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $165 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales decreased $159 million for Aircraft Systems and $63 million for Vertex Aerospace. Sales for ISR Systems increased by $57 million. Sales decreased for Aircraft Systems due to lower volume of: (1) $74 million primarily on the USAF Compass Call aircraft and the DoDs retirement of the JCA, (2) $39 million on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments, (3) $28 million for modification contracts primarily for the U.S. Navy maritime patrol aircraft and (4) $18 million primarily for aircraft cabin assemblies and subassemblies. The decrease in sales for Vertex Aerospace was due to lower volume for field maintenance and sustainment services, primarily for U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft due to the completion of contracts and lower demand and lower prices due to competitive pressures. The increase in ISR Systems was due to an increase in sales of $182 million primarily for large ISR aircraft systems for U.S. Government customers and small ISR aircraft systems to the DoD and a foreign government, partially offset by $125 million of lower sales for small ISR aircraft fleet management services to the DoD due to the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $78 million, or 28%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin decreased by 160 basis points to 4.9%. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 250 basis points due to contract performance adjustments at Aircraft Systems, which included $101 million of cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, compared to $15 million of cost growth on the same contracts in the year ended December 31, 2014, (2) 100 basis points primarily due to reduced flight hours and lower pricing due to competitive pressures on logistics and maintenance contracts, including the U.S. Navy T-45 contract, and (3) 70 basis points due to higher pension expense of $28 million. These decreases were partially offset by: (1) 110 basis points due to favorable contract performance adjustments at ISR Systems, (2) 70 basis points for improved performance on the Army C-12 contract due to better terms on the new contract and $18 million due to a partial recovery of cost overruns recognized in prior periods on the previous contract, (3) 40 basis points due to a $17 million increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory at Vertex Aerospace recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 and (4) 40 basis points due to $25 million of outside accounting and legal advisory expenses incurred for the internal review of Aerospace Systems segment completed in October 2014.  

Communication Systems  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2016 Compared with 2015  

Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $11 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales decreased by $4 million, or 0.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales exclude $15 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions.  

50  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The decrease was due to: (1) $88 million in the Space & Power Systems sector, primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial satellites, and (2) $64 million in the Tactical Satcom sector due to fewer deliveries on a satellite communications (SATCOM) land terminals contract for the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which was completed in the second quarter of 2016. These decreases were largely offset by increases of $109 million in the Broadband Communication Systems sector primarily due to increased volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems for the DoD and $39 million primarily for increased volume and deliveries to the DoD of mobile and ground-based SATCOM systems for the U.S. military in the Tactical Satcom sector. 

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 9.8%. Operating margin increased by 60 basis points due to lower pension expense of $13 million, partially offset primarily due to sales mix changes.  

2015 Compared with 2014  

Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $21 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding $55 million related to the Miteq acquisition, organic sales declined by $34 million, or 2%. The decrease was due to: (1) $37 million for the Space & Power Systems sector, primarily satellite command and control software for U.S. Government agencies and high frequency radios for a foreign government, and (2) $20 million for the Advanced Communications sector, primarily secure data recorders and communications equipment for the U.S. military as contracts near completion. These decreases were offset by $23 million for the Broadband Communication Systems sector, primarily due to increased volume for development and production of secure networked communication systems for the U.S. military. For the Tactical Satcom sector, lower sales of mobile and ground based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military were offset by sales on a new contract for the ADF.  

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 remained the same at $196 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin decreased by 10 basis points to 9.6%. Operating margin decreased by 100 basis points due to higher pension expense of $20 million. Improved contract performance and sales and mix changes, partially offset by lower margins from the Miteq acquisition, increased operating margin by 90 basis points. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Anticipated Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  

At December 31, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $363 million. While no amounts of the cash and cash equivalents are considered restricted, $197 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of cash held in non-U.S. jurisdictions is subject to local capital requirements, as well as income tax considerations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations, cash on hand and our new five-year unsecured $1 billion revolving credit facility (Credit Facility), which we entered into on October 31, 2016. The Credit Facility replaced the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, which was to expire on February 3, 2017. At December 31, 2016, we had the full availability of our Credit Facility. We generated $1,097 million of net cash from operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 and we received net cash proceeds of $561 million primarily for the NSS divestiture. Significant cash uses during the year ended December 31, 2016 included $388 million related to the business acquisitions, $373 million related to repurchasing shares of our common stock, $309 million for net debt reductions, $220 million related to the payment of dividends and $216 million related to capital expenditures.  

We currently believe that our cash from operating activities generated during the year, together with our cash on hand, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, defined benefit plan contributions, commitments, contingencies, research and development expenditures, select business acquisitions (depending on the size), program and other discretionary investments, interest payments, income tax payments, L3 dividends and share repurchases. 

Balance Sheet  

Billed receivables decreased by $15 million to $731 million at December 31, 2016 from $746 million at December 31, 2015 primarily due to: (1) the timing of billings and collections for ISR and Aircraft Systems and (2) $10 million for foreign currency translation adjustments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $25 million from business acquisitions.  

51  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Contracts in process decreased by $26 million to $2,055 million at December 31, 2016 from $2,081 million at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, contracts in process decreased: (1) $17 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and (2) $14 million comprised of:  

 •decreases of $24 million in unbilled contract receivables primarily due to shipments for Aircraft Systems and Broadband Communication Systems, partially offset by sales exceeding billings for Aviation Products & Security, and 

 •increases of $10 million in inventoried contract costs, primarily due to the timing of deliveries for Space & Power Systems. 

Business acquisitions increased contracts in process by $5 million. 

L3s receivables days sales outstanding (DSO) was 66 at December 31, 2016, compared with 70 at December 31, 2015. We calculate our DSO by dividing: (1) our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables by (2) our trailing 12 month sales adjusted, on a pro forma basis, to include sales from business acquisitions and exclude sales from business divestitures that we completed as of the end of the period and discontinued operations, multiplied by the number of calendar days in the trailing 12 month period (366 days at December 31, 2016 and 365 days at 2015). Our trailing 12 month pro forma sales were $10,655 million at December 31, 2016 and $10,314 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in DSO during 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in net billed and unbilled contract receivables, which is discussed above, and the increase in our trailing 12 month pro forma sales.  

Inventories decreased by $3 million to $330 million at December 31, 2016 from $333 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to Aviation Products & Security Systems deliveries of airport security screening systems to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and foreign customers, substantially offset by $23 million of acquired inventories from the L3 MacDonald Humfrey business acquisition.  

The increase in other current assets was primarily due to insurance receivables principally for the Securities Class Action described in Note 18 (the Securities Class Action) to our audited consolidated financial statements and $7 million from business acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in income tax receivables due to the application of accrued U.S. federal income tax overpayments to offset estimated tax payments.  

The decrease in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations was due to the completion of the NSS divestiture during 2016. 

The increase in property, plant and equipment was primarily due to capital expenditures exceeding depreciation expense during 2016.  

Goodwill increased by $279 million to $6,560 million at December 31, 2016 from $6,281 million at December 31, 2015. The table below presents the changes in goodwill by segment.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)The net increase in goodwill for the Electronic Systems segment was due to the L3 MacDonald Humfrey, Aerosim and Micreo business acquisitions, as well as the final purchase price allocations for the L3 ForceX and L3 CTC business acquisitions. The increase in goodwill for the Communication Systems segment was due to the ATM business acquisition.

 (2)The decrease in goodwill presented in the Electronic Systems segment was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, the Euro and the Australian dollar, offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar during 2016. The increase in goodwill presented in the Aerospace Systems segment was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar during 2016.

The increase in identifiable intangible assets was primarily due to $74 million of intangible assets recognized for the business acquisitions, primarily the L3 MacDonald Humfrey business acquisition, partially offset by amortization expense.  

52  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The fluctuations in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of when invoices for purchases from third party vendors and subcontractors were received and payments were made and $14 million of acquired balances from the business acquisitions.  

The decrease in advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred was primarily due to the liquidation of balances on contracts for Aircraft Systems, ISR Systems, Aviation Products & Security, and Broadband Communication Systems and $15 million for foreign currency translation adjustments. These decreases were partially offset by increases in advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred due to cash collections on performance based billings for Power & Propulsion Systems, Precision Engagement & Training, and Sensors Systems and $13 million of acquired balances from the business acquisitions. 

The increase in other current liabilities was primarily due to the anticipated costs of the settlements in principle in respect of the Securities Class Action and the EoTech Class Actions described in Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements and $7 million from business acquisitions.  

The increase in deferred tax liabilities was primarily due to the tax amortization of certain goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset for pension liabilities during 2016.  

Pension Plans  

L3 maintains defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 25% of its employees. At December 31, 2016, L3s projected benefit obligation (PBO), which includes accumulated benefits plus the incremental benefits attributable to projected future salary increases for covered employees, was $3,758 million and exceeded the fair value of L3s pension plan assets of $2,721 million by $1,037 million. At December 31, 2015, L3s PBO was $3,448 million and exceeded the fair value of L3s pension plan assets of $2,552 million by $896 million. The $141 million increase in our unfunded status was primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average discount rate from 4.67% at December 31, 2015 to 4.41% at December 31, 2016. 

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption represents the average rate that we expect to earn over the long-term on the assets of our benefit plans, including those from dividends, interest income and capital appreciation. We utilize a third-party consultant to assist in the development of the expected long-term return on plan assets, which is based on expectations regarding future long-term rates of return for the plans investment portfolio, with consideration given to the allocation of investments by asset class and historical and forward looking rates of return for each individual asset class. With respect to the determination of our expected long-term return on plan assets assumption for the year ended December 31, 2016, we considered: (1) a 20-year forward looking return on plan assets as developed by our third-party consultant, which is currently 7.81% for our U.S. plans and 7.25% for our Canadian plans, and (2) our historical returns. While we review historical rates of return on our plan assets, the substantial volatility in any one year can result in historical data that is less indicative of future returns. Accordingly, we give greater consideration toward forward looking returns in developing our expected long-term return on plan assets assumption. In reviewing our historical returns, we noted that the average annual return on our U.S. pension plan assets over the period since L3s formation in 1997 through 2015, net of investment management fees and administrative costs, determined on an arithmetic basis, was 6.92%. Arithmetic annual averages represent the simple average returns over independent annual periods. In addition, the actual annual returns have exceeded our long-term return on plan assets assumption in 12 of the past 19 years since L3s formation. Due to a reduction in forward looking and historical returns on our plan assets compared to the prior year, we decreased our existing long-term return on plan assets assumption of 8.25% for our U.S plans by 25 basis points to 8.00% in 2016. The long-term return on plan assets assumption of 7.25% for our Canadian plans did not change. Based on the forward looking and historical returns on our plan assets discussed above and an allotment for active management, we believe our weighted average long-term return on plan assets assumption in 2016 of 7.92% is within a reasonable range.  

We recorded net actuarial losses of $179 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average discount rate, which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Actuarial gains and losses in a period represent the difference between actual and actuarially assumed experience, primarily due to discount rates and pension plan asset returns. Actuarial gains and losses that our pension plans experience are not recognized in pension expense in the year incurred, but rather are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The accumulated gains and losses in excess of a corridor, defined as the greater of 10% of the fair value of a plans assets and 10% of its projected benefit obligation, are generally amortized to pension expense in future periods over the estimated average remaining service periods of the covered employees. See Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans.  

53  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Our pension expense for 2016 was $97 million. We currently expect pension expense for 2017 to increase $10 million to approximately $107 million primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average discount rates, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns due to an increase in plan asset balances compared to the prior year.  

Our pension expense for 2017 may be different from our current expectations when finalized due to a number of factors, including the effect of any future business acquisitions and divestitures for which we assume liabilities for pension benefits, changes in headcount at our businesses that sponsor pension plans, actual pension plan contributions and changes (if any) to our pension assumptions for 2017, including the discount rate, mortality rates, expected long-term return on plan assets and salary increases.  

Our cash pension contributions for 2016 were $97 million and we currently expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans in 2017. Actual 2017 pension contributions could be affected by changes in the funded status of our pension plans during 2017. A substantial portion of our pension plan contributions for L3s businesses that are U.S. Government contractors are recoverable as allowable indirect contract costs at amounts generally equal to the annual pension contributions.  

Our projected benefit obligation and annual pension expense are significantly affected by, holding all other assumptions constant, certain actuarial assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a change in certain assumptions for our pension plans and resulting increase (decrease) to the 2017 expected pension expense and PBO at December 31, 2016.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Statement of Cash Flows  

The table below provides a summary of our cash flows from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities — Continuing Operations  

2016 Compared with 2015. We generated $1,097 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $28 million compared with $1,069 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations of $364 million, partially offset by: (1) lower non-cash expenses of $308 million primarily non-cash goodwill impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2015 and (2) higher uses of cash for working capital of $28 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities is further discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources — Balance Sheet.  

2015 Compared with 2014. We generated $1,069 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $19 million compared with $1,088 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was due to $348 million of lower income from continuing operations. This decrease was partially offset by increases of: (1) $269 million for higher non-cash expenses related to goodwill impairment charges, net of related tax benefits and (2) $60 million of less cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

54  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Interest Payments. Our cash from operating activities included interest payments on debt of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our interest expense also included amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond discounts, which are non-cash items.  

Investing Activities — Continuing Operations  

During 2016, we used $16 million of cash from investing activities, which included $388 million for business acquisitions discussed under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and $216 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $561 million of cash received from business divestitures (primarily NSS).  

During 2015, we used $192 million of cash primarily to: (1) acquire three businesses discussed under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures for $320 million and (2) pay $197 million for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds received of $318 million from the MSI, BSI, Tinsley Product Line and Klein divestitures.  

During 2014, we used $221 million of cash primarily to: (1) acquire L3 Data Tactics and (2) pay $174 million for capital expenditures.  

Financing Activities — Continuing Operations  

Debt  

At December 31, 2016, total outstanding debt was $3,325 million, compared to $3,626 million at December 31, 2015, all of which was senior debt. The decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes, partially offset by the issuance of the 2026 Notes. At December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility. Accordingly, we had the full availability of our $1 billion facility for future borrowings. We also had $402 million of outstanding standby letters of credit with financial institutions covering performance and financial guarantees per contractual requirements with certain customers at December 31, 2016. These standby letters of credit may be drawn upon in the event that we do not perform on certain of our contractual requirements. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding debt matures between October 15, 2019 and December 15, 2026. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the components of our debt at December 31, 2016.  

We consider our credit rating as an important element of our capital allocation strategy and, while no assurances can be given, we intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating. On April 8, 2016, Standard and Poors changed our rating outlook to stable from negative and affirmed our BBB-senior unsecured rating. On November 1, 2016, Moodys Investors Service changed our rating outlook to stable from negative and affirmed our Baa3 senior unsecured rating. 

Debt Issuances 

The terms of each of the outstanding Senior Notes issued by L3 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 are presented in the table below. There were no debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the redemption provisions of our outstanding Senior Notes. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On December 5, 2016, we issued the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes were issued at a bond discount of $3 million. The net cash proceeds of $542 million from the offering plus cash on hand were used primarily to: (1) replenish the amount of cash used, and the amount of revolving credit borrowings drawn, to repay the 2016 Notes, and (2) redeem the 2017 Notes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Repurchases, Redemptions and Maturities of Senior Notes  

The repurchases, redemptions and maturities of Senior Notes are presented in the table below. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the redemption provisions of our outstanding Senior Notes.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (2)The 3.95% Senior Notes due 2016 were redeemed at a price equal to 101.475% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest ceased to accrue on and after May 20, 2016 and the only remaining right of holders of such Notes was to receive payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest.

 (3)In 2005, we sold $700 million of 3% Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES) due August 1, 2035. On February 2, 2011, we repurchased approximately $11 million of the CODES. The conversion value of CODES of $935 million was calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the CODES. We settled the entire conversion value with respect to converted CODES in cash. As a result of the conversion, we recorded a reduction to shareholders’ equity of $161 million, related to the excess conversion value over the fair value of the debt component of the CODES, net of deferred tax liability. Interest expense recognized for the CODES was $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

Debt Covenants and Other Provisions. The Credit Facility and Senior Notes contain financial and/or other restrictive covenants. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt and related financial covenants and cross default provisions. We were in compliance with our financial and other restrictive covenants at December 31, 2016.  

Guarantees. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L3 and by substantially all of the material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries of L3 on an unsecured senior basis. The payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured senior basis, jointly and severally, by L3s material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of its other indebtedness. The guarantees of the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes rank pari passu with each other.  

Equity  

During 2016 and 2015, L3s Board of Directors authorized the following quarterly cash dividends:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)During the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $220 million of cash dividends. Payments of previously accrued dividends for employee held stock awards were offset by accrued dividends to be paid in future periods.

 (2)During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $214 million of cash dividends, including $1 million of previously accrued dividends for employee held stock awards.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

L3 repurchased $373 million, or 3.0 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016, $740 million, or 6.4 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $823 million, or 6.9 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2014.  

L3 announced, on February 13, 2017, that its Board of Directors had increased L3s regular quarterly cash dividend by 7% to $0.75 per share, payable on March 15, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2017.  

The number of holders of record of L3s common stock, on February 17, 2017, was 176,555. On February 17, 2017, the closing price of L3s common stock, as reported by the NYSE, was $168.23 per share.  

Contractual Obligations  

The table below presents our estimated total contractual obligations from our continuing operations at December 31, 2016, including the amounts expected to be paid or settled for each of the periods indicated below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)Represents principal amount of debt and only includes scheduled principal payments.

 (2)Represents expected interest payments on L3’s debt balance at December 31, 2016 using the stated interest rate on our fixed rate debt, assuming that current borrowings remain outstanding to the contractual maturity date. 

 (3)Non-cancelable operating leases are presented net of estimated sublease rental income. 

 (4)Includes the residual value guarantee for three real estate lease agreements, expiring on August 31, 2020, that are accounted for as operating leases. We have the right to exercise options under the lease agreements to renew the leases, to purchase the properties for $45 million or sell the properties on behalf of the lessor. If we elect to sell the properties, we must pay the lessor a residual value guarantee of $39 million. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases. 

 (5)Represents open purchase orders at December 31, 2016 for amounts expected to be paid for goods or services that are legally binding. 

 (6)Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of workers compensation and deferred compensation for the years ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter and also include pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions that we expect to pay in 2017. 

 (7)Our pension and postretirement benefit plan funding policy is generally to contribute in accordance with cost accounting standards that affect government contractors, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereon. For 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans and approximately $10 million to our postretirement benefit plans. Due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension and postretirement benefit plan funding, we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of one year and we may decide or be required to contribute more than we expect to our pension and postretirement benefit plans. 

 (8)Excludes all income tax obligations, a portion of which represents unrecognized tax benefits in connection with uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken on our income tax returns as of December 31, 2016 since we cannot determine the time period of future tax consequences. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 

We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset  

57  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

agreement. The costs to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The ability to recover investments that we make are generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2016, the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled $1.3 billion, which primarily relate to our Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems segments, some of which extend through 2028. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2016 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $104 million at December 31, 2016, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The table below presents our estimated total contingent commitments and other guarantees at December 31, 2016, including the amounts expected to be paid or settled for each of the periods indicated below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)Represents outstanding letters of credit with financial institutions covering performance and financial guarantees per contractual requirements with certain customers. These letters of credit may be drawn upon in the event of L3’s nonperformance. 

 (2)Represents the minimum guarantees made by L3 or the lessee under the purchase option for certain operating leases in which the lease renewal is not exercised (see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of these guarantees). 

 (3)The total amount does not include residual value guarantees for two real estate lease agreements, expiring on August 31, 2020, that are accounted for as operating leases. We have the right to exercise options under the lease agreements to purchase both properties for $45 million on or before August 31, 2020. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases. 

 (4)The total amount does not include the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the future potential earn-out payments relating to the L3 MacDonald Humfrey acquisition. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value of the contingent consideration.

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  

We are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the U.S. Government and, to a lesser degree, under foreign government contracts, some of which are funded by the U.S. Government. All such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, and, periodically, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations, an indictment by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. A conviction, or an administrative finding that satisfies the requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We are currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations, none of which we anticipate will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. Also, we have been periodically subject to litigation, government investigations, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business. We accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For a description of our legal proceedings and contingencies, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

We continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost that we will incur to comply with these laws, based upon available  

58  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries, if any, there are no environmental loss contingencies that, in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Derivative Financial Instruments and Other Market Risk  

Included in our derivative financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts. All of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading.  

Interest Rate Risk. Our Credit Facility is subject to variable interest and is therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. The interest rates on the Senior Notes are fixed-rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates. Additional data on our debt obligations and our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we would pay on borrowings under the Credit Facility, if any, are provided in Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. Our U.S. and foreign businesses enter into contracts with customers, subcontractors or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. To protect the functional currency equivalent cash flows associated with certain of these contracts, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are generally designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2016, our foreign currency forward contracts had maturities ranging through 2021, a notional value of $358 million and a corresponding net fair value that was an asset of $6 million.  

Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented  

For a discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Inflation  

The effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant. Although a majority of our sales are made under long-term contracts (revenue arrangements), the selling prices of such contracts, established for deliveries in the future, generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods. In addition, some of our contracts provide for price adjustments through cost escalation clauses.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations, cash flows, financial position, economic performance and financial condition, including in particular, the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.  

All statements other than historical facts may be forward-looking statements, such as may, will, should, likely, projects, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. We caution investors that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: our dependence on the defense industry; backlog processing and program slips resulting from delayed awards and/or funding from the DoD and other major customers; the U.S. Government fiscal situation; changes in DoD budget levels and spending priorities; U.S. Government failure to raise the debt ceiling; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of customers and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding many of our contracts; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts; our ability to successfully compete for and win new business; or, identify, acquire and integrate additional businesses; our ability to maintain and improve our operating margin; the availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; the outcome of litigation matters; results of audits by U.S. Government agencies and of ongoing governmental investigations; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements and actions taken by rating agencies that could result in a downgrade of our debt; our ability to continue to recruit, retain and train our

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

employees; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and equity based compensation, as well as the market performance of benefit plan assets; our collective bargaining agreements; our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; global economic uncertainty; the DoDs Better Buying Power and other efficiency initiatives; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our ability to perform contracts on schedule; our international operations including currency risks and compliance with foreign laws; our extensive use of fixed-price type revenue arrangements; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in which our businesses participate; risks relating to technology and data security; our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; our ability to predict the level of participation in, and the related costs our voluntary return program for certain EoTech holographic weapons sight products, and our ability to change and terminate the voluntary return program at our discretion; the impact on our business of improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners; goodwill impairments and the fair values of our assets; and the ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations.  

In addition, for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors and Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements, in each case included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and any material updates to these factors contained in any of our future filings.  

Readers of this document are cautioned that our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.  

As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this filing, to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.
