PART I

Item 1. Business

CSX Corporation (“CSX”), and together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation suppliers. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers.

CSX Transportation, Inc.

CSX’s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000 route mile rail network, which serves major population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Company’s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to approximately 240 short-line and regional railroads.

Lines of Business

During 2011, CSXT’s transportation services generated $11.7 billion of revenue and served three primary lines of business:

Other revenue accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s total revenue in 2011. This revenue category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads, demurrage, revenue for customer volume commitments not met, switching and other incidental charges. Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held beyond a specified period of time. Switching revenue is primarily generated when CSXT switches cars for a customer or another railroad.

Other Entities

In addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (“CSX Intermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States and also performs drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain CSXT customers and trucking dispatch operations. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. Today, the biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, for example minerals and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.

CSX’s other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the Company’s real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. These activities are classified in other income because they are not considered by the Company to be operating activities. Results of these activities fluctuate with the timing of non-operating real estate sales.

Financial Information

Company History

A leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”) – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation.

Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.

CSX was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.

Competition

The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation.

PART I

CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Regulatory Environment

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the United States. The railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, which includes CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. Additionally, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications.

Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the Company's subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision, the STB has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices, including some railroad rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of services and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. This includes jurisdiction over freight car charges, the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic, conditions of service and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers.

In 2008, Congress enacted the Rail Safety Improvement Act (the “RSIA”). The legislation includes a mandate that all Class I freight railroads implement a positive train control system (“PTC”) by December 31, 2015. The AAR recently advised the FRA on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable PTC network cannot be completed by the December 31, 2015 deadline. Federal legislation introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would, if approved, delay the final implementation of PTC from three to five years.

PTC must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials are transported. Implementation of a PTC system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work-zone limits, and train diversions onto another set of tracks caused by switches left in wrong positions. The Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC as well as related ongoing operating expenses. CSX previously estimated that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation would be at least $1.2 billion for the Company. This estimate is currently being re-evaluated due to upward pressure on these costs.

In December 2009, a proposed bill called the “Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2009” was introduced in the Senate but not advanced. In January 2011, the bill, now referred to as the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2011 (“STB Reauthorization Bill”) was reintroduced. The STB Reauthorization Bill, if adopted, could increase government involvement in railroad pricing, service and operations. The proposed legislation also includes provisions that would reduce a railroad's ability to price at market levels and open a carrier's privately-owned and maintained rail network to competitors under certain conditions. Though unlikely, portions of the STB Reauthorization bill may be considered as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, a bill to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.

PART I

If adopted as proposed, this bill could have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenue and operations, as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. Prior to the reintroduction of the STB Reauthorization Bill, the STB had already announced two new hearings; one held in February 2011 to review the utility of boxcar, intermodal, automotive and other exemptions, and the other held in June 2011 to explore the current state of competition in the railroad industry. The STB has not yet announced what actions, if any, it will take in response to the records developed in these hearings.
