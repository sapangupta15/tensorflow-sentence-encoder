[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•LOCAL MEDIA: The Local Media segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company’s 29 owned broadcast television stations; and CBS Local Digital Media™, which operates local Websites including content from the Company’s television stations.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, contributions to the Company’s consolidated revenues from its segments were as follows: Entertainment 67%, Cable Networks 18%, Publishing 6% and Local Media 12%. The Company generated approximately 15% of its total revenues from international regions in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 51% and 14% of total international revenues of approximately $2.02 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively.

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences, and to generate both advertising and non‑advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company continues to increase its investment in premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting its content on multiple digital platforms, including the Company’s owned digital streaming services, as well as third-party live television streaming offerings; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), including cable, direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”), telephone company, and other distributors, for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (also known as “retransmission fees”) and cable networks, and securing compensation from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees” also known as “reverse compensation”). The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits.

On November 17, 2017, the Company completed the disposition of its radio business, CBS Radio Inc. and its subsidiaries (“CBS Radio”), in a transaction which involved the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer followed by the merger of CBS Radio with a subsidiary of Entercom Communications Corp. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

The Company competes with many different entities and media in various markets worldwide. In addition to competition in each of its businesses, the Company competes for opportunities in the entertainment business with other diversified entertainment companies such as The Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal Media, LLC, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and Time Warner Inc.

As of December 31, 2017, National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”), a closely held corporation that owns and operates approximately 945 movie screens in the U.S., the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and South America and manages 2 movie screens in South America, directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.5% of the Company’s voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately 10.2% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.

The Company was organized in Delaware in 1986. The Company’s principal offices are located at 51 W. 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019. Its telephone number is (212) 975-4321 and its Website address is www.cbscorporation.com.

CBS CORP. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Entertainment (67% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, and 55%, 53% and 51% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively)

The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network; CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution, the Company’s television production and syndication operations; Network Ten, the Company’s commercial broadcast network in Australia; CBS Interactive, the Company’s online content networks for information and entertainment; CBS Films, the Company’s producer and distributor of theatrical motion pictures; and the Company’s digital streaming services, CBS All Access and CBSN.

Television Network. The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment™, CBS News® and CBS Sports® distributes a comprehensive schedule of news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 15 of the Company’s owned and operated television stations, and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories.

The CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sale of advertising time for its network broadcasts. A significant portion of the sale of advertising spots for the network’s non-sports programming occurs annually generally during May through July in the industry’s upfront advertising market for the upcoming television broadcast season, which runs for one year generally commencing in mid-September. Advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming in the scatter advertising market. Overall advertising revenue for the network is also impacted by audience ratings for its programming. The Company offers dynamic advertising insertions for the CBS Television Network’s on-demand programming which allow the Company to change advertisements at any time within such programming and offer advertisers greater audience reach. In addition, the CBS Television Network’s revenues include station affiliation fees.

CBS Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and drama series, reality‑based programming, specials, children’s programs, daytime dramas, game shows and late-night programs such as The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS Television 

I-2

Network and CBS News Radio™ with regularly scheduled news and public affairs broadcasts, including 60 Minutes, 48 Hours, CBS Evening News, CBS This Morning, CBS Sunday Morning and Face the Nation as well as special reports. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath®, a television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to the CBS Television Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts on the television network include The NFL Today; certain PGA Tour Golf Tournaments, the Masters and the PGA Championship; certain games from the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament through 2032; regular-season college basketball games; regular-season college football games, including games from the Southeastern Conference and the NFL’s American Football Conference (AFC) regular-season, post-season wild card playoff, divisional playoff and championship games. In 2017, CBS broadcast certain AFC games under its agreement with the NFL to broadcast the AFC package through the 2022 season, which also includes certain National Football Conference regular season games and the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks. The Company’s most recent Super Bowl broadcast was in 2016 and the next broadcast will be in 2019. The Company produced and broadcast certain NFL Thursday Night Football games for the 2017 season.

CBS Television Network content also is exhibited via the internet, including through CBS.com™; CBSSports.com™ and related software applications (“apps”); CBSN, the Company’s live digital streaming advertiser-supported news network available 24 hours a day, seven days a week; CBS All Access, the Company’s digital streaming subscription service which includes a commercial-free option for on-demand content; and digital television streaming services, such as DIRECTV NOW, fuboTV, Hulu with Live TV, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV. CBS All Access offers both current and library programming as well as original series, such as The Good Fight, Star Trek: Discovery and No Activity, and CBSN’s live and original reporting. Live, local NFL games broadcast by the CBS Television Network are streamed on certain CBS All Access platforms under the Company’s multi-year deal with the NFL. Digital streaming services such as CBS All Access and CBSN are also known as “over-the-top,” “OTT” or “direct-to-consumer” services which provide video content via the internet to users without payment to a traditional MVPD. CBS All Access and CBSN are available at CBS.com and CBSNews.com™, respectively, and/or through CBS apps on multiple digital platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon Fire and Windows 10 mobile platforms, and Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, Amazon Channels, Chromecast, PlayStation, Roku, Samsung Smart TVs and Xbox connected device platforms, among others. During 2017, the CBS Television Network broadcast the Tony Awards®, the Kennedy Center Honors, and the Grammy Awards®. The Company won 18 awards at the 44th Annual Daytime Emmy® Awards in May 2017. 

The CW, a broadcast network and the Company’s 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, airs programming, including Jane the Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Dynasty, Supergirl and The Flash. Eight of the Company’s owned television stations are affiliates of The CW. Certain of The CW’s series are streamed on Netflix, a subscription video-on-demand service. The CW programming is also available via The CW app on multiple digital platforms, including Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Xbox and mobile devices.

Television Production and Syndication. CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution produce, acquire and/or distribute programming worldwide, including series, specials, news and public affairs, and generate revenue principally from the licensing and distribution of such programming. The programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services, streaming services or distribution via first‑run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The Company subsequently distributes programming after its initial exhibition on a network, basic cable network or premium subscription service for domestic exhibition on television stations, cable networks or streaming services (known as “off-network syndicated programming”). Off-network syndicated programming and first‑run syndicated programming distributed domestically, as well as programming distributed internationally, can sometimes be sold in successive cycles of sales known as “first cycle,” “second cycle” sales, and so on, which may occur on exclusive or non-exclusive bases. Generally, license fees may decrease with successive sales cycles due to increased program exhibitions.

I-3

Programming that was produced or co-produced by the Company’s production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others, Seal Team (CBS), NCIS (CBS), Bull (CBS), Kevin Can Wait (CBS), Madam Secretary (CBS), Scorpion (CBS), Criminal Minds (CBS) and Jane the Virgin (The CW). Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period. Remaining distribution rights, including international and/or off‑network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or international markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the Company’s objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through various forms of distribution, including international licensing, domestic syndication and digital streaming of episodes. Generally, international sales of network series are made within one year of the U.S. network run and series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic off-network syndication; however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened, particularly for sales to digital streaming services. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series, such as Hawaii Five-O, Criminal Minds, Blue Bloods, Elementary, NCIS, NCIS: Los Angeles and NCIS: New Orleans as well as a library of older television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, Dr. Phil, The Doctors, Rachael Ray, Hot Bench and Judge Judy and produces The Good Fight, Star Trek: Discovery and No Activity for streaming on CBS All Access. The Company also distributes syndicated and other programming internationally.

The Company continues to monetize its content through digital media. It enters into and renews numerous multi-year licensing agreements for distribution of certain of its programming to various services reaching countries throughout the world, particularly the U.S., Canada and in Europe. These services include the digital streaming on subscription or advertiser supported video-on-demand services, including services by Amazon, Bell Media, Netflix, Stan Entertainment and Telefonica; broadband pay television services, including AT&T’s DIRECTV NOW, fuboTV, Hulu with Live TV, Sony’s PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV; and the digital downloading on various electronic sell-through services owned by Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, among others.

Fees for television programming licensed for syndication and digital streaming are recorded as revenues at the beginning of the license period in which the programs are made available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in the Entertainment segment’s operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $670 million and $749 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

In November 2017, the Company acquired Ten Network Holdings Limited, one of three major commercial broadcast networks in Australia, including the channels TEN®, ONE® and ELEVEN® which broadcast a mix of news, sports and entertainment programming, together with the digital platform tenplay®. Network Ten principally derives revenue from the sale of advertising for its network broadcasts and related digital services. The Company also has interests in domestic and international joint ventures. The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Lionsgate, which owns and operates the entertainment cable network, Pop®. The Company owns a 49% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of AMC Networks Inc., which owns and operates channels in the U.K. and Ireland, including CBS Action™, CBS Drama™, CBS Reality™ and Horror Channel™. The Company also owns a 30% interest in a joint venture with another subsidiary of AMC Networks, which owns and operates cable and satellite channels in Europe, the Middle East and Africa broadcasting CBS programming and branded as CBS Action, CBS Reality and CBS Europa™.

I-4

CBS Interactive generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising and sponsorships, in addition to fees derived from search and commerce partners, licensing fees, subscriptions, e-commerce activities, and other paid services. Advertising spending on the internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly with economic conditions. In addition, online marketing spending follows seasonal consumer behavior throughout the calendar year to reflect trends during the calendar year.

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to launch CBS Sports HQ™, a live digital streaming advertiser-supported sports news and highlights network available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

CBS Interactive also operates CBS.com, the online destination for CBS Television Network programming. Further extending the CBS.com experience, the Company offers a CBS app for on-demand streaming of various programs from the Company’s current network and library programming to users on multiple digital platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon Fire and Windows 10 mobile platforms, and Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, Amazon Channels, Chromecast, PlayStation, Roku, Samsung Smart TVs and Xbox connected device platforms, among others.

CBS All Access offers an on-demand selection of both current and library programming and original series, such as The Good Fight, Star Trek: Discovery and No Activity, CBSN’s live and original reporting as well as the ability to stream live programming from local CBS Television Stations and certain CBS television station affiliates. Also, live, local NFL games broadcast by the CBS Television Network are streamed on certain CBS All Access platforms. CBS All Access is available at CBS.com and on the multiple digital platforms described above through the CBS app and is scheduled to commence during the first half of 2018 in Canada. CBS Interactive also operates CBSN, a live digital streaming advertiser-supported news network available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CBSN is available at CBSNews.com and on the multiple digital platforms described above through the CBS News app. Through the CBS Audience Network™, the Company delivers video content from its digital properties and television stations and affiliated television stations under an advertiser-supported distribution model to third-party digital properties. The growing slate of the Company’s content available online includes full episodes, clips and highlights based on CBS, CBS Sports Network and Showtime Networks programming as well as original made-for-the-Web content.

CBS Films. CBS Films produces, acquires and distributes theatrical motion pictures across all genres. The budget for each picture is intended to be up to $50 million (or, in certain cases, higher where a co-financing partner is involved) plus advertising and marketing costs at a level consistent with industry custom. The majority of motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films is intended for a wide, commercial theatrical release, similar to motion pictures typically produced and released by major studios. CBS Films’ theatrical releases in 2017 were Dean, The Sense of An Ending and American Assassin.

In general, motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films are exhibited theatrically in the U.S. and internationally, followed by exploitation via home entertainment (including DVDs and Blu-ray Discs and electronic rental and sell-through), video-on-demand, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and basic cable, digital media 

I-5

outlets, including subscription video-on-demand, and, in some cases, other channels such as airlines and hotels. CBS Films exploits its motion pictures (including certain ancillary rights such as licensing and merchandising) and generates revenues in all media in the relevant release windows either directly, through affiliated CBS entities, or via third-party distribution arrangements, including CBS Films’ multi-year agreement with Lions Gate Films, which was extended in November 2017, for Lions Gate Films to distribute CBS Films’ new wide-release motion pictures in all media, except U.S. pay television.

Entertainment Competition.

Television Network. The broadcast television environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in broadcast television are the development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks, such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, independent television stations, cable program services, as well as other media, including DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, digital program services, such as Netflix and Hulu, print and the internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience.

Television Production and Syndication. As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups, and independent producers and syndicators, such as Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony and Warner Bros., to produce and sell programming both domestically and internationally. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company’s entertainment businesses.

CBS Interactive. CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including the following: general purpose portals, such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing; online comparison shopping and retail properties, including Amazon.com; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive’s brands serve, such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, entertainment and lifestyle focused digital properties; other content sites and apps, such as ESPN.com, HBO GO, Hulu and Netflix, as well as major television broadcast company digital properties, including digital streaming services and apps; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media companies that provide both online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.

CBS Films. Motion picture production and distribution is a highly competitive business. During the life cycle of the development and production of a motion picture project, CBS Films must compete for the rights to compelling underlying source material and talent such as writers, producers, directors, on-screen performers and other creative personnel. CBS Films must also compete with other buyers for the acquisition of third-party produced motion pictures. Once a motion picture is completed or acquired, CBS Films must compete with numerous other motion pictures produced and/or distributed by various studios and independent producers, including Paramount Pictures Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment, STX Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., Lakeshore Entertainment Group, and digital program services, such as Netflix, among others, for audience acceptance as well as limited exhibition outlets across all of the relevant release windows. In addition, the ultimate consumer has many options for entertainment other than motion pictures including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities.

I-6

Cable Networks (18%, 16% and 18% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 35%, 33% and 37% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively)

The Cable Networks segment is composed of Showtime Networks, which operates the Company’s premium subscription program services, including a digital streaming subscription offering; CBS Sports Network, the Company’s cable network focused on college athletics and other sports; and Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel and a digital streaming subscription service.

Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks owns and operates three commercial-free, premium subscription program services in the U.S.: Showtime, offering original series, recently released theatrical feature films, documentaries, boxing and other sports-related programming, and special events; The Movie Channel, offering recently released theatrical feature films and related programming; and Flix, offering theatrical feature films primarily from the last several decades; and a digital streaming subscription offering of the Showtime service. At December 31, 2017, subscriptions to Showtime (including its digital streaming subscription offering) totaled approximately 25 million in the U.S., certain U.S. territories and Bermuda.

The Showtime digital streaming subscription offering allows subscribers to view on-demand programming as well as the live telecast of the east and west coast feeds of Showtime, and is available for purchase (without a traditional MVPD video subscription) at showtime.com™, through the Showtime app on multiple digital platforms, including Apple, Android and Roku devices, and as an add-on subscription to Amazon Prime, DIRECTV NOW, fuboTV, Hulu, Sony’s PlayStation Vue, Sling TV and YouTube TV. Showtime Networks also makes Showtime Anytime®, an authenticated version of Showtime, available at showtimeanytime.com™ and, via certain internet-connected devices, through a Showtime Anytime app, free of charge to Showtime subscribers as part of their Showtime subscription through participating Showtime Networks’ distributors. Showtime Anytime enables Showtime subscribers to view on-demand programming as well as the live telecast of the east and west coast feeds of Showtime. Versions of Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix are also available on-demand, enabling traditional television subscribers to watch individual programs at their convenience. Showtime Networks additionally operates the Website SHO.com™ which promotes Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix programming, and provides information and entertainment and other services. 

Showtime Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous MVPDs, with a substantial portion of such revenue coming from three of the largest such distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for Showtime and The Movie Channel, from motion picture studios and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations, including exclusive motion picture output agreements with CBS Films, Open Road Films, STX Entertainment, Amblin Partners and IFC Films. Showtime Networks’ original series telecast in 2017 included Ray Donovan, Billions, SMILF, The Affair, The Circus, I’m Dying Up Here, Shameless and Twin Peaks, among others. In 2017, Showtime Networks also telecast documentaries, such as Becoming Cary Grant, Whitney: Can I Be Me and George Michael: Freedom, and various sports-related programs, including Inside the NFL and A Season With Navy Football. Showtime Networks also produces and/or provides special events on a pay-per-view basis, including Floyd Mayweather’s pay-per-view boxing match against Conor McGregor in August 2017.

Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of its original programming. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with television networks, internet content distributors, such as Amazon and Netflix, and/or other media companies for the exhibition of certain Showtime original programming domestically and in various international territories. For example, the Company has output agreements, including with Bell Media Inc. for Canada, with Sky-affiliated entities for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the U.K., and with Moviestar + for Spain. During 2017, Showtime Networks entered into output agreements with Canal + Group for France, Fox Networks Group Asia for Southeast Asia, and Hotstar’s streaming service for India.

I-7

Showtime Networks also owns a majority of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel, a basic cable service in the U.S., featuring programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature. Smithsonian Networks makes Smithsonian Channel content available on an on-demand and authenticated basis to certain distributors in the U.S. and licenses Smithsonian Channel content outside of the U.S., including in connection with Smithsonian Channel in Canada, in which Smithsonian Networks owns a minority interest. In addition, Smithsonian Networks operates Smithsonian Channel in Singapore. Smithsonian Networks also operates the Website SmithsonianChannel.com™ and various apps, which promote Smithsonian Channel programming and provide information and entertainment services. 

CBS Sports Network. CBS Sports Network is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week cable program service that provides sports and related content, with a strong focus on college sports. The network televises over 700 live professional, amateur and collegiate events annually, highlighted by Division I college football, basketball, hockey and lacrosse, as well as professional bull riding (PBR), professional lacrosse (MLL), arena football (AFL), Tough Mudder, CrossFit and various styles of motor sports events (including asphalt, dirt, and off road racing). In addition, the network showcases a variety of original programming, including documentaries, features and studio shows, highlighted by NFL Monday QB, That Other Pre-Game Show (TOPS), Inside College Basketball, Inside College Football, Time to Schein and a first of its kind all-female panel talk show, We Need to Talk. CBS Sports Network also provides ancillary coverage for CBS Sports relating to major events, such as the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, Masters Tournament and PGA Championship, and for Showtime Networks relating to Showtime Championship Boxing. CBS Sports Network produces weekday simulcasts of the radio shows The Morning Show with Boomer and Gio, Tiki and Tierney and, commencing in January 2018, The Jim Rome Show. Further, CBS Sports Network televises a diverse slate of additional programming under the CBS Sports Spectacular™ brand, including mixed martial arts, skiing, bowling, surfing, boxing, horse racing, volleyball and cheerleading, among other events. CBS Sports Network had approximately 52 million subscribers as of December 31, 2017. The network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising. CBS Sports Network has secured carriage arrangements with the top MVPDs. The Company also has agreements for the digital streaming of CBS Sports Network programming on several digital streaming services, including fuboTV, Hulu with Live TV, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV.

Cable Networks Competition.

Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the U.S., including Home Box Office, Inc. and Starz, LLC. Competition among these premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks’ premium subscription program services to subscribers. In addition, Showtime Networks competes with non-traditional subscription programming services delivered via the internet, such as Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, for original programming, theatrical motion pictures and viewership. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with basic cable program services, broadcast television and other media, including video games and other internet apps.

Smithsonian Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non‑fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media.

CBS Sports Network. CBS Sports Network principally competes with cable programming services, including other sports‑oriented cable programming services, for distribution and license fee revenue among MVPDs, as well as for viewership and advertising revenue. The effects of consolidation among MVPDs and consumer pricing sensitivity have made it more difficult for niche channels to secure broad distribution in mainstream programming packages. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for sports programming services which 

I-8

have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration or acceptance. CBS Sports Network continues its repositioning to be included in programming packages with more subscribers. Re-alignment of college athletic conferences and their member institutions may adversely impact CBS Sports Network’s programming arrangements. CBS Sports Network also competes with cable programming services generally, including other sports programming services, such as ESPN, FOX Sports Networks and NBC Sports Network, in acquiring the television and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.

The terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company’s subscription program services are important to the Company. The effects of industry consolidation and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach and maintain favorable terms and positioning, which could increase costs and have an adverse effect on revenues.

Publishing (6% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, and 5%, 4% and 4% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively)

The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster, which publishes and distributes consumer books in the U.S. and internationally.

Simon & Schuster publishes and distributes adult and children’s consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats in the U.S. and internationally. Its digital formats include electronic books and audio books. Simon & Schuster’s major adult imprints include Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner, Atria Books, Gallery Books, Touchstone and Howard Books®. Simon & Schuster’s major children’s imprints include Simon Pulse®, Aladdin®, Atheneum Books for Young Readers®, Margaret K. McElderry Books™, Saga Press™ and Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers™. Simon & Schuster also develops special imprints and publishes titles based on the products of certain CBS businesses as well as those of third parties and distributes products for other publishers. Simon & Schuster distributes its products directly and through third parties. Simon & Schuster also delivers content and promotes its products on its own Websites, social media, general internet sites as well as those dedicated to individual titles. Its created assets include online videos showcasing Simon & Schuster authors and new releases on AOL, YouTube, Amazon, Bio.com, MSN.com, Google Newsstand, iTunes, SimonandSchuster.com and other sites. International publishing includes the international distribution of English-language titles through Simon & Schuster UK, Simon & Schuster Canada, Simon & Schuster Australia, Simon & Schuster India and other distributors, as well as the publication of locally originated titles by its international companies.

In 2017, Simon & Schuster had 195 New York Times bestsellers in hardcover, paperback and electronic formats, collectively, including 30 New York Times #1 bestsellers. Best-selling titles in 2017 include What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sleeping Beauties by Stephen King and Owen King, and Leonardo DaVinci by Walter Isaacson. Best-selling children’s titles include Dork Diaries 12: Tales from a Not-So-Secret Crush Catastrophe by Rachel Renée Russell, Lord of Shadows by Cassandra Clare, and It Takes a Village by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Simon & Schuster Digital™, through SimonandSchuster.com, publishes original content, builds reader communities and promotes and sells Simon & Schuster’s books over the internet.

The consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end‑of‑year holiday season. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster’s sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster’s top two accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. In 2017, the sale of digital content represented approximately 22% of Simon & Schuster’s revenues. The Company expects that electronic books will continue to represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming years. 

Publishing Competition. The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected over the years by consolidation trends and electronic distribution methods and models. Mass merchandisers and on‑line

retailers are significant factors in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. The growth of the electronic book market has impacted print book retailers and wholesalers and could result in a reduction of these channels for the sales and marketing of the Company’s books. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions and competition may adversely affect book retailers’ operations, including distribution of the Company’s books. The Company must compete with other larger publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Hachette and HarperCollins, for the rights to works by authors and sales to retailers and customers. Competition is particularly strong for well‑known authors and public personalities. In addition, technological changes have made it increasingly possible for authors to self‑publish and have led to the development of new digital distribution models in which the Company’s books must compete with the availability of both a larger volume of books as well as non‑book content.

Local Media (12%, 14% and 12% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 18%, 22% and 19% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively)

The Local Media segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company’s 29 owned broadcast television stations, all of which operate under licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The licenses are renewable every eight years. The Company’s television stations are located in the 5 largest, and 15 of the top 20, television markets in the U.S. The Company owns multiple television stations within the same designated market area (“DMA”) in 10 major markets. These multiple station markets are: New York (market #1), Los Angeles (market #2), Philadelphia (market #4), Dallas-Fort Worth (market #5), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (market #8), Boston (market #10), Detroit (market #14), Miami-Ft. Lauderdale (market #16), Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto (market #20), and Pittsburgh (market #24). This group of television stations enables the Company to reach a wide audience within and across geographically diverse markets in the U.S. The stations produce news and broadcast public affairs, sports and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS, The CW or MyNetworkTV programming and syndicated programming. 

The CBS Television Stations group principally derives its revenues from the sale of advertising time on its television stations. In addition, the CBS Television Stations group receives retransmission fees from MVPDs for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations. The Company also has agreements for the digital streaming of the Company’s owned television stations on several digital streaming services, including DIRECTV NOW, fuboTV, Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV. The Company’s digital streaming subscription service, CBS All Access, offers an extensive on-demand selection of both current programming and library, original series as well as the ability to stream live programming from local CBS Television Stations and certain CBS television station affiliates. CBS All Access is available at CBS.com and through the CBS app on multiple digital platforms. The Company’s television stations have a digital presence on CBS Local Websites which are operated by CBS Local Digital Media. The CBS Local Websites and related apps promote the Company’s stations’ programming as well as provide live and on-demand news, traffic, weather, entertainment and sports information, among other services for their local communities. The CBS Local Websites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising. The “Television Stations and CBS Local Digital Media Websites” table below includes information with respect to these properties within U.S. television markets. CBS Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting own and operate through an approximately 50/50 joint venture DECADES™, a national entertainment program service featuring classic television content, movies and original programming for local television stations’ digital sub-channels, which utilize a local television station's available broadcast spectrum to provide a companion to that station's primary channel.

Local Media Competition. Television stations compete for programming, on‑air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The owned and operated television stations’ competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal. The Company’s television stations face increasing competition from technologies such as audio and visual content 

I-10

delivered via the internet, which create new ways for audiences to consume content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertising. The Company’s television stations’ Websites face competition for advertisers and visitors from other digital sources of local content.

REGULATION

The Company’s businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S. and of national, regional and local authorities in foreign countries. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company’s businesses.

Intellectual Property and Privacy

Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See “Intellectual Property” on page I-15 for more information on the Company’s brands).

Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy. Unauthorized distribution, reproduction or display of copyrighted material in digital formats without regard to content owners’ copyright rights in television programming, motion pictures, video clips and books, such as through pirated DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, unauthorized stored copies and live streaming, internet downloads, file “sharing” and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property. The Company’s digital delivery services and commercial arrangements with digital content providers help reduce the risks associated with unauthorized access to its content. The Company is also engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and participates in various litigation, public relations programs and legislative activity. These business strategies and enforcement efforts are dependent upon laws and practices that protect the rights of creators and authorized distributors of content.

Laws and Content. The Company derives revenues from the creation and exploitation of creative content, for which the copyright law, including in the U.S. and other laws in other jurisdictions, grants certain exclusive rights, including to reproduce, publicly perform and distribute such content. The duration of the protection afforded to the Company’s intellectual property depends on the type of property and the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction. Any changes to copyright laws or related regulations that enable the Company to control the distribution of its content, including through court decisions, which diminish the scope of a copyright owner’s exclusive rights, could impact the Company. Proposed legal amendments, such as to the law governing territorial exclusivity of the distribution of content in Europe, could adversely impact the Company’s ability to control and distribute its content.

Privacy. The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company’s interactive businesses. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its Websites, digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs.

Broadcasting

General. Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations’ frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.

Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of MVPDs and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.

I-12

Indecency and Profanity Regulation. The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is approximately $397,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $3.7 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material.

License Renewals. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has no pending renewal applications. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending.

License Assignments. The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Third parties may oppose the Company’s applications to assign, transfer or acquire broadcast licenses.

Ownership Regulation. The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have certain official positions or ownership interests, known as “attributable” interests, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition of a broadcast station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC’s ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest.

In November 2017, as part of its quadrennial review of broadcast ownership rules, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration in which it eliminated or modified many of its ownership rules, which are briefly summarized below. 

Local Television Ownership. Under the FCC’s local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top-four ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the FCC. In addition, the FCC will consider whether to permit acquisitions of a second top-four ranked television station in the same market on a case-by-case basis if doing so would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. “Satellite” television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a “parent” television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the “parent” station.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation. Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. In April 2017, the FCC reinstated the UHF discount, pursuant to which a UHF television station is attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation and/or the UHF discount. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households not taking into account the UHF discount.

I-13

Cross-Ownership Rules. In November 2017, The FCC’s Order on Reconsideration eliminated the radio-television cross-ownership rule, which limited the common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market; and eliminated the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule, which generally prohibited the common ownership of a television or radio station and daily newspaper in the same market.

Dual Network Rule. The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.

Attribution of Ownership. Under the FCC’s attribution rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various types of securities of an entity which holds FCC licenses, such as the Company, could violate the foregoing FCC ownership regulations or policies if that purchaser owned or acquired an “attributable” interest in other media properties. Under the FCC’s rules, an “attributable” interest for purposes of the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules generally includes: equity and debt interests which combined exceed 33% of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensee’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest, whether television, radio, cable or newspaper; a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless the interest holder is properly “insulated” from management activities; and any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent. The FCC is reviewing its single majority voting stockholder attribution exemption, which renders as non‑attributable voting interests up to 49% in a licensee controlled by a single majority voting stockholder. Because NAI holds an attributable interest in both the Company and Viacom Inc., the business of each company is attributable to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities”).

Alien Ownership. In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 25% of the voting power or equity of the Company. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold.

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either “must carry” status, pursuant to which the cable system’s carriage of the station is mandatory, or “retransmission consent,” pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company’s owned television stations have elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases and, since 2006, the Company has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.

Similarly, federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect “must carry” or “retransmission consent” status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to cable systems. The Company’s owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements.

Children’s Television Programming. Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I 

I-14

programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display during children’s programming of internet addresses of Websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.

Program Access. Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms or conditions for programming to competing MVPDs unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC’s regulations. The FCC also assesses the competitive impact of exclusive distribution arrangements between vertically integrated cable programmers and cable operators on a complaint-based process, using a case-by-case review. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC’s program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned in whole or in part by either a cable operator or a telephone company that provides video programming directly to subscribers.

The Company’s wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company’s flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.’s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC’s program access rules. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities”).

National Broadband Plan. Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions to reclaim spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. As part of these auctions, which commenced in 2016 and concluded in March 2017, the Company surrendered the spectrum for KCCO-TV, which was a satellite television station of the Company’s television station, WCCO-TV, in Minneapolis. The television stations that continue their operations after the auctions may have to change channels as the FCC “repacks” the remaining spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use. The legislation provides that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas, no UHF band stations will be forced into the VHF band and a fund was established to at least partially reimburse broadcasters for reasonable relocation expenses relating to the spectrum‑repacking.

Broadcast Transmission Standard. In November 2017, the FCC adopted an Order authorizing television broadcasters to voluntarily begin broadcasting in the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0,” subject to certain requirements, including the obligation of high power television stations to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades and will require consumers to obtain new equipment to be able to view ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. It is too early to predict the impact of the ATSC 3.0 transition by television stations on the Company’s operations.
