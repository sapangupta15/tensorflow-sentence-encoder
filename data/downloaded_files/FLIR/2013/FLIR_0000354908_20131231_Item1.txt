ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Overview

FLIR Systems, Inc. (“FLIR,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a world leader in sensor systems that enhance perception and awareness. We were founded in 1978 and have since become a premier designer, manufacturer, and marketer of thermal imaging and other sensing products and systems. Our advanced sensors and integrated sensor systems enable the gathering and analysis of critical information through a wide variety of applications in commercial, industrial, and government markets worldwide. 

Our goal is to both enable our customers to benefit from the valuable information produced by advanced sensing technologies and to deliver sustained superior financial performance for our shareholders. We create value for our customers by improving personal and public safety and security, providing advanced surveillance and tactical defense capabilities, facilitating air, ground, and maritime navigation, enhancing enjoyment of the outdoors, providing infrastructure inefficiency information, conveying preemptive structural deficiency data, displaying process irregularities, and enabling commercial business opportunities through our continual support and development of new thermal imaging data and analytics applications. Our business model meets the needs of a multitude of customers - we sell off-the-shelf products to a wide variety of markets in an efficient, timely, and affordable manner as well as offer a variety of system configurations to suit specific customer requirements. Centered on the design of products for low cost manufacturing and high volume distribution, our commercial operating model has been developed over time and provides us with a unique ability to adapt to market changes and meet our customers’ needs.

Through December 31, 2013, our business was organized into two divisions: Commercial Systems and Government Systems. Within these divisions, we had five reporting segments: Thermal Vision & Measurement and Raymarine, which comprise the Commercial Systems division; and Surveillance, Detection, and Integrated Systems, which make up our Government Systems division. In February 2014, we announced a realignment of our business which results in the elimination of our division structure and the formation of six reporting segments effective January 1, 2014. For purposes of this Report, all business descriptions and financial results are based upon our reporting structure as of December 31, 2013.

Thermal Vision & Measurement (“TVM”) products are generally sold for applications where the customer need is to see at night or in adverse conditions or to image a scene while gathering valuable situational and temperature information. Due to continued reductions in the cost of infrared technology, demand in large untapped commercial markets such as commercial and residential security, transportation, marine, airborne, personal night vision, and first responder markets has grown rapidly. Our TVM products range from highly sensitive cameras with extensive analytic capabilities and sophisticated image processing to less expensive cameras offering a mix of performance and value for less demanding applications. Our infrared sensors business, which sells focal plane arrays and camera cores internally as well as to third parties on an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) basis, is also part of TVM. Revenue from TVM was $727.9 million, which represented 49 percent of consolidated revenue in 2013.

Infrared Technology Overview

Infrared is a portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum that is adjacent to the visible spectrum, but is invisible to the human eye due to its longer wavelengths. Unlike visible light, infrared radiation (or heat) is emitted directly by all objects above absolute zero in temperature. Thermal imaging systems detect this infrared radiation and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then processed into a video signal and displayed on a video screen. Thermal imaging systems are different than other types of “low light” vision systems, such as visible light intensification used in green or gray sighted night vision goggles. Infrared imaging systems are not adversely affected by the presence of visible light, so they can be used day or night, and they are not susceptible to rapid changes in visible light levels. Since infrared systems are detecting emitted infrared radiation, they are passive and thus more covert than certain “active” or “illuminated” infrared systems. Additionally, thermal imaging systems can measure very small temperature differences, a critical feature for a variety of commercial, industrial, and scientific applications.

An infrared detector, which collects or absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electronic signal, is the primary component of thermal imaging systems. The two types of infrared detectors we manufacture and use in our systems are often referred to as “cooled” and “uncooled.” Cooled detectors utilize a mechanical stirling cycle micro-cooler to reduce the operating temperature of the infrared sensor to approximately -200° C, and offer high sensitivity and resolution for long-range applications or those applications requiring high measurement precision. These detectors, while more sensitive and thus able to see farther, result in a product that is more expensive, heavier, more complex, and uses more power than those using uncooled detectors. Uncooled detectors operate at room temperature and thus do not require a micro-cooler, resulting in products that are lighter, use less power and are less expensive to produce than cooled detectors. While the performance of uncooled detectors is improving, uncooled detectors are still less sensitive than cooled detectors. The cost of both types of detectors is declining and we expect to continue reducing costs as volumes rise and the technology advances in the future. We currently expect demand for both types of detectors, or sensors, to increase.

Continually Reduce Costs

Our ability to continue penetrating and expanding on our leading market position and into the markets for advanced sensor systems is predicated on our success at reducing our internal costs to manufacture systems. Through our commercial operating model, we have had great success designing and manufacturing products that benefit from economies of scale and thus reduce our cost to deliver a product to our customers. We expect to further leverage this model and accelerate the virtuous cycle our business has created where increased unit volume output reduces our costs, allowing us to lower selling prices, which increases demand and sales volume for our products. We intend to continue to reduce costs, through continuing to vertically integrate our operations, expanding our use of shared services, and rationalizing our supply chain and our manufacturing operations.

For example, in 2013, we implemented an operational restructuring plan that will result in the closure of six manufacturing and R&D sites, the movement of those operations into other, larger FLIR locations, the consolidation of optics production capabilities and laser manufacturing operations into optics and laser centers of excellence.

Expand Global Reach 

 Expanding and strengthening our already substantial distribution network is vital to our ability to keep pace with demand and the growing adoption of advanced infrared and threat detection systems. Investing in our direct sales force and building relationships with independent distributors and partners globally is a key priority. Developing countries such as Brazil, India, Russia, and China are areas of focus, as they are emerging economies for our technologies. Additionally, as our sensor technologies become more affordable and prevalent in consumer markets, we have worked to strengthen our marketing and sales channels to better communicate with and serve the millions of potential customers that transact over the Internet, through catalogs, and at retail locations.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our TVM products worldwide through a direct sales staff and a network of distributors and representatives as well as retail channels. Our TVM business continues to expand distribution by hiring additional direct sales personnel and expanding third-party distribution networks in specific markets, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and other emerging markets. In certain markets, TVM has chosen to supply camera cores on an OEM basis to companies with well established distribution networks. With our further expansion into the low cost segment of the commercial markets, we have developed greater competencies in market research, electronic marketing, marketing communications, and business development. Our ability to identify new markets, adapt our product solutions to meet unique market needs, quickly develop marketing communications that highlight our unique features, and leverage existing and new distribution channels to develop incremental business are important aspects of our marketing and communications efforts.

TVM carries backlog in certain markets, but the business is less backlog dependent than our Government Systems division’s segments. TVM order backlog, defined as orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months, was $189 million as of December 31, 2013, compared with $158 million at the end of 2012. 

Customers

Typical TVM customers include OEMs, major integrators of security systems, security dealers, utility companies, electrical contractors, maritime dealers, law enforcement agencies, outdoor enthusiasts, building inspectors, damage restoration contractors, universities, numerous commercial enterprises, and increasingly, consumers. The emerging personal vision systems market is becoming increasingly accessible as we leverage our business model to reduce the price of advanced thermal imaging products. This consumer market is a key strategic area of focus given the vast size of the customer base and the opportunities it provides us to expand our volumes and brand name. Given the high-value nature of many of our thermography-related instruments, our thermography products’ revenues tend to be correlated with seasonal trends, in particular capital spending trends. In general, customers in markets like predictive maintenance and R&D are sensitive to the broad economy because our cameras are viewed as capital expenditure items. The sales of our high volume cameras and emerging thermal vision products are somewhat less sensitive to economic cycles due to their lower price points and the growing market awareness of thermal technology. 

Our established distribution network, broad product portfolio, and product and technical development capabilities set a foundation for future success as we continue to leverage our operating model to increase our product volumes and reduce our costs in creating advanced imaging products. As we continue to make our products accessible to a larger population of end-users and build awareness of the advantages of thermal imaging applications, we anticipate our TVM segment will provide significant revenue and profitability for our business.

Competition

Many of the markets that TVM addresses are emerging from the early-adopter environments to broader-based demand, which has attracted competitors. While our market share in thermography products is significant, estimated to be approximately 60 percent based on independent industry research, we view the TVM market as highly competitive, with both large and niche providers of thermal camera equipment. We believe the key drivers of success in these markets are: technological proficiency in imaging sensors, product design and functionality, product quality, product cost, ability to deliver in a timely manner, trustworthy customer service, customer training, distribution reach, brand name, and scalability of operations. We are uniquely positioned to operate in this competitive environment given our demonstrated ability to innovate high-quality sensors at low cost due to our operating model, our advanced research and development capabilities, our established and reliable distribution and service network, our diversified manufacturing operations, and our broad product offering. Our competitors vary market by market, but include divisions of Danaher (Fluke), General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Sofradir, Axis Communications, NEC, Testo, and numerous smaller companies.

Our key strategies for Raymarine include continued investment in R&D to create truly new and innovative products and leveraging our global thermal imaging capabilities into the recreational marine industry, expanding into adjacent markets, and enhancing the integration capabilities of the business through investments in software and networking solutions. While the boating market that Raymarine serves is sizable, the industry has been in a cyclical trough. We believe that recent product developments and operational improvements have positioned the business to benefit significantly as global demand returns to historical levels.

Markets

Recreational Boating OEMsA main focus of Raymarine has been to establish relationships with boat manufacturers in order to sell a fully integrated electronic “backbone” on new boats, with the intention of driving brand continuity with a large installed base of end-users. Medium sized (26 to 45 feet in length) and large boats (in excess of 45 feet in length) have a unique need for sophisticated electronics and multifunction control solutions. Additionally, in recent years, demand has grown for scaled-down instruments in the much larger segment for small boats (comprising inflatable, pontoon and rigid motor craft under 25 feet in length). Raymarine’s comprehensive product offering has evolved to serve well these evolving boat manufacturers’ needs.

AftermarketDue to the comparatively long life of a recreational boat, the growing importance and usefulness of marine electronic equipment and the pace of technological development, the aftermarket is large for electronics systems refits and upgrades. Raymarine has ensured that both our instruments and our networking software are capable of integrating with third party platforms and instruments, which has become a key driver of demand in the aftermarket.

Sales and Distribution

Raymarine’s products are sold through a combination of direct sales, third-party distributors, service partners, and retail outlets. Raymarine has strong relationships with a large number of key boat builder OEMs, most of which are supplied directly with the latest Raymarine systems. 

Raymarine also supplies a global network of retailers, distributors and wholesalers. Many of these partnerships are on an exclusive basis, whereby Raymarine is the only electronic boating equipment stocked. Raymarine also has a global network of dealers and service centers which are able to sell, repair, and install Raymarine’s products. Additionally, the business has established a presence at retail locations and boat shows, which serves to build the Raymarine brand in both the new-build and aftermarket spaces. Having a strong consumer brand name and a large installed base of users created through our first fitments drives business in the aftermarket as boaters look to upgrade or replace instrumentation, often with the brand with which they are familiar.

Raymarine’s backlog as of December 31, 2013, was $7 million. Raymarine is not considered a backlog intensive business, as shipment of product typically occurs within a few weeks of receipt of orders.

Customers

Raymarine sells its products via diverse distribution channels to a wide variety of customers. Raymarine has established long-term relationships with more than 250 OEM boat builders, each of which have experience and knowledge of the product capabilities, quality, and reliability. These OEMs value the breadth of the Raymarine product line and our global dealership service network. We also sell discrete instruments to consumers who are looking to install new or upgrade existing marine electronics on their small, medium, or large boats.

Competition

The maritime electronics markets are intensely competitive with many established brands and companies. We compete with these companies through innovation, product capabilities and perceived value, relationships with OEMs and distributors, and product availability and service. We believe we compete successfully with our strength in distribution, established brand name, engineering capabilities, and renewed financial flexibility. Our principal competitors include Furuno, Garmin, Navico, Johnson Controls, as well as numerous smaller companies.

Surveillance

Our Surveillance segment focuses on providing enhanced vision and detection capabilities to a wide variety of military, paramilitary, law enforcement, public safety, and other government customers. Our systems typically provide the capability to see over long distances, day or night, through adverse weather conditions, through many obscurants, and from a wide variety of vehicle, man portable, and fixed installation platforms. Currently, the majority of our Surveillance infrared imaging systems use cooled detector technology to identify objects from long distances; however, uncooled thermal imaging systems are growing rapidly in certain markets such as weapon sights, hand-held monoculars/binoculars, military vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Many of our customers require systems that operate in demanding environments such as extreme climatic conditions, battlefield and military environments, or maritime conditions. Systems are often installed onto larger platforms and must be able to integrate with such other systems as aircraft avionics, radars, laser systems, command and control centers, and large, broad-based security networks. 

Surveillance offers a very wide array of products across multiple applications. For airborne applications, we have developed highly stabilized platforms, known as gimbals, which typically contain multiple payloads in addition to the infrared imaging system, as well as sophisticated software and analytic capabilities. For land applications, we manufacture three types of products: hand-held products, platform mounted products, and targeting products. Platform mounted surveillance systems include imaging and radar solutions which are typically housed in a weather-tight enclosure and feature remote control capabilities and multi-sensor integration capability. Hand-held products are ruggedized and have optional lenses and target location capabilities. Ground-based targeting products are designed to attach to existing daylight sights to provide bore-sighted, nighttime capabilities. For maritime applications, we manufacture shipborne products which are similar to our airborne gimbals, but are inverted and customized for the marine environment. 

We address our core markets through either a commercial, off-the-shelf (“COTS”) model or a commercially developed, military qualified (“CDMQ®”) model. The products we develop under the COTS model are applicable to a range of commercial and government customers and markets, including military applications. CDMQ products are specifically designed to meet military specifications. In both the COTS and CDMQ product development models, we use internally generated funds for research and development, and we generally own all rights to the products and their design.

Markets

We enter into contracts and subcontracts which are subject to certain risks related to doing business with the United States government and may be subject to termination, reduction and/or amendment at the election of the United States government. For a discussion of these risks, see sections “We depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business” and “As a United States government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations” in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Surveillance typically has the highest backlog of our segments relative to revenue and in absolute terms. At December 31, 2013, Surveillance backlog totaled $233 million, compared with $261 million at December 31, 2012.

Customers

Surveillance customers generally consist of United States and foreign government agencies, including civilian, military, paramilitary, and police forces, as well as defense contractors and aircraft manufacturers. A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales to United States and foreign government agencies and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales. We expect revenue outside the United States to continue to account for a significant portion of our Surveillance revenue, but demand for our equipment is increasing rapidly outside the United States. The Surveillance segment is susceptible to some seasonality in its orders primarily based on the United States government budget year end. The result is that the third quarter tends to exhibit the largest amount of orders for our Surveillance segment. However, fiscal policy trends, budget delays, and general economic trends can overshadow this seasonality in any given year.

Competition

The Surveillance segment operates in highly competitive markets. Many of our competitors in the government sector are well established contractors for various governments and have more financial and other resources than we possess. The principal competitive factors in the government markets include technical innovation, agency relationships, product quality and reliability, price, and ability to deliver. We believe we compete successfully in these markets with our best-in-class technologies, our products’ abilities to outperform customer requirements and competitors’ products, our lower priced solutions that result from our commercial operating model, and our service and support functions that exist in the field and near the customer. Our current principal competitors in the Surveillance markets include divisions of BAE Systems, DRS (a Finmeccanica company), Elbit Systems, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Sagem, Sofradir, and Thales.

Detection

Our Detection segment is a global supplier of field-ready products that accurately detect, classify and identify CBRNE threats. These products utilize mission-based user interfaces to expedite decision making for both field operators and advanced technicians. With advanced detection technologies that provide lab-quality confidence, the results are field-proven in third party tests and in real life missions. Customers around the world use our products for forensic analysis, military reconnaissance, force protection, public security, law enforcement, emergency response, environmental monitoring, building and event security, teaching and research. 

Detection leverages an established technical research and development organization which enables the business to offer smart, simple and reliable products that meet the evolving needs of government and commercial security providers no matter where the mission may be. We design and manufacture the leading portable explosive detector, the smallest spectroscopic radiation detector and the first desktop trace detector to utilize next generation mass spectrometry technology. With significant experience in managing government-funded research and development projects, Detection has developed relationships with various government decision makers and has substantial knowledge of the governmental procurement process.

Government and private sectors continue to seek new ways to address increasingly sophisticated CBRNE terrorist threats and to respond to other security risks, natural disasters and unintentional incidents that threaten public safety. Our Detection segment designs, develops and manufactures multi-purpose products that meet the requirements for a broad range of end users and end uses. These products have allowed us to build a leadership position in the homeland security and defense market, while also positioning us to address new applications that include environmental monitoring, food safety, and narcotics detection.

Chemical threat detection instruments are used by various military, public and private organizations to quickly and accurately detect trace amounts of chemical warfare agents, illicit and synthetic drugs, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, toxic industrial chemicals and environmental pollutants. We offer both indoor and outdoor biological air monitors that are used by various governmental agencies for security at facilities and events. Our explosives detection products are used to identify military-grade explosives and homemade explosive devices in a wide array of military and public safety applications, such as screening high-risk individuals at checkpoints and identifying improvised explosive device (IED) makers, and our radiation products protect the public by warning of radionuclide exposure. 

Sales and Distribution

Detection sells our products worldwide primarily through a combination of a direct sales force and certain distributors but also utilizes third-party sales representatives, value-added resellers, and systems integrators. With a centralized sales organization and specialized sales teams that serve specific markets, we have been successful at building and leveraging strong relationships with key decision makers at various government agencies and commercial entities. Some Detection products are designed as components or sub-systems that are incorporated into third party products or systems. 

Detection derives a portion of its revenue, approximately 27 percent in 2013, from funding received from agencies of the United States government pursuant to research projects. The revenue recognized under these contracts represents reimbursement by the customer for time periods ranging from several months to several years. Our participation in these and other development programs has culminated in the development of a number of commercial products. In general, our contracts with the United States government permit us to retain all rights to patents emerging from the funded research and development.

At December 31, 2013, Detection had a total backlog of $19 million. Backlog represents orders that have been received for products, contract research and development, or other services for which a contractual agreement is in place and delivery or performance is expected to occur within twelve months.

Customers

Detection sells its products, systems, and services to a broad base of federal, state and local government customers, to all branches of the United States military, foreign militaries, and to private sector businesses and commercial ports both in the United States and internationally. Utilizing a regionally-deployed sales force, the business sells to agencies of the United States government, such as the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, and Energy, as well as the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, NASA, the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and agencies of multiple state and local governments in the United States. Similar to Surveillance, the Detection segment experiences some seasonality in its orders due to the United Stated government budget year end.

Competition

The markets in which Detection competes are dynamic and highly competitive. Success in these markets depends on our ability to develop new technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer needs, reduce production and development costs, integrate with third-party devices and systems, establish and foster relationships with key government and commercial customers, and recruit highly technical personnel. Detection competes in various markets with companies such as Agilent Technologies, Canberra Industries, Idaho Technologies, NUCSAFE, Safran, SAIC, Smiths Detection, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and United Technologies.

Research & Development

Our success has been and will continue to be substantially affected by our ability to innovate new products and technologies that both augment our existing offerings and create new avenues for growth. We strive to differentiate ourselves from our competition with our R&D capabilities. Our internally funded research and development expenses were $147.7 million, $137.4 million and $147.2 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We intend to continue to have significant internal research and development expenses in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative and high quality products to maintain and enhance our competitive position in each of our business segments. In addition to these internally-funded amounts, we have spent a declining amount on research and development projects that were reimbursed by government agencies or prime contractors pursuant to development contracts we undertook. 

Proprietary Rights

Given our focus on being the innovation leader in our key markets, we have numerous pending and issued patents and trademarks, commercial and technical trade secrets and other intellectual property that are important for our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, a strong Internet domain presence, confidentiality agreements, joint development agreements, and robust contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Over the past several years we have intensified our efforts to protect and police our intellectual property from improper use and misappropriation. We will continue to actively develop our intellectual property and intend to emphasize initiatives that will further promote innovation and leadership in marketable technology. We cannot, however, be certain or give any assurance that we can secure patent or trademark protection on all our innovations, maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop similar or superior capabilities.

Manufacturing

We manufacture many of the critical components for our products, including but not limited to infrared detectors, gimbals, pan-tilts, optics and coatings, laser sub-systems and micro-coolers, and develop much of the necessary software and middleware for our systems. This vertical integration minimizes lead times, facilitates prompt delivery of our products, controls costs and ensures that these components satisfy our quality standards. We purchase other parts pre-assembled, including certain detectors, certain coolers and optics, circuit boards, cables and wire harnesses. These purchased and manufactured components are then assembled into finished systems and tested at one of our primary production facilities located in the United States, Sweden, Estonia, and Canada. Certain components and finished goods, especially many of our Raymarine and visual security products, are produced by contract manufacturers.

Our manufacturing operations are, from time to time, audited by certain OEM customers, which include several major aircraft manufacturers, and have been certified as meeting their quality standards. Substantially all of our manufacturing locations are either ISO 9001:2000 or :2008 certified with certain locations having higher certifications.

Customer Service

We maintain service facilities at many locations worldwide. Each of our service facilities has the capability to perform the complex calibrations required to service thermal imaging systems. We also maintain field service capabilities under the direction of our independent representatives or distributors in locations outside the United States.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2013, we had 2,839 employees of which 1,665 were located in the United States and 1,174 were located outside of the United States. We have generally been successful in attracting highly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a union or other bargaining group. Certain employees in Europe are represented by unions and workers councils whose contracts are subject to periodic renegotiations. We believe our relationships with our employees, unions and workers councils are good.

15

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements. We have also assessed the risk for environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and facilities and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification from the sellers of those businesses and facilities.

We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance will all existing applicable environmental laws and permits. Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material.
