 Overview  

 L-3 Holdings, a Delaware corporation organized in April 1997, derives all of its operating income and cash flows from its wholly-owned subsidiary, L-3 Communications. L-3 Communications, a Delaware corporation, was organized in April 1997. L-3 is a prime system contractor in Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C3ISR) systems, government services, and aircraft modernization and maintenance. L-3 is also a leading provider of high technology products, subsystems and systems. Our customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of State (DoS), U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), allied foreign governments, domestic and foreign commercial customers and select other U.S. federal, state and local government agencies.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2009, we generated sales of $15.6 billion, operating income of $1,656 million and net cash from operating activities of $1,407 million. The table below presents a summary of our 2009 sales by major category of end customer. For a more detailed presentation of our sales by end customer, see Major Customers on page 13.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We have the following four reportable segments: (1) C3ISR, (2) Government Services, (3) Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M), and (4) Electronic Systems (previously named Specialized Products). During the 2009 fourth quarter, we renamed our Specialized Products reportable segment Electronic Systems to better describe the nature of the segments businesses. Financial information for our reportable segments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

 Business Strategy  

 Our business strategy is customer-focused and aims to increase shareholder value by providing products and services to our customers that create value for them with responsive, high-quality and affordable solutions. Financially, our emphasis is on sustainably growing earnings per share and cash flow. Our strategy involves a flexible and balanced combination of organic growth, cost reductions, select business acquisitions and divestitures, and dividends and share repurchases, enabling us to grow the Company and also return cash to our shareholders. We intend to maintain and expand our position as a leading prime system contractor and supplier of products,    

 1   
 subsystems, systems and services to the DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, allied foreign governments and commercial customers, both domestic and international. Our strategy includes the elements discussed below.  

 Entrepreneurial, Accountable and Results-Driven Culture. A key part of L-3s strategy is to create an entrepreneurial, accountable, and results-driven culture that is focused on meeting our customers needs and on achieving L-3s strategic goals and growth objectives. L-3s culture is made up of diverse people providing creative solutions and ideas in an environment that fosters teamwork and collaboration across our business units. Operating with integrity and with a commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct is an important part of our strategy to build and maintain the trust of our customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and communities where we live and work.  

 Focus On Outstanding Program Performance. We believe that outstanding performance on our existing programs and contracts in terms of on-budget, on-schedule and in accordance with our contractual obligations is the foundation for successfully meeting our objectives of expanding L-3s prime contractor and supplier positions and growing sales organically. We believe that a prerequisite for growing and winning new business is to retain our existing business by successfully meeting the performance criteria in our existing contracts. We will continue to focus on delivering superior contract performance to our customers in order to maintain our reputation as an agile and responsive contractor and to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.  

 Expand our Prime Contractor and Supplier Positions. We intend to expand our prime system contractor roles in select business areas where we have domain expertise, including C3ISR, aircraft modernization and maintenance and government technical services. We also intend to enter into teaming arrangements with other prime system contractors and platform original equipment manufacturers to compete for select new business opportunities. As an independent supplier of a broad range of products, subsystems and systems in several key business areas, our growth will partially be driven by expanding our share of existing programs and participating in new programs. We also expect to identify opportunities to use our customer relationships and leverage the capabilities of our various businesses, including proprietary technologies, to expand the scope of our products and services to existing and new customers. Furthermore, we intend to continue to supplement our growth by participating in and competing for new programs internationally, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia.  

 Align Research & Development with Customer Priorities. We intend to continue to align our products, services, internal investments in research and development and business development activities to proactively address customer priorities and requirements. We also intend to grow our sales through the introduction of new products and services and continued increased collaboration among our businesses to offer the best quality and competitive solutions and services to our customers.  

 Grow Sales Organically and Selectively Acquire Businesses. We intend to use our existing prime contractor and supplier positions and internal investments to grow our sales organically. We expect to continue to benefit from our positions as a supplier to multiple bidders on select prime contract bids. We plan to maintain our diversified and broad business mix with its limited reliance on any single contract, follow-on or new business opportunities. We also expect to continue to supplement our organic sales growth by selectively acquiring businesses that add new products, services, technologies, programs and contracts, or provide access to select customers and provide attractive returns on investment.  

 Continuously Improve our Cost Structure and Business Processes. We intend to continue to aggressively improve and reduce our direct contract costs and overhead costs, including general and administrative costs. Effective management of labor, material, subcontractor and other direct costs is a primary element of favorable contract performance. We also intend to grow sales at a faster rate than overhead costs. We believe continuous cost improvement will enable us to increase our cost competitiveness, expand our operating margin and selectively invest in new product development, bids and proposals and other business development activities to organically grow sales.  

 Collaborate to Increase Growth Opportunities. We intend to continue to collaborate among our diversified businesses to develop new business opportunities. The combination of our leading technologies and our speed and    

 2   
 agility to meet customer requirements and priorities will allow us to accelerate our shift from a black box provider to a system solutions provider.  

 Selected Recent Business Acquisitions and Business and Product Line Dispositions  

 During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used cash of $90 million for business acquisitions. We did not sell any businesses or dispose of any product lines during 2009. See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Business Acquisitions and Business and Product Line Dispositions on page 38 for additional details about our 2009 business acquisitions, including their aggregate purchase prices.

 Backlog and Orders  

 We define funded backlog as the value of funded orders received from customers, less the cumulative amount of sales recognized on such orders. We define funded orders as the value of contract awards received from the U.S. Government, for which the U.S. Government has appropriated funds, plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the U.S. Government. A table that presents our funded backlog, percent of December 31, 2009 funded backlog expected to be recorded as sales in 2010 and funded orders for each of our reportable segments is located in Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Backlog and Orders on page 62.  

 Major Customers  

 The table below presents a summary of our 2009 sales by end customer and the percent contributed by each to our total 2009 sales. For additional information regarding domestic and foreign sales, see Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Direct sales to the end customer represent approximately 70% of our consolidated sales, and we are a subcontractor or supplier for the remaining 30%. Additionally, approximately 75% of our DoD sales for 2009 were direct to the customer, and approximately 25% were indirect through other prime system contractors and subcontractors of the DoD.  

 Our sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the U.S. Government. Various U.S. Government agencies and contracting entities exercise independent and individual    

 13   
 purchasing decisions, subject to annual appropriations by the U.S. Congress. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our five largest contracts generated 12% of our consolidated sales. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our largest contract (revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales, was the Special Operation Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) contract, which generated approximately 3% of our sales. On March 3, 2009, SOFSA announced that L-3 was not selected to perform on the follow-on contract. L-3 subsequently protested and, as a consequence, SOFSA has taken corrective action, which will include the issuance of a revised solicitation. Once a new solicitation is issued, proposals will be requested from all bidders. We were notified that a new solicitation will be issued in approximately April 2010, with an expected award date of January 2011. We may not succeed in the recompetition for the next SOFSA contract. We anticipate receiving funding on our current contract extending it from February 28, 2010 to the end of 2010, although we have not yet received the contract extension modification.  

 Research and Development  

 We conduct research and development activities that consist of projects involving applied research, new product and systems development and select concept studies. We employ scientific, engineering and other personnel to improve our existing product-lines and systems and develop new products, technologies, and systems. As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 13,000 engineers, a substantial portion of whom hold advanced degrees, and work on company sponsored research and development efforts and customer funded research and development contracts.  

 Company-sponsored (Independent) research and development costs for our businesses that are U.S. Government contractors are allocated to U.S. Government contracts and are charged to cost of sales when the related sales are recognized as revenue. Research and development costs for our commercial businesses are expensed as incurred and are also charged to cost of sales. The table below presents company-sponsored (Independent) research and development expenses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 for our U.S. Government businesses and our commercial businesses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Customer-funded research and development costs pursuant to contracts (revenue arrangements) are not included in the table above because they are direct contract costs and are charged to cost of sales when the corresponding revenue is recognized. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding research and development.  

 Competition  

 Our businesses generally encounter intense competition. We believe that we are a major provider for many of the products and services we offer to our DoD, government and commercial customers.  

 Our ability to compete for existing and new business depends on a variety of factors, including,  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 14   
       our ability to quickly and flexibly meet customer requirements and priorities.    

 In some instances, we are the incumbent supplier or have been the sole provider on a contract for many years, and we refer to these positions as sole-source. On our sole-source contracts, there may be other suppliers who have the capability to compete for the contracts involved, but they can only enter the market if the customer chooses to reopen the particular contract to competition. Sole-source contracts are generally re-competed every three to five years and at times more frequently. For the year ended December 31, 2009, contracts where we held sole-source positions accounted for 51% of our total sales and contracts which we had competitively won accounted for 49% of our total sales.  

 We believe we are the defense supplier with one of the broadest and most diverse portfolios of products and services. We are primarily a non-platform prime system contractor and have diverse subcontractor positions. We supply our products and services to other prime system contractors. However, we also compete directly with other large prime system contractors for (i) certain products, subsystems and systems, where they have vertically integrated businesses and (ii) niche areas where we are a prime system contractor. We also compete with numerous other aerospace, defense and government technical services contractors, which generally provide similar products, subsystems, systems or services. We believe that a majority of our businesses enjoy the number one or number two competitive position in their market niches. We believe that the primary competitive factors for our businesses are technology, research and development capabilities, quality, cost, market position responsiveness and past performance. Some of these competitors are larger than we are and, therefore, have greater financial and other resources than we have.  

 In addition, our ability to compete for select contracts may require us to team with one or more of the other prime system contractors that bid and compete for major platform programs, and our ability to team with them is often dependent upon the outcome of a competition for subcontracts they award.  

 Patents and Licenses  

 Generally, we do not believe that our patents, trademarks and licenses are material to our operations. Furthermore, most of our U.S. Government contracts generally permit us to use patents owned by other U.S. Government contractors. Similar provisions in U.S. Government contracts awarded to other companies make it impossible for us to prevent the use of our patents in most DoD work performed by other companies for the U.S. Government.  

 Raw Materials  

 Generally, our businesses engage in limited manufacturing activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as a diverse base of third party suppliers and subcontractors. Although certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials, we have not experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes.  

 Contracts  

 A significant portion of our sales are derived from sole-source contracts as discussed above. We believe that our customers award sole-source contracts to the most capable supplier in terms of quality, responsiveness, design, engineering and program management competency and cost. However, as discussed above, we are increasingly competing against other prime system contractors for major subsystems and systems business. As a consequence of our competitive position, for the year ended December 31, 2009, we won contract awards at a rate in excess of 53% on new competitive contracts that we bid on, and at a rate in excess of 95% on the number of contracts we rebid for when we were the incumbent supplier.  

 Generally, the sales price arrangements for our contracts are either fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material type. Generally, a fixed-price type contract offers higher profit margin potential than a cost-plus type or    

 15   
 time-and-material type contract, which is commensurate with the greater levels of risk we assume on a fixed-price type contract.  

 On a fixed-price type contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Accounting for the sales on a fixed-price type contract requires the preparation of estimates of (1) the total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work, and (3) the measurement of progress towards completion. Adjustments to original estimates for a contracts revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change.  

 On a cost-plus type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contracts fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship which total allowable costs bear to target cost. Sales from cost-plus type contracts with award fees were approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. Sales from cost-plus type contracts with incentive fees were approximately $751 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our customer satisfaction and performance record is evidenced by our receipt of performance-based award fees achieving 95% of the available award fees on average during the year ended December 31, 2009.  

 On a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.  

 We believe we have a balanced mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts, a diversified business base and an attractive customer profile with limited reliance on any single contract.  

 The table below presents the percentage of our total sales generated from each contract-type for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Substantially all of our cost-plus type contracts and time-and-material type contracts are with U.S. Government customers. Substantially all of our sales to commercial customers are transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements and are included in our fixed-price type contract sales.  

 Regulatory Environment  

 Most of our revenue arrangements with agencies of the U.S. Government, including the DoD, are subject to unique procurement and administrative rules. These rules are based on both laws and regulations, including the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), that: (1) impose various profit and cost controls, (2) regulate the allocations of costs, both direct and indirect, to contracts and (3) provide for the non-reimbursement of unallowable    

 16   
 costs. Unallowable costs include, but are not limited to, lobbying expenses, interest expenses and certain costs related to business acquisitions, including, for example, the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses arising from fair value increases to the historical carrying values of acquired assets. Our contract administration and cost accounting policies and practices are also subject to oversight by government inspectors, technical specialists and auditors. See Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors on page 19 for a discussion of certain additional business risks specific to our government contracts.  

 As is common in the U.S. defense industry, we are subject to business risks, including changes in the U.S. Governments procurement policies (such as greater emphasis on competitive procurement), governmental appropriations, national defense policies or regulations, service modernization plans, and availability of funds. A reduction in expenditures by the U.S. Government for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide, lower margins resulting from increasingly competitive procurement policies, a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us or the incurrence of substantial contract cost overruns could materially adversely affect our business.  

 Certain of our sales are under foreign military sales (FMS) agreements directly between the U.S. Government and allied foreign governments. In such cases, because we serve only as the supplier, we do not have unilateral control over the terms of the agreements. These contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with these laws and regulations. Investigations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including repayments, disallowance of certain costs, or fines and penalties. Certain of our sales are direct commercial sales to allied foreign governments. These sales are subject to U.S. Government approval and licensing under the Arms Export Control Act. Legal restrictions on sales of sensitive U.S. technology also limit the extent to which we can sell our products to allied foreign governments or private parties.  

 All of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.  

 Environmental Matters  

 Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements.  

 We have also assessed the risk of environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification, either from the sellers of those acquired businesses or through pollution liability insurance. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and permits. We believe our current expenditures will allow us to continue to be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws, based upon available internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe that after considering recorded liabilities, there are no environmental loss contingencies that, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.   

 17   
 Certain Acquired Pension Plans  

 In connection with our acquisition of ten business units from Lockheed Martin and the formation of L-3 in 1997, we assumed certain defined benefit pension plan liabilities for present and former employees and retirees of certain of these businesses from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin had previously received a letter from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), indicating that the pension plans of two businesses were under funded using the PBGCs actuarial assumptions (Subject Plans).  

 With respect to the Subject Plans, Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement (Lockheed Martin Commitment) with L-3 and the PBGC dated as of April 30, 1997. The terms and conditions of the Lockheed Martin Commitment include a commitment by Lockheed Martin to the PBGC to, under certain circumstances, assume sponsorship of the Subject Plans or provide another form of financial support for the Subject Plans. The Lockheed Martin Commitment will continue until the Subject Plans are no longer under funded on a PBGC basis for two consecutive years, or immediately if we achieve investment grade credit ratings on all of our outstanding debt.  

 If Lockheed Martin did assume sponsorship of the Subject Plans, it would be primarily liable for the costs associated with funding the Subject Plans or any costs associated with the termination of the Subject Plans. The terms and conditions of the Lockheed Martin Commitment would require us to reimburse Lockheed Martin for these costs. Lockheed Martin has not assumed sponsorship or provided another form of financial support for the Subject Plans.  

 We believe we have performed our obligations under the Lockheed Martin Commitment and have not received any communications from the PBGC concerning actions that the PBGC contemplates taking in respect of the Subject Plans.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2009, we contributed $10 million to the Subject Plans. For subsequent years, our funding requirements will depend upon prevailing interest rates, return on pension plan assets and underlying actuarial assumptions. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $256 million and the aggregate plan assets were $174 million for the Subject Plans. At December 31, 2009, we recorded a liability of $82 million for the under funded status of the Subject Plans.  

 Employees  

 As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 67,000 full-time and part-time employees, 84% of whom were located in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 15% are covered by 119 separate collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The success of our business is primarily dependent upon the knowledge of our employees and on the management, contracting, engineering and technical skills of our employees. In addition, our ability to grow our businesses, obtain additional orders for our products and services and to satisfy contractual obligations under certain of our existing revenue arrangements is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.  

 L-3 Holdings Obligations  

 The only obligations of L-3 Holdings at December 31, 2009 were: (1) its 3% Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES) due 2035, which were issued by L-3 Holdings on July 29, 2005, (2) its guarantee of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of L-3 Communications and (3) its guarantee of other contractual obligations of L-3 Communications and its subsidiaries. L-3 Holdings obligations relating to the CODES have been jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L-3 Communications and certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. In order to generate the funds necessary to repurchase its common stock and pay dividends declared and principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness, if any, L-3 Holdings relies on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries or it must raise funds in public or private equity or debt offerings.
