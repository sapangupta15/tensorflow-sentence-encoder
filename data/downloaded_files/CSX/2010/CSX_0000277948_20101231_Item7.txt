Financial Information 

See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for operating revenue, operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years. 

Company History 

  A leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”) – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. 

  Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors. 

  CSX was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System (“Chessie”) and Seaboard Coast Line Industries (“Seaboard”) into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service. 

Competition 

  The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation. 

  CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

PART I  

Regulatory Environment 

  The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, generally applicable to many businesses in the United States. The railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars and locomotives, and hazardous materials requirements. Additionally, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. 

  Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the Company's subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision, the STB has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices, including some railroad rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. This includes jurisdiction over freight car charges, the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers. 

  In 2008, Congress enacted the Rail Safety Improvement Act (the “RSIA”). The legislation includes a mandate that all Class I freight railroads implement a positive train control system (“PTC”) by December 31, 2015. PTC must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as those over which toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials (“TIH”) are transported. Implementation of a PTC system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work-zone limits, and a train from diverting off-course onto another set of tracks through a switch left in a wrong position. Significant capital costs are anticipated with the implementation of PTC as well as ongoing operating expenses. Currently, CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be at least $1.2 billion for the Company. 

  In December 2009, a proposed bill called the “Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2009” was introduced in the Senate but not advanced. In January 2011, the bill now referred to as the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2011 (“STB Reauthorization Bill”) was reintroduced. The STB Reauthorization Bill, if adopted, could increase government involvement in railroad pricing, service and operations. The proposed legislation also includes provisions that would reduce the ability to price at market levels, and open a carrier’s privately-owned and maintained rail network to competitors where certain conditions are met. 

  If adopted as proposed, this bill could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenue and operations, as well as the ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. Prior to the reintroduction of the STB Reauthorization Bill, the STB had already announced two new hearings; one on February 24, 2011 to review the utility of boxcar, intermodal, automotive and other exemptions, and the other on June 22, 2011 to explore the current state of competition in the railroad industry.  

  For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

  For additional information concerning business conducted by the Company during 2010, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

  The following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company’s earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. 

  Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company’s business. For instance, legislation proposed in the Senate in December 2009, and reintroduced in January 2011 (see Regulatory Environment in Part I for further details), if adopted, could significantly change the federal regulatory framework of the railroad industry. Several of the changes under consideration could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s ability to determine prices for rail services, meet service standards and could force a reduction in capital spending. Statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.

PART I   

Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial results. 

  The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies. For example, the RSIA mandated the installation by December 31, 2015 of Positive Train Control (PTC) on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. The FRA issued its final rule in January 2010 on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs on the Company and the rail industry. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. 

Climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial results. 

  Climate change legislation or regulation has been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued various regulations targeting GHG emissions, including rules and standards governing GHG emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles. 

  Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect CSX and its customers’ business, operations and financial results by, among other things: (1) increasing energy costs generally, making it difficult for the Company’s customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like India and China); (2) increasing the Company’s fuel and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (3) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. 

  CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on CSXT’s operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.

PART I    

General economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. 

  The economic recession adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services. Although traffic improved in 2010, a decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the Company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects.  

CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. 

  Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, and environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. 

  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could result in increased operating costs, reduced operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. 

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. 

  The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water, the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases, and the health and safety of our employees. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART I   

  The Company has been, and may in the future, be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company’s incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. 

The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. 

  The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of the Company’s information technology systems, including computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in a service interruption, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. The performance and reliability of the Company’s technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. 

Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. 

  The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping, or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT’s operating costs. 

  Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. 

Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. 

  Most of CSXT's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. If CSXT is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, however, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Under the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted.

PART I   

The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. 

  The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company’s competitive position. 

Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company’s operations. 

  Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. 

  Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these regulations could continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. 

Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. 

  The Company’s operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company’s rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company’s damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.

The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. 

  The Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. Final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves. 

Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. 

  The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, including storm damage, and claims related to train accidents. The Company may incur significant costs to defend such claims.  

  Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company’s insurance coverage.

CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2010, the breakdown of track miles was as follows:

 Network Geography 

CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below. 

Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region with industrial areas in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for exports outside of the U.S. Roughly three of every four tons of domestic coal and almost half of the export coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity. 

Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries consumer goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal. 

Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of Washington, D.C., and provides access to major eastern ports. 

Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the increasing demand for coal in the Southeast.

Locomotives 

  CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 95% are owned by CSXT. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2010, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  As of December 2010, approximately 500 locomotives or 12% were held in temporary storage. As volume continues to return, these locomotives will be placed back into service after restorative maintenance procedures are performed. Of these, over 200 locomotives can be brought back immediately. 

Equipment 

  In 2010, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 211,000. At any time over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these are: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads).  

Table of Contents   

  The Company’s equipment consists of freight cars, containers and chassis. 

Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel. 

Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions. 

Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. 

Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers. 

Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles. 

Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood. 

Containers - Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight. 

Chassis - Wheeled support framework for a container that allows it to be attached to a tractor. All of the Company’s chassis are leased. 

  Other cars owned or leased on the network include, but are not limited to, center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products. The Company also has other types of equipment such as lift equipment and doublestack railcars, which allow for two containers to be mounted one above the other.

  As of December 31, 2010, approximately 11,000 freight cars or 14% were held in temporary storage. These freight cars can be placed back into service immediately as volume returns. 

 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation 

Since 2007, 31 putative class action suits have been filed in various federal district courts against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads. The class action suits have been consolidated in federal court in the District of Columbia. The court has not yet ruled on whether it is appropriate to certify the case as a class action. 

The lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations to the effect that the defendants’ fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The suits seek unquantified treble damages (three times the amount of actual damages) allegedly sustained by purported class members, attorneys’ fees and other relief.  

All but three of the lawsuits purport to be filed on behalf of a class of shippers that allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services from the defendants through the use of contracts or through other means exempt from rate regulation during defined periods commencing as early as June 2003 and that were assessed fuel surcharges. Three of the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of rail services. The court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the direct purchasers’ claims. The court dismissed all of the indirect purchasers’ causes of action seeking money damages, but did not dismiss their request for injunctive relief. The dismissal was upheld on appeal. Plaintiffs then petitioned the United States Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court denied the petition in December 2010.

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART I   

One additional lawsuit was filed, but not served, by an individual shipper. CSXT entered into a tolling agreement with this shipper whereby the shipper agreed to dismiss the lawsuit against CSXT without prejudice and CSXT agreed to extend the statute of limitations for the claims asserted until the end of 2010. That agreement has been extended to the end of 2011. 

CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices are lawful. Accordingly, CSXT intends to vigorously defend itself against the purported class actions, which it believes are without merit. While CSXT cannot predict the outcome of the private lawsuits, or of any government investigations, charges or additional litigation that may be filed in the future, we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, involving both potential criminal and civil liability. If a material adverse outcome were to occur and be sustained, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Other Legal Proceedings

In addition to the matters described above, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA claims by employees, other personal injury claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of CSX management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce. The Company’s network is positioned to reach more than two-thirds of Americans, who account for about three-quarters of the nation’s consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a broad portfolio of products, ranging from coal and new energy sources, like biodiesel and ethanol, to automobiles, chemicals, and consumer products. 

CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying capital that includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvements and share repurchases. In 2011, the Company plans to invest $2.0 billion to sustain core infrastructure and rolling stock, support various strategic investments and fund Positive Train Control (“PTC”) implementation costs. Key terminal expansions and infrastructure projects are important components of CSX’s investment strategy. Strategic investments through public-private partnerships, including the National Gateway initiative and the Massachusetts and Florida projects will provide enhanced transit times and improved service for customers. 

The National Gateway is a multi-year infrastructure initiative which will increase intermodal capacity on key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest. Total project costs are approximately $850 million, of which the Company expects to contribute approximately $400 million. A key component of this initiative is the Company’s new Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal that is scheduled to become operational in the first half of 2011. This high-capacity terminal will expand service offerings to customers as well as improve market access to east coast ports. Once complete, the new terminal will be the most environmentally friendly, technologically advanced intermodal terminal in existence. 

These long-term investments provide a foundation for volume growth, productivity as well as safe and reliable operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company’s rail service will be reflected in any potential new legislation and policy. 

In addition to investing in its network, CSX increased its quarterly cash dividend twice from 22 cents to 26 cents per share during 2010. These were the seventh and eighth dividend increases over a five-year period and represents a 35 percent compounded annual growth rate. CSX also expects to repurchase approximately $300 million in shares by the end of the first quarter, representing the remainder of its existing $3 billion share repurchase program.

2010 HIGHLIGHTS 

  ·    Revenue increased $1.6 billion or 18% to $10.6 billion primarily driven by increases in volume and core pricing gains.    

  ·    Expenses increased $794 million or 12% to $7.6 billion driven primarily by higher labor-related costs, an increase in volume-related costs and higher fuel prices.    

  ·    Operating income increased $801 million or 35% to $3.1 billion and operating ratio improved to 71.1%, both being all-time annual records.    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2010 results reflect strong year-over-year volume and revenue growth as a result of the improving economy. Revenue increased 18% from the prior year, to nearly $10.6 billion, with gains across all of the Company’s markets with particular growth in automotive and metals. Overall gains were driven by a 10% increase in volume, continued pricing above rail inflation and higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices. The Company achieved pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that rail-based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. 

As volume increased, expenses increased by $794 million, or only 12%, from the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by higher labor-related costs including inflation and incentive compensation, an increase in volume-related costs and higher fuel expense due to a rise in fuel prices. Although expenses increased year-over-year, CSX was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 71.1% due to the Company’s continued focus on cost control and productivity initiatives. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2009. This activity did not have a material impact on the Company’s full year results of operations. 

For additional information, refer to Results of Operations discussed on pages 35 through 39.

PART II  

In addition to the financial highlights described above, the Company measures and reports safety and service performance. Over the last five years, CSX has improved its safety and service measures by more than 50% and generated nearly $1 billion in total productivity gains. In effect, CSX has worked to create a culture of accountability, which focuses on delivering enhanced performance by communicating a focus on leadership, discipline and execution. 

During 2010, the Company again demonstrated great improvements related to safety and operating performance. For 2010, the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) personal injury rate improved 17% to 1.01, compared to 1.20 in 2009. This is a record full-year personal injury performance for the full year at CSX. The 2010 reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 9% to 2.68, compared to 2.94 in 2009. These excellent results were achieved through a sustained commitment to safety. 

Key service metrics in 2010 declined slightly as volume increased 10% from last year. On-time train originations and arrivals declined to 75% and 69%, respectively. Dwell time increased to 25.0 hours from 24.1 hours in 2009. Average train velocity declined 4% to 21.0 miles per hour. While these key measures declined, they remain within the ranges experienced over the last several years and continue to support efficient and reliable train operations for CSX’s customers.

Capital Expenditures 

In addition to producing strong financial, safety and service results, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2010 capital expenditures increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion in 2009. (The 2009 amount includes $160 million of cash payments for new assets purchased in the prior year using seller financing. These payments are reflected in the financing section of the consolidated cash flow statement.) The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity.  

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure) 

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $823 million to $1.5 billion.  

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

      (a) In addition to property additions of $1,427 million and $1,719 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, total capital expenditures included cash payments for purchases of new assets using seller financing of approximately $160 million and $54 million, respectively. There were none in 2010. These payments are shown in financing activities on the consolidated cash flow statement. Property additions are shown in investing activities on the consolidated cash flow statement.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II  

2010 vs. 2009 Results of Operations 

CSX full year results reflect continued strong year-over-year volume and revenue growth as a result of the improving economy. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in most markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2009. 

Volume and Revenue 

Merchandise 

Agricultural 

Agricultural Products – Volume grew with increased shipments of feed grains and ethanol. Shipments of feed grains improved with expanded meat production and lower wheat imports. Ethanol shipments grew as the amount of ethanol in fuel continued to increase. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Volume increased as a result of strength in demand for domestic fertilizers due to a strong planting season and due to replenishment of low inventories. 

Food and Consumer – Volume increased slightly as strength in refrigerated products, primarily fruits and vegetables, and alcoholic beverages were partially offset by weakness in demand for appliances. 

Industrial 

Chemicals – Growth occurred across most markets reflecting improvement in demand for intermediate products used in manufacturing automobiles and consumer goods. Many plastics and chemicals are key inputs in the production of both durable and nondurable goods, as well as packaging. 

Automotive – Strong growth was driven by an increase in North American light-vehicle production in response to increased demand in the improving economy.  

Metals – Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of sheet steel for auto production, increases in scrap steel resulting from higher steel production and increases in energy-related products. 

Housing and Construction 

Emerging Markets – Shipments increased in limestone, transportation equipment and aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) as a result of overall market growth due to the improving economy. 

Forest Products – Volume increased with strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products. Volume also increased slightly in construction-related markets. 

36 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II   

Coal 

Volume was basically flat as increased export shipments were offset by weakness in utility shipments. Higher export shipments were due to greater demand for U.S. metallurgical coal in Asia and steam coal in Europe. Shipments to utility customers were down as high utility stockpiles were reduced throughout the year and are approaching targeted levels. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, higher fuel recovery and longer length of haul. Total coal volume is expected to increase as the Company expects to ship approximately 35 – 40 million tons of export coal and projects increases in utility coal volume in 2011. 

Intermodal 

  International and domestic shipment growth resulted from U.S. inventory replenishment, improved U.S. exports, new business, truckload conversions, and new UMAX and door-to-door service offerings. 

The revenue-per-unit decline was driven by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program at the start of second quarter. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation. This revenue-per-unit decline was partly offset by increased fuel recovery and an improved pricing environment. 

Other 

  Revenue gains were primarily driven by benefits for contract volume commitments not met. 

Expense 

Total expenses for 2010 increased 12% or $794 million to $7.6 billion compared to the prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. 

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $328 million primarily driven by inflation and higher incentive compensation. 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. In addition, this category includes amounts paid to other transportation companies. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $76 million in 2010. This increase was primarily driven by the following: 

37 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II   

  ·    Volume increases drove higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. In addition, maintenance expenses increased as locomotives previously held in storage during 2009 due to lower volume were placed back into service during 2010. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase.    

  ·    As safety and occupational claim trends have continued to improve, changes in estimate were recorded in both years - $49 million in 2010 and $105 million in 2009. This resulted in a year-over-year increase in casualty expense of $56 million.    

  ·    An operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. This property is a former Conrail-acquired property. The Company received $50 million of cash related to this transaction.    

  ·    The above increases to expense were offset by $126 million of reduced purchased transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program during 2010 in the intermodal business.    

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $363 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and higher volume. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.55 or 32% from $1.71 in 2009 to $2.26 in 2010. 

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $44 million in 2010 primarily due to a larger asset base. 

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $17 million primarily due to cost savings associated with improved asset utilization and lower lease expense, partially offset by volume-related increases. 

Other 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased $1 million to $557 million primarily due to lower average debt balances during 2010. 

38 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II  

Other Income – Net 

Other income decreased $2 million to $32 million primarily related to lower interest income caused by lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates in 2010. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense increased $365 million to $983 million primarily due to higher earnings during 2010. 

Net Earnings 

Net earnings increased $420 million to $1.6 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $1.17 to $4.06 in 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2010.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II   

2009 vs. 2008 Results of Operations 

Volume and Revenue 

Revenue decreased $2.2 billion, or 20%, to $9.0 billion from the prior year driven by a 15% decline in volume and lower fuel cost recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices. The broad-based economic recession drove year-over-year volume declines across all major markets. In the 2009 challenging environment, the Company continued to achieve pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that rail-based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. 

Merchandise 

Agricultural 

Agricultural Products – Volume was down slightly as the growth in ethanol and export grain was more than offset by lower poultry production which negatively impacted the feed grain and ingredient markets. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – International and domestic shipments declined due to lower phosphate and potash soil application by farmers in reaction to lower prices for grain and the tight credit environment. 

Food and Consumer –Weakness in residential construction caused reduced shipments of appliances and other consumer goods. Yet, basic needs markets such as food products were less severely impacted by the economic conditions. 

Industrial 

Chemicals – Volume declined as weakness in the housing, automotive and consumer goods markets significantly reduced demand for chemical products related to those markets. Revenue per unit was flat as yield management efforts were offset by lower fuel recovery. 

Automotive – Volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the weak economy and a tight credit environment. However, volume improved in the second half of the year as inventories stabilized and the Cash for Clunkers program helped spur sales. Revenue per unit was negatively impacted by lower fuel recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices. 

Metals – The largest decline in volume was experienced in metals driven by weak global and domestic steel demand in the automotive and construction industries. The decline in demand moderated during the year due to replenishment of low inventories and an improvement in automotive production. 

Housing and Construction 

Emerging Markets – Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in both residential and non-residential construction. 

41 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II   

Forest Products – A weak housing market drove the decline in lumber and building products. Paper volume continued to be soft due to electronic media substitution and less packaging being used as a result of lower consumer spending. 

Coal 

Volume declines were driven by lower demand from electric utilities and a decrease in exports compared to 2008. Domestic coal demand for generating electricity was down due to natural gas substitution and lower industrial production, resulting in continued high stock pile levels.  The 2009 export market decline was a result of both lower steel production in Europe reducing the need for metallurgical coal (used to produce steel) and less expensive alternative global sources for European utilities. Overall revenue per unit for the coal market improved as yield management efforts more than offset lower fuel recovery. 

Intermodal 

Volume decline was driven by a decrease in international traffic due to the economy which was partially offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments, over-the-road truckload conversions, and expanded service offerings. Revenue per unit was lower primarily due to decreased fuel recovery and competitive truck pricing. 

Expense 

Total expenses for 2009 decreased 20% or $1.7 billion to $6.8 billion compared to the prior year. Significant year-over-year changes are described below. 

Labor and Fringe expenses decreased $326 million primarily driven by labor productivity initiatives, such as employee furloughs and reduced crew overtime. Lower incentive compensation was partially offset by inflation and other items. 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses decreased by $408 million in 2009. This decrease is driven by several items: 

  ·    Volume-related expenses decreased as a result of lower operating costs at automotive facilities and terminals. In addition, maintenance expenses decreased as locomotives were placed into storage as a result of reduced shipments during 2009. Lower travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this decrease.    

  ·    As safety and occupational claim trends have continued to improve, changes in estimate were recorded in both years - $105 million in 2009 and $10 million in 2008. This resulted in a year-over-year reduction in casualty expense of $95 million.    

  ·    Prior year storm and proxy-related items not repeated in the current year accounted for approximately $74 million of this decrease.    

  ·    Improved collections and a stabilizing economic environment caused a $25 million decrease in bad debt expense.

  ·    The decreases described above were partially offset by an increase in inflation-related items in 2009.    

Fuel expense decreased $968 million primarily due to sharply lower fuel prices and lower volume. Average fuel prices per gallon decreased $1.37 or 44% from $3.08 in 2008 to $1.71 in 2009. 

Depreciation expense increased $3 million primarily due to a slightly larger asset base. This increase was largely offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies. 

Equipment and Other Rents expense decreased $34 million mainly due to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases. 

Other 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased $39 million to $558 million due to higher average debt balances in 2009. 

Other Income – Net 

Other income decreased $66 million to $34 million in 2009. 2008 results included a $30 million non-cash adjustment to correct equity earnings from a non-consolidated subsidiary that was not repeated in 2009. Reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash and investment balances also contributed to this decrease. In addition, real estate sales declined during 2009. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense decreased $229 million to $618 million primarily due to lower earnings in 2009. 

Net Earnings 

Net earnings decreased $212 million to $1.1 billion and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.43 to $2.89 in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to the following factors: 

  ·    Operating income decreased $481 million primarily due to lower revenue.    

  ·    Offsetting this decrease was a $145 million increase in income from discontinued operations as 2008 included an impairment loss related to The Greenbrier as well as a $229 million decrease in tax expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed. 

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows 

Consolidated Balance Sheets 

CSX’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases. 

Total assets increased $1.3 billion from the previous year. This was driven by net properties which increased $735 million since December 2009 due to planned capital expenditures. Other long-term assets increased $188 million as a result of cash consideration paid in the exchange of debt securities (see Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements). On the liability side, the Company increased net debt by $656 million due to additional borrowings. Deferred income tax liability also increased by $525 million due to the impact of accelerated depreciation and bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation increased from 50% to 100% due to legislative changes that became effective in September 2010 and will continue in 2011. Finally, shareholders’ equity decreased $68 million as a result of $1.5 billion of share repurchases since December 2009 which was offset by increased earnings during 2010. 

Sources of Cash 

The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2010, the Company generated $3.2 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a $1.2 billion increase from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in 2010. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2012. This facility can be increased by an additional $500 million to $1.75 billion with the approval of the lending banks. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not drawn on this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. 

CSX filed its shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2010. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.

PART II   

Uses of Cash 

Net cash used in investing activities during 2010 was driven by $1.8 billion of property additions. Funds used for property additions are further described below. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

      (a) Certain amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective change in accounting policy for rail grinding, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.    

      (b) Cash paid for new assets purchased using seller financing are included in other financing activities on the consolidated cash flow statements.    

Among other things, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders. CSX paid dividends of $372 million in 2010, which was $27 million more than prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share at the beginning of 2010 and then to $0.26 in fourth quarter 2010. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion which increased $920 million primarily as a result of $1.5 billion of share repurchases offset by net debt in 2010. 

Capital spending programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation services. For 2011, CSX plans to spend $2.0 billion of capital of which over half will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. Approximately $260 million (including PTC), or 13%, of 2011 total capital spending will be applied toward the implementation of unfunded required regulatory projects. CSX intends to fund these capital investments through cash generated from operations. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return and growth or productivity investments such as the new intermodal terminal located in Northwest Ohio.

PART II   

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations. Although new legislation or regulations, such as the STB Reauthorization Bill or climate change legislation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K), it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact. However, the Company continues to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of its operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, reducing fuel consumption and increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions. 

Liquidity and Working Capital 

Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with over $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX also has a $1.25 billion credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks that was not drawn on. Additionally, in 2010, the Company issued $800 million of new long-term debt.  

The Company also has a $250 million receivables securitization facility with a 364-day term and expires in December 2011. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances drawn on this facility. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX will service the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. 

Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $318 million and $705 million at December 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decline since December 2009 is primarily due to a $500 million reclassification from long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt for amounts due within the next twelve months. 

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, the Company has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility and shelf registration statement, to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA+ and Aaa1 for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. 

Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. Currently, CSX’s long-term ratings fall at the lower end of this category. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt. 

SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 

The following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other commitments: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $14 million for freight cars and locomotives (see Note 13, Related Party Transactions). This amount plus total operating leases-net of $378 million above equals total net lease commitments of $392 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.    

  (b)    Other commitments of $125 million consisted of surety bonds and letters of credit. Surety bonds are issued by a third-party as an assurance that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement.    

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

 For detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: 

  ·    casualty, environmental and legal reserves;    

  ·    pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;    

  ·   depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and    

  ·   income taxes      

Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves 

Casualty 

Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury claims and asbestos. During 2010 the Company increased its self-insured retention amount for these claims from $25 million to $50 million per injury for claims occurring on or after June 1, 2010. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company’s self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Most of the claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. 

As of December 2010, the Company had $375 million in casualty reserves. See below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves.

Personal Injury 

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act. 

CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT’s historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. 

During 2010 and 2009, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $24 million and $84 million respectively. These reductions were based on management’s review of the actuarial analysis performed by an independent actuarial firm. In recent years, the Company has experienced a continued downward trend in the number of injuries which has resulted in a continued reduction of the CSXT’s Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) personal injury rate. These reductions in reserves are a direct result of the Company’s improvement in safety and were included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements. 

Occupational & Asbestos 

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss. 

The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

CSXT retains a third-party specialist to assist management in assessing the value of the Company’s occupational and asbestos reserves. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management and third-party specialists have determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries. 

The third party specialist analyzes CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX employment records and industry data from the Railroad Retirement 2009 report. From this analysis, the specialist provides an estimate of the IBNR claims liability. 

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims. 

During 2010 and 2009, the Company reduced occupational reserves by $12 million and $19 million respectively. The 2010 reduction is primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of repetitive stress injury claims and lower settlement values for irritant claims. The 2009 reduction is attributable to a decrease in the number of carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injury claims. This reduction was included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements. 

During 2010 and 2009, the Company reduced its reserves for asbestos claims by $13 million and $24 million, respectively. The 2010 reduction was primarily related to some claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence as well as a decrease in the estimate of future claim filings. The 2009 reduction was also primarily related to a significant number of claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence. These reductions in reserves were included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Environmental 

The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. 

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. 

In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as: 

  ·    type of clean-up required;    

  ·    nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);    

  ·    extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and    

  ·    number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.    

As of December 2010, the Company had $107 million in environmental reserves. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Legal 

In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. 

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting 

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2010, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.5 billion. CSX made pension plan contributions of $250 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2009 and none in 2010. 

In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a self-insured post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees will be covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees will continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

For information related to the funded status of the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans. 

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation—Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:  

  ·    discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;    

  ·    long-term rate of return on plan assets;    

  ·    salary scale inflation rates;    

  ·    health care cost trend rates; and    

  ·    other assumptions.    

The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount, long-term rate of return, salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. 

Discount Rates 

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company’s expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans’ expected benefit payments. 

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2010 pension and post-retirement obligations are 5.0% and 4.5%, respectively. For 2009, the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 5.25% and 4.75%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans. As of December 2010, the time horizon for pensions is approximately 11 years, while, for post-retirement, the time horizon is approximately 7 years. 

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 8.25% and 8.5% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Salary Scale Inflation Rates 

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.0% to value its 2010 and 2009 pension obligations. 

Health Care Cost Trend Rates 

Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The 2010 and 2009 assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 8.5% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and 8.0% for Medicare-eligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5% in 2018, based upon current actuarial projections. However, the year-to-year comparisons may fluctuate. 

Other Assumptions 

 The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management.

2011 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense 

Net pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2011 is expected to be approximately $75 million and $26 million, respectively, compared to $54 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2010. The increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2008 and the decrease in the discount rate (which causes expense to increase). 

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2010 estimated pension and post-retirement expense: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method 

The Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 87% of total fixed assets of $32 billion on a gross basis at December 2010. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life. 

The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II  

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets. 

Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. 

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations. 

There are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include: 

  ·    statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;    

  ·    statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;    

  ·    evaluation of current operations;    

  ·    evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;    

  ·    previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;    

  ·    expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and    

  ·    comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the life study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time. 

In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars). 

Recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes, which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $947 million and $903 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in a $9 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. The Company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road, track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of $11 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2009. 

Income Taxes 

CSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2008. The federal income tax return for 2009 currently is under review. During 2010, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2010. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2010, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $20 million.
