Item 1. Business  

General  

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. Our products and services are designed to meet our customers needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce manufacturing business risk.  

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1996 in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RICs shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928.

In March 2006, we sold the assets of our ElectroCraft Engineered Solutions (ElectroCraft) business. Accordingly, we reflect the results of ElectroCraft as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  

In September 2006, we sold our 50 percent interest in Rockwell Scientific Company LLC (RSC). More information regarding the sale of our interest in RSC is contained in Note 2 in the Financial Statements.  

On January 31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. We sold these businesses to Baldor Electric Company (Baldor) for $1.8 billion, comprised of $1.75 billion in cash and approximately 1.6 million shares of Baldor common stock. During 2007, we reported an after-tax gain on the sale of $868.2 million ($5.39 per diluted share). The results of operations and gain on sale of these businesses are reported in income from discontinued operations in the Financial Statements for all periods presented.  

As used herein, the terms we, us, our, the Company or Rockwell Automation include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.

Geographic Information  

In 2008, sales to customers in the United States accounted for 50 percent of our total sales. Our principal markets outside of the United States are in Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, Brazil and Germany. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our operations outside of the United States. Sales and property information by major geographic area for each of the past three years is contained in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.  

Competition  

Depending on the product or service involved, our competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies specializing in niche products and services. Factors that influence our competitive position are our broad product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology leadership, knowledge of customer applications, large installed base, established distribution network, quality of products and services, price and global presence.  

Distribution  

In the United States and Canada, we sell our products primarily through independent distributors that typically do not carry products that compete with Allen-Bradley® products. We sell large systems and service offerings principally through a direct sales force, though opportunities are sometimes identified through distributors. Outside the United States and Canada, we sell products through a combination of direct sales and sales through distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were between 9 and 10 percent of our total sales.

Research and Development  

Our research and development spending for the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $191.3 million, $166.9 million, and $148.5 million, respectively. Customer-sponsored research and development was not significant in 2008, 2007 or 2006.  

Employees  

At September 30, 2008 we had approximately 21,000 employees. Approximately 9,800 were employed in the United States, and, of these employees, about three percent were represented by various local or national unions.  

Raw Materials and Supplies  

We purchase many items of equipment, components and materials used to produce our products from others. The raw materials essential to the conduct of each of our business segments generally are available at competitive prices. Although we have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors, we depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers.  

Backlog  

Our total order backlog at September 30 was (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods due to the short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities. Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond 2009 were approximately $97.2 million as of September 30, 2008.  

Environmental Protection Requirements  

Information about the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks  

We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and operations. Various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been made to us. We believe that none of these claims or requests will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. While in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property.  

The Companys name and its registered trademark Rockwell Automation® is important to each of our business segments. In addition, we own other important trademarks that we use, such as Allen-Bradley®, A-B® and ICS TriplexTM for our control products and systems for industrial automation, and Rockwell Software® and FactoryTalk® for our software products.  

Seasonality  

Our business segments are not subject to significant seasonality. However, the calendarization of our results can vary and may be affected by the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules.
