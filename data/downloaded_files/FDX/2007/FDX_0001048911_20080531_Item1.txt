PART I  

ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

Overview  

FedEx Corporation (FedEx) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four reportable business segments:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In June 2008, we announced our decision to minimize the use of the Kinkos trade name and to change the name of FedEx Kinkos to FedEx Office and the name of the companys locations to FedEx Office and Print Centers. The new name better reflects the wide range of services available at the retail centers and takes full advantage of the powerful FedEx brand. The centers will be rebranded over the next several years.  

For financial information concerning our reportable business segments, refer to the accompanying financial section, which includes managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and our consolidated financial statements.

Our Web site is located at fedex.com. Detailed information about our services and our e-commerce tools and solutions can be found on our Web site. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our Web site, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These and other SEC filings are available through the Investor Relations page of our Web site, the address of which is http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. The information on our Web site, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced.  

Strategy  

FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies. Through our holding company, we provide strategic direction to, and coordination of, the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business solutions.  

We are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the FedEx customer experience. For instance, notwithstanding short-term macro-economic conditions, we continue to expand our transportation networks (as described below) to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience. In addition, we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers, such as through our integration of recent acquisitions in the long-haul LTL freight and international domestic express transportation markets, and our new and improved service offerings. For example, in 2008, we launched FedEx International Economy service in ten Asia-Pacific markets (where we already offered FedEx International Priority service), and we significantly enhanced our FedEx SameDay service offerings with the addition of same-day services for freight shipments and a new intra-city same-day service in select markets.  

We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our recently redesigned Web site, fedex.com, provides a single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment tracking, customer service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup and delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped.  

We manage our business as a portfolio  in the long-term best interest of FedEx as a whole, not a particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively, our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of FedEx as a whole.  

4   
While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise. Each companys operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment.  

Our compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate. For example:  

    To accommodate anticipated international growth at FedEx Express, we are purchasing aircraft and improving services to and from Europe and Asia based on the long-term growth prospects of these regions.  

    We are expanding network capacity at our fast growing FedEx Ground company. For instance, we expect to increase FedEx Grounds daily package pick-up capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012.  

    We are slowing the expansion of FedEx Offices retail network as a result of, among other things, reduced customer demand for the companys copy and print services.    

Despite the current macro-economic slowdown and record high fuel prices, we believe the following four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

5   
These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access  to goods, services and information. This access is fueling a remarkable transformation of the worlds economy, helping businesses and nations flourish, and empowering individuals with greater choices and opportunities. Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward even stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability by:  

    Optimizing and expanding our worldwide FedEx Express network, particularly in key markets such as China, India and Europe.  

    Increasing the capacity, speed and reliability of our FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight networks.  

    Emphasizing the compete collectively part of our core strategy through service improvements and focusing on delivering the best customer experience in the industry, resulting in better alignment across all FedEx networks.    

In sum, our overall long-term goal is to:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Reputation and Responsibility  

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the worlds most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2008:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation, but also in corporate social responsibility and sustainability. FedEx understands that a sustainable business is intrinsically tied to a sustainable society. We are committed to sustainably connecting the world, and enhancing the long-term value of the company for our shareowners and employees, and for the communities and businesses that rely on our services. We expect to publish our first corporate social responsibility (CSR) report later this year. The report will measure and document FedExs response to many global and local issues and opportunities that are relevant to our mission, values and core competencies.  

6   
Our People  

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. In 2008, we were listed among FORTUNEs 100 Best Companies to Work for in America, a list that we have made in ten of the past eleven years. It is our people  our greatest asset  that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 290,000 employees and contractors who are absolutely, positively focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare.  

Our Community  

We are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work, all around the world. As an example, we routinely donate our transportation capabilities and services to deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes, such as in support of the China earthquake and Myanmar (Burma) relief efforts this calendar year. We promote diversity by, among other things, making contributions to non-profit organizations that promote access to education, such as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the United Negro College Fund and the Asian & Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund.  

In addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism, we develop strategic relationships with certain charitable organizations that share our values, including:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The Environment  

We are committed to protecting the environment. FedEx evaluates the environmental impacts of FedEx packaging and copy and print services, and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention and the use of copy paper with a high recycled content.  

FedEx is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean, alternative and renewable energy sources. First in our industry to introduce hybrid vans in our fleet, we now operate more than 170 hybrid vehicles around the globe, with more than two million miles in revenue service. Our hybrid electric vehicles decrease greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 percent and increase fuel economy by over 40 percent compared with conventional vehicles.  

Our solar power generation systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability. In 2008, we installed solar-electric systems at two of FedEx Freights facilities in California. In calendar 2005, we opened Californias then largest corporate solar electric rooftop system atop the FedEx Express regional hub in Oakland. To date, this solar electric system has provided approximately 3.2 gigawatt hours of renewable energy.  

We are also modernizing our aircraft fleet. For example, we are retiring and replacing older Boeing 727s with more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increase our jet fuel efficiency. Also, as noted below, we have selected the fuel-efficient Boeing 777 Freighter (B777F) aircraft to meet future international expansion needs.  

8   
Governance  

FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. Reflecting this commitment, we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance listing standards. We have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements. For example, we use a majority-voting standard in uncontested director elections and have a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote, and the Board is prohibited from changing back to a plurality-voting standard without the approval of our stockholders.  

In addition, we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 one of our highest priorities, and we have leveraged this effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting. Our goal has been not only to comply with the law, but also to build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across FedEx today and in the future.  

Our Board of Directors reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, at least annually in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site at http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. We will post in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required. The information on our Web site, however, does not form part of this Report.  

Business Segments  

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments:  

FedEx Express Segment  

FedEx Express  

Overview  

FedEx Express invented express distribution in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through one integrated global network. FedEx Express offers time-certain delivery within one to three business days, serving markets that generate more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, with a money-back guarantee. FedEx Expresss unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the worlds largest express transportation company. FedEx Express employs approximately 145,000 employees and has approximately 53,500 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office and Print Centers), 677 aircraft and approximately 51,500 vehicles and trailers in its integrated global network.  

9   
Services  

FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Overnight package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to virtually the entire United States population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express also offers express freight services backed by money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the time-definite global freight market.  

International express delivery with a money-back guarantee is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx Express also offers a comprehensive international freight service, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance.  

For information regarding FedEx Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology.  

International Expansion  

FedEx Express is focused on further expanding its international presence, especially in key markets such as China, India and Europe. During 2007, we made several strategic acquisitions in those markets, each of which is expected to provide important contributions to our long-term growth, productivity and profitability.  

    We acquired ANC Holdings Ltd. (now rebranded as FedEx UK), a United Kingdom domestic express transportation company. The acquisition of FedEx UK has allowed us to establish a domestic service in the United Kingdom and better serve the U.K. international market, which we previously served primarily through independent agents.  

    We acquired Prakash Air Freight Pvt. Ltd. (PAFEX), our primary service provider in India. The acquisition of PAFEX extends our operations in the global express industry with a wholly owned company in one of the worlds fastest growing markets.  

    We acquired Tianjin Datian W. Group Co., Ltd.s (DTW Group) fifty percent share of the FedEx-DTW International Priority joint venture and assets relating to DTW Groups domestic network in China. The acquisition converted our joint venture with DTW Group, formed in 1999, into a wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition increases our presence in China in the international market and establishes our presence in the domestic market.    

We began serving China in 1984, and since that time, we have expanded our service to cover more than 200 cities and counties across the country. We now employ more than 6,000 workers in China. In addition to the DTW Group acquisition, we have recently taken several other important actions that increase our presence in China and bolster our leadership in the global air cargo industry. For example:  

    In 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, in 2009. We believe the new hub will better serve our global customers doing business in and with the fast-growing China and Asia-Pacific markets.  

    In 2007, we initiated next-morning domestic delivery service in China, which is available in more than 40 cities and counties throughout the country. The new China domestic service is supported by a money-back guarantee and real-time package status tracking. Our China domestic network relies on a hub-and-spoke system centered at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, located in East Chinas Zhejiang Province.    

10   
In support of our international expansion, we have agreed to purchase 15 B777F aircraft, a new high-capacity, long-range airplane, with deliveries beginning in calendar 2009. We also hold an option to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.  

U.S. Postal Service Agreement  

Under a July 2006 agreement with the U.S. Postal Service that runs through September 2013, FedEx Express provides domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal Service, including for its First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately 5,000 drop boxes at U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery for the U.S. Postal Services international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed (GXG).  

Pricing  

FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, during 2008, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. International rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size, weight, destination and, whenever applicable, whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced.  

FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on the spot price for jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2008 was based on the spot price for jet fuel published for April 2008. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2008  17%; 2007  13%; and 2006  14%. These percentages reflect the base rate increases that are associated with certain fuel surcharge reductions.  

Operations  

FedEx Expresss primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the companys multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility, which we are significantly expanding, is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, and Fort Worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. FedEx Express is building a new regional hub in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is scheduled to begin operations in calendar 2009.  

11   
Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Subic Bay, Philippines, serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Subic Bay and Paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami  the Miami Gateway Hub  serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets. As noted above, in 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, beginning in 2009.  

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the stations service area. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption FedEx Express Segment. In some international areas, independent agents (Global Service Participants) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages.  

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, corporate or industrial parks and outside U.S. Post Offices.  

Fuel Supplies and Costs  

During 2008, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See FedEx Express  Pricing.  

The following table sets forth FedEx Expresss costs for jet fuel and its percentage of total revenues for the last five fiscal years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Approximately 10% of FedEx Expresss requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The remainder of FedEx Expresss requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.  

Competition  

The express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency and capacity of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings. Competitors in these markets include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), DHL, passenger airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery concerns, airfreight forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service.  

12   
FedEx Expresss principal competitors in the international market are DHL, UPS, foreign postal authorities such as Deutsche Post and TNT N.V., freight forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Expresss competitors in the international market are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express.  

Employees  

David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Express employed approximately 94,700 permanent full-time and 50,300 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 16% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Expresss international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 25% of all employees. FedEx Express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent.  

The pilots of FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and are employed under a four-year collective bargaining agreement that took effect in October 2006. Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees.  

FedEx Trade Networks  

FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global cargo distribution. FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express at its major hub facilities. Value-added services include Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks publishes customs duty and tax information for over 100 customs areas worldwide. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 3,700 employees and 100 offices in 80 service locations throughout North America and in Asia. Offices are maintained in major European markets and additional Asian locations through dedicated agents.  

FedEx Ground Segment  

FedEx Ground  

Overview  

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back-guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental United States population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental United States population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Puerto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers, primarily FedEx Express.  

13   
FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. In addition, to meet growing customer demand for its services, FedEx Ground is in the midst of a major network capacity expansion program, which is expected to increase its daily pick-up capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012. The multi-phase plan includes the addition of hubs, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities. Each of the new hubs will feature the latest automated sorting technology.  

In addition to the continuing success of FedEx Grounds business-to-business service, the increasing popularity of FedEx Home Delivery, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences, has driven growth in the companys package volumes and financial results. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated exclusively to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.  

Pricing  

FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, during 2008, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Ground contractor or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter.  

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2008 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April 2008. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.  

Operations  

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of approximately 520 facilities, including 30 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 22,000 owner-operated vehicles and 29,500 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Deliverys operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.  

Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of over 3.3 million packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx Web site, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology.  

14   
FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.  

As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Ground had approximately 46,500 employees and 13,250 independent contractors. Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with its employees and independent contractors is excellent, the company is involved in numerous purported or certified class-action lawsuits and other proceedings that claim that the companys owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors) and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, DHL and the U.S. Postal Service.  

FedEx SmartPost  

FedEx SmartPost (a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery to residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a U.S. Postal Service facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its network of 20 distribution hubs and approximately 2,200 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery Monday through Saturday to all residential addresses in the U.S., including P.O. Boxes and military destinations.  

FedEx Freight Segment  

FedEx Freight Corporation  

FedEx Freight Corporation provides a full range of LTL freight services through its FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight services), FedEx National LTL (long-haul LTL freight services) and FedEx Freight Canada businesses, and is known for its exceptional service, reliability and on-time performance. We added the FedEx National LTL and FedEx Freight Canada businesses through our 2007 acquisition of the LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines and certain affiliates.  

Through a comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually all U.S. ZIP Codes (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. In 2008, FedEx Freight strategically expanded its facility network and reduced freight transit times in nearly 2,400 service lanes throughout the United States. FedEx Freights regional and extended LTL freight services are supported by a no-fee money-back guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia via alliances and purchased transportation.  

15   
FedEx Freight specializes in fast-cycle distribution and provides tailored shipping solutions to help shippers meet tight deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers time-critical needs with reduced transit times, after-hours pickup or delivery, or same-day delivery. FedEx Freights fully integrated Web site and other e-tools, including a bill of lading generator and e-mail delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring customers closer to their own account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice service feature uses the companys innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the Internet, e-mail or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments.  

Since the acquisition of FedEx National LTL, we have significantly improved the companys on-time service reliability by integrating and reengineering its network. FedEx National LTL is now a leader when it comes to reliability in the long-haul LTL freight market segment (three-day and more service lanes). FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL have an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to weekly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel. During the first quarter of 2008, FedEx Freight reduced its standard regional LTL fuel surcharge by 25% and FedEx National LTL reduced its standard LTL fuel surcharge to levels commensurate with FedEx Freight.

Technology  

FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smiths vision that the information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy.  

Our technology strategy is driven by our desire for customer satisfaction. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed and reliability. The focal point of our strategy is our award-winning Web site, together with our customer integrated solutions.  

The fedex.com Web site was launched over ten years ago, and during that time, customers have shipped and tracked billions of packages at fedex.com. The fedex.com Web site, which we recently redesigned, is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and customer-focused features. At fedex.com, our customers ship packages, determine international documentation requirements, track package status, pay invoices and access FedEx Office services. Our FedEx Insight application provides customers with visibility and package status of their inbound and outbound express, ground and freight shipments. Our FedEx Global Trade Manager resource enables customers to more easily navigate the complexities of international commerce by helping them identify the documents they need in order to ship to and from specific countries.

FedEx Billing Online provides customers real-time access to their accounts, invoices and paid shipment details.

We have extended the reach of the fedex.com Web site to be accessible from most wireless devices, making it faster and easier for U.S. and Canadian customers to access real-time package status tracking information, rates and drop-off location data for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments. Our wireless service is available through Web-enabled devices, such as mobile telephones, personal digital assistants and Research In Motion (RIM) devices (such as the BlackBerry). FedEx also uses wireless data collection devices to scan bar codes on shipments. Our data collection device, the FedEx PowerPad, uses Bluetooth wireless technology to give our couriers wireless access to the FedEx network, thereby enhancing and accelerating the package information available to our customers.  

We design our e-commerce tools and solutions to be easily integrated into our customers applications, as well as into third-party software being developed by leading e-procurement, systems integration and enterprise resource planning companies.

Trademarks  

The FedEx trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, FedEx Customer Information Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.  

Regulation  

Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.  

The FAAs regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards, maintenance and corrosion control, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.  

19   
The DOTs authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOTs jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.  

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. In May 2006, the TSA adopted new rules enhancing many of the security requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft, and in May 2007, the TSA issued a revised model all-cargo aircraft security program for implementing the new rules. Together with other all-cargo aircraft operators, we have filed comments with the TSA requesting clarification regarding several provisions in the revised model program. Until the requirements for our security program under the new rules are finalized, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future security requirements (including those of foreign governments, as noted below) for air cargo carriers could impose material costs on us.  

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Expresss wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for charter flights.  

Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.  

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.  

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.  

International. FedEx Expresss international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOTs approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments.  

Our operations within foreign countries, such as FedEx Expresss growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict, and sometimes prohibit, our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market. As an example, China is currently considering postal regulation that would substantially limit, if not exclude, foreign-invested companies such as FedEx from competing in the China domestic document delivery market.  

20   
Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Expresss activities pertaining to satellite communications.  

Environmental. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Expresss aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. FedEx Expresss aircraft are also subject to, and are in compliance with, the regulations governing engine emissions. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Expresss aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Expresss significant markets. Congresss passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Expresss international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.  

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Offices copy machines and photo film developing operations. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.  

Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.
