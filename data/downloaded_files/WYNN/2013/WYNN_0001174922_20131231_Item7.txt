ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview  

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. In the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), we operate and own 72.3% of Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006. On April 21, 2010, we opened Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau resort as Wynn Macau | Encore or as our Macau Operations. In Las Vegas, Nevada, we own and operate Wynn Las Vegas | Encore, which we refer to as our Las Vegas Operations. We are developing Wynn Palace, a full-scale casino resort in the Cotai area of Macau.  

Our Resorts  

The following table sets forth information about our resorts as of February 14, 2014:

During 2013, we made renovations to our spa, VIP gaming area and various other areas on our property. In response to our evaluation of our Macau Operations and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.  

Las Vegas Operations  

Wynn Las Vegas | Encore is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, and occupies approximately 215 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. In addition, we own approximately 18 acres across Sands Avenue, a portion of which is utilized for employee parking and an office building, and approximately 5 acres adjacent to the golf course on which an office building is located.  

Our Las Vegas resort complex features:  

       Approximately 186,000 square feet of casino space, offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, a sky casino, a poker room, and a race and sports book;  

       Two luxury hotel towers with a total of 4,748 spacious guest rooms, suites and villas;

       Two showrooms; and  

       Three nightclubs and a beach club.  

During 2013, we remodeled our villas and two of our restaurants. In response to our evaluation of our Las Vegas Operations and the reactions of our guests, we have and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.  

Future Development  

We are currently constructing Wynn Palace in the Cotai area of Macau, a full-scale integrated resort containing a 1,700-room hotel, performance lake, meeting space, casino, spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets. The total project budget, including construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees, is $4 billion. As of December 31, 2013, we have invested $703.7 million in the project. We continue to remain on schedule for an opening in the first half of 2016.  

On July 29, 2013, Wynn Macau and Palo finalized and executed a GMP contract with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, acting as the general contractor. Under the GMP contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the Wynn Palace project. The general contractor is obligated to substantially complete the project in the first half of 2016 for a guaranteed maximum price of HK$20 billion (approximately $2.57 billion). An early completion bonus for achievement of substantial completion on or before January 25, 2016 will be paid to the general contractor if certain conditions are satisfied under the GMP contract. Both the contract time and guaranteed maximum price are subject to further adjustment under certain specified conditions. The performance of the general contractor is backed by a full completion guarantee given by Leighton Holdings Limited, the parent company of the general contractor, as well as a performance bond for 5% of the guaranteed maximum price.

We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the United States, and worldwide. On November 11, 2013, we announced that our Board had elected to withdraw the previously filed application for a gaming license in Pennsylvania. We have made an application for a gaming license in Massachusetts. The process is competitive and we expect to know the outcome by the end of the first half of 2014. Proceeding with this project will require significant expenditure of Company funds. In addition, we are exploring various international jurisdictions for expansion opportunities.  

Results of Operations  

The table below presents our net revenues (amounts in thousands).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reliance on only two resort complexes (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more geographically diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes, many of our customers are premium gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.  

Operating Measures  

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented. Below are definitions of these key operating statistics discussed:  

       Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.  

       Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box.  

       Turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Wynn Macau Operations VIP program.  

       Rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives.  

       Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.  

       Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied including complimentary rooms.  

       Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.  

       Occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.  

Below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentage at our resorts.  

In our VIP casino in Macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable chips, commonly referred to as rolling chips, from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased  

46  

Table of Contents 

 from the cage. Non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the non-negotiable chips in the VIP casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP casino win percentage. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP casino play using this rolling chip method. We expect our win as a percentage of turnover to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%.  

The measurement base used in the general casino is not the same as what is used in the VIP casino. In our general casino in Macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The cash used to purchase the cash chips at the gaming tables is deposited in the gaming tables drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in our general casino. We do not report an expected range for the win percentage in our general casino as chips purchased at the casino cage are excluded from table games drop and distort our expected win percentage. With increased purchases at the casino cage, we believe the relevant indicator of volumes in the mass market segment should be table games win.  

The measurements in our VIP casino and the general casino are not comparable as the general casino tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table while the measurement method in our VIP casino tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement in the VIP casino is much larger than the base measurement in the general casino. As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the VIP casino when compared to the general casino.  

In Las Vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables. The cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming tables drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in Las Vegas. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage in Las Vegas is 21% to 24%.  

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 are comprised of $4,490.6 million in casino revenues (79.9% of total net revenues) and $1,130.3 million of net non-casino revenues (20.1% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 are comprised of $4,034.8 million in casino revenues (78.3% of total net revenues) and $1,119.5 million of net non-casino revenues (21.7% of total net revenues).  

Casino revenues are primarily comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $4,490.6 million represents a $455.9 million (11.3%) increase from casino revenues of $4,034.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our Macau Operations experienced a $365.4 million (10.6%) increase in casino revenues to $3,807.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year casino revenues of $3,442.5 million due primarily to stronger table game volumes in our general casino and VIP casino. Our Las Vegas Operations experienced a $90.5 million (15.3%) increase in casino revenues to $682.8 million, compared to the prior year casino revenues of $592.3 million due to a significant increase in our table games win percentage (before discounts).

The table below sets forth key gaming statistics related to our Macau and Las Vegas operations.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Customers purchase general casino gaming chips at either the gaming tables or the casino cage. Chips purchased at the casino cage are excluded from table games drop and will increase the expected win percentage. With the increased purchases at the casino cage in our Macau general casino, we believe the relevant indicator of volumes in the general casino should be table games win.  

For the year ended December 31, 2013, room revenues were $492.2 million, an increase of $12.2 million (2.6%) compared to prior year room revenue of $480 million. Room revenue at our Macau Operations decreased $3 million (2.6%) to $114.6 million compared to the prior year period of $117.7 million. During 2013, we renovated approximately 600 guestrooms in the original Wynn Macau tower, contributing to an approximate 4.8% reduction in the number of available room-nights during the year. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations increased $15.3 million (4.2%) to $377.6 million compared to the prior year room revenue of $362.3 million. In Las Vegas, during 2013, we experienced an increase in occupancy and an increase in room rates compared to 2012.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, included food and beverage revenues of $586.7 million, retail revenues of $278.9 million, entertainment revenues of $65.4 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of $74.4 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, included food and beverage revenues of $588.4 million, retail revenues of $261.6 million, entertainment revenues of $81.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of $73.8 million. Food and beverage revenues were relatively flat year-over-year at our Macau Operations and Las Vegas Operations. Retail revenues at our Macau Operations increased $10.5 million (5.9%) due to stronger business in our leased stores. Retail revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased $6.7 million (8.0%) as we completed the reconfiguration to certain stores in our retail area during the first half of 2013. Entertainment revenues decreased $16.4 million (20%) due to a Las Vegas show that ended its run in November 2012.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

For the year ended December 31, 2013, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2.8 billion, room expenses of $133.5 million, food and beverage expenses of $323.6 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $175.3 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $448.8 million and $11.9 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2012, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2.6 billion, room expenses of $126.5 million, food and beverage expenses of $308.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $189.8 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $441.7 million and approximately $18.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to higher gaming taxes commensurate with the increase in casino revenue at our Las Vegas Operations and Macau Operations (where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with the concession agreement). Food and beverage expenses increased over the prior year period primarily due to additional nightclub promotional costs at our Las Vegas Operations. The decrease in entertainment, retail and other expenses was due primarily to a Las Vegas show that ended its run in November 2012. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award that was previously granted to our former chief operating officer and increased development costs partially offset by higher expenses related to the share redemption and litigation with a former shareholder that were incurred during the prior year period. During the years ended 2013 and 2012, we recorded adjustments of $14.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively, to our reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends.  

Pre-opening costs  

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $3.2 million of pre-opening costs as compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We began to incur pre-opening costs during October 2012  

49  

Table of Contents 

 related to the design and planning for Wynn Palace. We expect our pre-opening costs to increase in the future as construction and development of Wynn Palace continues toward the expected completion in the first half of 2016.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $371.1 million compared to $373.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.  

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at our Macau Operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to our Macau Operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $17.1 million compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2013, property charges and other related primarily to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts, a contract termination fee and entertainment development costs. For the year ended December 31, 2012, property charges and other related primarily to a remodel of a Las Vegas restaurant, charges related to the cancellation of a Las Vegas show which ended its run in November 2012, and miscellaneous renovations and abandonments.  

In response to our evaluation of our resorts and the reactions of our guests, we continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $15.7 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This increase is mainly due to higher cash balances during 2013. During 2013 and 2012, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. The majority of our short-term investments were primarily in money market accounts, time deposits and fixed deposits with a maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $299 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $288.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our interest expense increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to the issuance of the Wynn Las Vegas $500 million 4 1/4% Senior Notes in May 2013 and a full period of expense for the $1.94 billion Redemption Note and the Wynn Las Vegas $900 million 5 3/8% first mortgage notes, which were issued in 2012. Capitalized interest increased due to the construction costs of Wynn Palace. Capitalized interest will continue to increase with the ongoing borrowings and construction costs of Wynn Palace.  

We recorded a gain of $14.2 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, resulting from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps during those years. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $40.4 million in loss from extinguishment of debt. On May 22, 2013, Wynn Las Vegas completed the purchase of $274.7 million of the 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) pursuant to a tender offer for any and all of the 2017 Notes. In connection with this tender offer, Wynn Las Vegas paid $19.6 million in consideration to holders who tendered their notes. Additionally, Wynn Las Vegas expensed $6.7 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount related to the 2017 Notes and incurred other fees of approximately $0.3 million related to the tender offer. On November 1, 2013, Wynn Las Vegas redeemed the untendered 2017 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the redemption, we incurred redemption fees of $8.9 million and expensed $4.9 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount.  

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized $25.2 million in loss from extinguishment of debt primarily attributable to the amendment of our credit agreements. In March 2012, Wynn Las Vegas entered into an eighth amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement). In connection with this amendment, Wynn Las Vegas prepaid all term loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement, terminated all of its revolving credit commitments that were due to expire in 2013, and terminated all but $100 million of its revolving credit commitments expiring in 2015. In connection with this transaction, we expensed deferred financing fees of $4.8 million. Additionally, as described in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 Long-Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we amended our Wynn Macau credit facilities in July 2012. In connection with amending the Wynn Macau credit facilities, we expensed $17.7 million of deferred financing costs and third party fees.  

Income Taxes  

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $17.6 million. Our income tax benefit is primarily related to a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of Wynn Macau. Since June 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited to be permanently reinvested. No additional U.S. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently reinvested as we anticipate that U.S. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any U.S. tax provision relating to such repatriation. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences which are considered indefinitely reinvested. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau received a second 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits, thereby exempting the casino gaming profits of Wynn Macau through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $107.3 million and $87.1 million in such taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.  

In April 2012, the Company reached an agreement with the Appellate division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding issues raised during the examination of the 2006 through 2009 U.S. income tax returns. The settlement with the Appellate division did not impact the Companys unrecognized tax benefits. The settlement of the 2006 through 2009 examination issues resulted in a cash tax payment of $1.3 million and the utilization of $3.1 million and $0.9 million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards, respectively.  

During December 2012, the IRS completed an examination of the Companys 2010 U.S. income tax return and had no changes. In May 2013, the Company received notification that the IRS completed its examination of the Companys 2011 U.S. income tax return and had no changes.  

For tax year 2012, the Company is participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (CAP), which accelerates IRS examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the taxpayer files its return. The Company believes the IRS will complete their examination of the 2012 tax year in the next 12 months. In March 2013, the Company received notification that it had been selected for the Compliance  

51  

Table of Contents 

 Maintenance phase of CAP for the 2013 tax year. In the Compliance Maintenance phase, the IRS, at its discretion, may reduce the level of review of the taxpayers tax positions based on the complexity and number of issues, and the taxpayers history of compliance, cooperation and transparency in the CAP. The Company does not expect a change in its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the completion of these examinations.  

In July 2012, the Macau Financial Services Bureau commenced an examination of the 2008 Macau income tax return of Wynn Macau. In November 2012, the Company received the results of the examination. While no additional tax was due, adjustments were made to the Companys foreign net operating loss carryforwards.  

In January 2013, the Macau Financial Services Bureau examined the 2009 and 2010 Macau income tax returns of Palo, which is a co-holder of the land concession for Wynn Palace. The exam resulted in no change to the tax returns.  

In March 2013, the Macau Financial Services Bureau commenced an examination of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Macau income tax returns of Wynn Macau. Since the examination is in its initial stages, the Company is unable to determine if it will conclude within the next 12 months. The Company believes that its liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate with respect to these years.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock through an initial public offering. We recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $275.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $226.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This represents the noncontrolling interests share of net income from Wynn Macau, Limited for each year.  

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 are comprised of $4,034.8 million in casino revenues (78.3% of total net revenues) and $1,119.5 million of net non-casino revenues (21.7% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 are comprised of $4,190.5 million in casino revenues (79.5% of total net revenues) and $1,079.3 million of net non-casino revenues (20.5% of total net revenues).  

Casino revenues are primarily comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 of $4,034.8 million represents a $155.7 million (3.7%) decrease from casino revenues of $4,190.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our Las Vegas Operations experienced a $32.9 million (5.3%) decrease in casino revenues to $592.3 million, compared to the prior year casino revenues of $625.2 million due to a decrease in our table games win percentage (before discounts). Our Macau Operations experienced a $122.8 million (3.4%) decrease in casino revenues to $3,442.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the prior year due to lower turnover and hold percentage in our VIP casino.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Customers purchase general casino gaming chips at either the gaming tables or the casino cage. Chips purchased at the casino cage are excluded from table games drop and will increase the expected win percentage. With the increased purchases at the casino cage in our Macau general casino, we believe the relevant indicator of volumes in the general casino should be table games win.  

For the year ended December 31, 2012, room revenues were $480 million, an increase of $7.9 million (1.7%) compared to prior year room revenue of $472.1 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations increased $8.3 million (2.3%) to $362.3 million compared to the prior year room revenue of $354 million. In Las Vegas, we experienced an increase in room rates during the year ended December 31, 2012, however our occupancy rate decreased 3.2 percentage points, both compared to the prior year. We were able to achieve an increase in ADR as we adjusted rates to attract a higher quality customer who would take advantage of all aspects of our resort. Room revenue at our Macau Operations did not change significantly during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, included food and beverage revenues of $588.4 million, retail revenues of $261.6 million, entertainment revenues of $81.8 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of $73.8 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, included food and beverage revenues of $547.7 million, retail revenues of $260.8 million, entertainment revenues of $82.2 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of $71.8 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased $36.3 million (8%), while our Macau Operations increased $4.4 million (4.8%), as compared to the prior year. The increase in Las Vegas is due primarily to strong business in our beach club and nightclubs. Retail revenues at our Macau Operations increased $2.6 million (1.5%), while retail at our Las Vegas Operations decreased by $1.8 million (2.1%). The increase at Wynn Macau is due primarily to strong same-store sales growth combined with new stores from the first half of 2012. Retail revenues at our Las Vegas Operations decreased as we reconfigured the Encore retail area and rebranded several retail outlets. Entertainment revenues decreased $0.4 million (0.5%) from the prior year primarily due to a Las Vegas show that ended its run in November 2012 and another Las Vegas show that ended in April 2011.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

For the year ended December 31, 2012, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2,626.8 million, room expenses of $126.5 million, food and beverage expenses of $308.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $189.8 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $441.7 million and $18.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2011, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2,686.4 million, room expenses of $125.3 million, food and beverage expenses of $283.9 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $214.4 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $389.1 million and approximately $33.8 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 due to lower volume which caused lower junket commission expense and lower gaming taxes at our Macau Operations (where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with the concession agreement). Although our room revenues increased $7.9 million (1.7%), room expenses increased only $1.2 million (1%) as the revenue increase was driven primarily by increased ADR. Food and beverage expenses increased over the prior year primarily due to additional nightclub promotional costs in Las Vegas. The decrease in entertainment, retail and other expenses was driven by the conversion of certain owned retail stores to leased outlets in Macau resulting in lower cost of sales. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to legal and other costs incurred related to the share redemption and litigation with a former stockholder, higher advertising costs, development and other activities. The provision for doubtful accounts decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 as we recorded an adjustment of $30.9 million that benefitted our reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends.

Pre-opening costs  

We began to incur pre-opening costs during October 2012 related to the design and planning for our Wynn Palace Resort. We expect our pre-opening costs to increase in the future as construction and development of Wynn Palace continues toward the expected completion in the first half of 2016. There were no pre-opening expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2012, was $373.2 million compared to $398 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Depreciation expense decreased due to assets with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of September 2011 at our Macau Operations and assets with a three and six year life becoming fully depreciated throughout 2011 at our Las Vegas Operations.  

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at our Macau Operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to our Macau Operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2012, were $40 million compared to $130.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2012 include the remodel of a Las Vegas restaurant, charges associated with the termination of a Las Vegas show that ended its run in November 2012, charges associated with the reconfiguration of Las Vegas retail areas and miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts.  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2011 include a charge of $109.6 million reflecting the present value of a charitable contribution made by Wynn Macau to the University of Macau Development Foundation. This contribution consists of a $25 million payment made in May 2011, and a commitment for additional donations of $10 million each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive, for a total of $135 million. The amount reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income has been discounted using our then estimated borrowing rate over the time period of the remaining committed payments. Also included are the write off of certain off-site golf memberships by Wynn Las Vegas, miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts, including modifications of the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau retail esplanades, closure of the Blush nightclub and the write off of certain costs related to a show that ended its run in Las Vegas in April 2011.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $12.5 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. This increase in mainly due to higher cash balances during 2012. During 2012 and 2011, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Beginning in April 2011, we have invested in certain corporate bond securities and commercial paper, in addition to holding money-market accounts, U.S. Treasury Bills and bank time deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which has contributed to the increase in interest income.

Table of Contents 

Interest expense was $288.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $229.9 million, net of capitalized interest of $0, for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the issuance of the $1.94 billion Redemption Note by Wynn Resorts, the issuance of the Wynn Las Vegas $900 million 5 3/8% first mortgage notes in March 2012, and the increase in the Wynn Macau term loan offset by the reduction of $370.9 million in Wynn Las Vegas term loan borrowings, all as described in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8Long-Term Debt.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded a gain of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, resulting from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a gain of $14.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Income Taxes  

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a tax expense of $4.3 million. Our income tax expense is primarily related to the timing of the payment of dividends from Macau, stock option exercises and capital expenditures. Since June 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited to be permanently reinvested. No additional U.S. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently reinvested as we anticipate that U.S. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any U.S. tax provision relating to such repatriation. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences which are considered indefinitely reinvested. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau received a second 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits, thereby exempting the casino gaming profits of Wynn Macau through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $87.1 million and $82.7 million in such taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our non-casino profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.  

In April 2012, the Company reached an agreement with the Appellate division of the IRS regarding issues raised during the examination of the 2006 through 2009 U.S. income tax returns. The settlement with the Appellate division did not impact the Companys unrecognized tax benefits. The settlement of the 2006 through 2009 examination issues resulted in a cash tax payment of $1.3 million and the utilization of $3.1 million and $0.9 million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards, respectively.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

We recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $226.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $211.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is attributable to the noncontrolling interests share of net income from Wynn Macau, Limited for each year.  

Adjusted Property EBITDA  

We use adjusted property EBITDA to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, intercompany golf course and water rights leases, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. We use adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance  

56  

Table of Contents 

 of our properties with those of our competitors. We also present adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA. Also, our calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  

The following table (amounts in thousands) summarizes adjusted property EBITDA for our Macau and Las Vegas Operations as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17 Segment Information. That footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property EBITDA to net income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the year ended December 31, 2013, the adjusted property EBITDA at both our Macau and Las Vegas Operations benefitted from stronger operating results primarily in the casino department due to an increase in table games volume and win percentage. Refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Operating Activities  

Our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our Macau and Las Vegas operations (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. Our table games play both in Macau and Las Vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. A significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers that gamble on credit. The ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. Our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. Accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables.  

Net cash provided from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. Cash flow from operations improved due to significant changes in ordinary working capital accounts such as accounts payables and accrued expenses. Also benefitting operating cash flow was increased operating income that was driven primarily by stronger operating results in the casino department.  

57  

Table of Contents 

During the year ended December 31, 2012, our operating activities provided $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease is primarily due to lower casino department profitability and changes in ordinary working capital accounts.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $677.6 million compared to $344.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention of $506.8 million and $241 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2013, capital expenditures included $381.1 million in site preparation costs and piling work for Wynn Palace, along with capital expenditures for various other renovations at our resorts. Capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily related to various renovations at our resorts, a one-time payment of $50 million in consideration of an unrelated third partys relinquishment of certain rights in and to any future development on the Cotai land that we are using for constructing Wynn Palace, as well as site preparation costs for Wynn Palace. 

During the year ended December 31, 2011, our net cash used in investing activities was $459.1 million. Our primary use of cash was for the investment of $215.5 million in corporate debt securities and commercial paper, net of maturities, and $184.1 million in capital expenditures primarily for room and suite remodel at Wynn Las Vegas and various other renovations at our resorts.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $291.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was primarily attributable to payment of dividends of $1,035 million and the redemption of first mortgage notes of $500 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $1,100 million and the increase in our senior term loan facility of $200 million. 

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $382.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was primarily attributable to principal payments of $1,022.8 million on term loan facilities and payment of dividends of $955.5 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1,648.6 million from the issuance of first mortgage notes of $900 million and proceeds of $748.6 million from the fully funded senior term loan facility.  

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we used cash flows in financing activities of $1,057.6 million primarily attributable to payment of dividends. 

Macau Operations  

On October 16, 2013, Wynn Macau, Limited (WML), an indirect subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited, entered into an Indenture, dated as of October 16, 2013 (the WML Indenture), between WML and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, pursuant to which WML issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes). WML received net proceeds of approximately $591.5 million from the offering of the 2021 Notes after deducting commissions and estimated expenses of the offering and will use the net proceeds for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.  

The WML Indenture contains covenants limiting WMLs (and certain of its subsidiaries) ability to, among other things: merge or consolidate with another company; transfer or sell all or substantially all of its properties or assets; and lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets. The terms of the WML Indenture contain customary events of default, including, but not limited to: default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the 2021 Notes; default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the 2021 Notes; failure to comply with any payment obligations relating to the repurchase by WML of the 2021 Notes upon a change of control; failure to comply with certain covenants in the WML Indenture; certain defaults on certain  

58  

Table of Contents 

 other indebtedness; failure to pay judgments against WML or certain subsidiaries that, in the aggregate, exceed $50 million; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all 2021 Notes then outstanding will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.  

During the year ended December 31, 2012, Wynn Macau repaid $150.4 million of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility. On June 27, 2012, the Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility matured with an outstanding balance of $0.  

On July 31, 2012, Wynn Macau amended and restated its credit facilities, dated September 14, 2004 (as so amended and restated, the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities), and appointed Bank of China Limited, Macau Branch as intercreditor agent, facilities agent and security agent. The Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities took effect on July 31, 2012 and expand availability under Wynn Macaus senior secured bank facility to $2.3 billion equivalent, consisting of a $750 million equivalent fully funded senior secured term loan facility and a $1.55 billion equivalent senior secured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, which consist of both Hong Kong Dollar and United States Dollar tranches, were used to refinance Wynn Macaus existing indebtedness, and will be used to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of Wynn Palace, and for general corporate purposes.  

On July 30, 2013, Wynn Macau exercised its option to increase the senior term loan facility by $200 million equivalent pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. The $200 million equivalent was fully funded as of July 31, 2013 and is required to be used for the payment of certain Wynn Palace related construction and development costs.  

The term loan facility matures in July 2018, and the revolving credit facility matures in July 2017. The principal amount of the term loan is required to be repaid in two equal installments in July 2017 and July 2018. The senior secured facilities will bear interest for the first six months after closing at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% and thereafter will be subject to LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of between 1.75% to 2.50% based on Wynn Macaus leverage ratio.  

Borrowings under the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities are guaranteed by Palo Real Estate Company Limited (Palo), a subsidiary of Wynn Macau, and by certain subsidiaries of the Company that own equity interests in Wynn Macau, and are secured by substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, the equity interests in Wynn Macau and substantially all of the assets of Palo.  

In connection with amending the Wynn Macau credit facilities, we expensed $17.7 million and capitalized $33.2 million of financing costs in the year ended December 31, 2012.  

The Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that the Company must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If the Wynn Macau subsidiary has a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal or less than 4.0 to 1, then no excess cash flow prepayment is required. Based on current estimates the Company does not believe that the Wynn Macau Consolidated Leverage Ratio during the year ending December 31, 2014 will exceed 4.0 to 1. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2014.  

The Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, Wynn Macau was required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not greater than 4.0 to 1 as of December 31, 2013, and  

59  

Table of Contents 

 an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, of not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that Wynn Macau was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2013.  

Las Vegas Operations  

On May 15, 2013, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC commenced the tender offer for any and all of the outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited (together with Wynn Las Vegas, the Issuers), and a solicitation of consents to certain proposed amendments to the indenture (the 2017 Indenture) governing the 2017 Notes.  

The tender offer expired on May 21, 2013 and at the time of expiration, Wynn Las Vegas had received valid tenders with respect to approximately $274.7 million of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes outstanding. On May 22, 2013, note holders who validly tendered their 2017 Notes received the total consideration of $1,071.5 for each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes, the premium portion of which totaled approximately $19.6 million. In accordance with accounting standards, the tender offer premium was expensed and is included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, upon the tender offer completion, the Issuers entered into a supplemental indenture, which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default from the 2017 Indenture.  

Also in connection with this transaction, unamortized financing costs and original issue discount related to the 2017 Notes totaling $6.7 million were expensed and are included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  

On November 1, 2013, the Company redeemed the untendered 2017 Notes principal amount of $225.3 million. The redemption price was equal to 103.938% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on November 1, 2013. The total redemption fees paid were $8.9 million and we expensed $4.9 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount.  

Separately, on May 22, 2013, the Issuers completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) pursuant to an indenture, dated as of May 22, 2013 (the 2023 Indenture), among the Issuers, all of the Issuers subsidiaries, other than Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. which was a co-issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2023 Notes were issued at par. The Issuers used the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes to cover the cost of purchasing the 2017 Notes tendered in the tender offer. In addition, the Issuers satisfied and discharged the 2017 Indenture and, in November 2013, used the remaining net proceeds to redeem any and all of the 2017 Notes not previously tendered. In connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, the Company capitalized approximately $4.1 million of financing costs.  

The 2023 Notes will mature on May 30, 2023 and bear interest at the rate of 5 1/4% per annum. The Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the 2023 Notes at any time, which redemption price includes a make-whole premium if redeemed before February 28, 2023. The 2023 Notes are also subject to mandatory redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations of gaming authorities in Nevada.  

The 2023 Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuers and the Issuers restricted subsidiaries ability to: create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and merge or consolidate with another company. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions.  

The 2023 Notes are the Issuers senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuers outstanding 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2020 (7 7/8% 2020 Notes), 7 3/4% First Mortgage Notes due 2020 (the 7 3/4% 2020 Notes) and 5 3/8% First Mortgage Notes Due 2022 (the 2022 Notes and, together with the 7 7/8% 2020 Notes and 7 3/4% Notes, the Existing Notes). The 2023 Notes are secured by a first priority pledge of the Companys equity interests, the effectiveness of which is subject to the prior approval of the Nevada gaming authorities. The equity interests of the Company also secure the Existing Notes. If Wynn Resorts, Limited receives an investment grade rating from one or more ratings agencies, the first priority pledge securing the 2023 Notes will be released.

Table of Contents 

On March 12, 2012, the Issuers issued, in a private offering, $900 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2012 (the 2022 Indenture). A portion of the proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas term loan facilities. In October 2012, the Issuers commenced an offer to exchange all of the 2022 Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The exchange offer closed on November 6, 2012.  

The 2022 Notes will mature on March 15, 2022 and bear interest at the rate of 5 3/8% per annum. The Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the 2022 Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2017, at a premium decreasing ratably to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to March 15, 2015, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes with the net proceeds of one or more qualified equity contributions made to the Issuers by their parent, Wynn Resorts, Limited. The 2022 Notes are also subject to mandatory redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations of gaming authorities in Nevada.  

The 2022 Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuers and the Issuers restricted subsidiaries ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; issue stock of, or members interests in, subsidiaries; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; engage in other businesses; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets; issue disqualified stock; create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions.  

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into an eighth amendment (Amendment No. 8) to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement). Amendment No. 8 amended the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the issuance of the 2022 Notes. With the issuance of the 2022 Notes, Wynn Las Vegas prepaid all term loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement, terminated all of its revolving credit commitments that were due to expire in 2013, and terminated all but $100 million of its revolving credit commitments expiring in 2015. In connection with this transaction, Wynn Las Vegas expensed deferred financing costs of $4.8 million.  

On September 17, 2012, Wynn Las Vegas terminated the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement. No loans were outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement at the time of termination. Prior to such termination, certain letters of credit in which lenders had participated pursuant to the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement were reallocated to a separate, unsecured letter of credit facility provided by Deutsche Bank, A.G. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination.  

In connection with the termination, the Company expensed $2.6 million of previously deferred financing costs and third party fees related to the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement.  

For more information on our outstanding first mortgage notes, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 Long-Term Debt.  

Capital Resources  

At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $2,435 million of cash and cash equivalents and $254.4 million of available-for-sale investments in foreign and domestic debt securities with maturities of up to 2 years. Our cash is available for operations, debt service and retirement, development activities, general corporate purposes and enhancements to our resorts. In addition, we had $199.9 million of restricted cash for Wynn Palace related construction and development costs. Of these amounts, Wynn Macau, Limited and its subsidiaries held $1,822.3 million and $4.9 million in cash and available-for-sale investments, respectively, of which we own 72.3%. If our portion of this cash was repatriated to the U.S. on December 31, 2013, approximately two-thirds of this amount would be subject to U.S. tax in the year of repatriation. Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a

Table of Contents 

 guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, held $381.6 million (including cash of its subsidiaries other than those of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau) and $249.5 million of cash and available-for-sale investments, respectively. Wynn Las Vegas LLC held cash balances of $231.2 million.  

On July 30, 2013, Wynn Macau exercised its option to increase the senior term loan facility by $200 million equivalent pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. The $200 million equivalent was fully funded as of July 31, 2013 and is required to be used for the payment of certain Wynn Palace related construction and development costs.  

We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our Wynn Macau credit facility and our existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2014. If any additional financing becomes necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.  

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank and fixed deposits, investments in money market funds, domestic and foreign bank time deposits and commercial paper, all with maturities of less than 90 days.  

Redemption Price Promissory Note  

Based on the Board of Directors finding of unsuitability, on February 18, 2012, we redeemed and cancelled Aruze USA, Inc.s 24,549,222 shares of Wynn Resorts common stock. Following a finding of unsuitability, our articles of incorporation authorize redemption at fair value of the shares held by unsuitable persons. We engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the fair value calculation and concluded that a discount to the then current trading price was appropriate because of, among other things, restrictions on most of the shares which are subject to the terms of an existing stockholder agreement. Pursuant to our articles of incorporation, we issued the Redemption Price Promissory Note (the Redemption Note) to Aruze USA, Inc., a former stockholder and related party, in redemption of the shares. The Redemption Note has a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion, matures on February 18, 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the Redemption Note. We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the Redemption Note. In no instance shall any payment obligation under the Redemption Note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of Wynn Resorts or as specifically mandated by law. The indebtedness evidenced by the Redemption Note is and shall be subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Redemption Note, to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of Wynn Resorts and of its affiliates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature. Aruze USA, Inc., Universal Entertainment Corporation and Kazuo Okada have challenged the redemption of Aruze USA, Inc.s shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. The outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1ARisk Factors, Item 3Legal Proceedings and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies.  

Wynn Resorts, Limited  

During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we paid cash dividends totaling $7.00 per share, $9.50 per share and $6.50 per share, respectively.  

Our Board of Directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2013, we had purchased a cumulative total of 12,978,085 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program, with no purchases made under this program during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.

Table of Contents 

During 2013 and 2012, the Company repurchased a total of 114,355 (8,796 shares were purchased during the fourth quarter 2013) and 7,640 shares, respectively, in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2013, we had unsecured outstanding letters of credit totaling $16.7 million.  

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2013 (amounts in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2013. Such rates continue at historical lows as of December 31, 2013. Actual rates will vary.  

 [2] Other includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 Income Taxes, of this report, we had $89.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2013.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas debt instruments significantly restrict our ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing its notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indentures. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. While the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain similar restrictions, Wynn Macau is currently in compliance with all requirements, namely satisfaction of its leverage ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

Table of Contents 

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from cash on hand and operating cash flow. We cannot assure you however, that our Las Vegas Operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that our Macau Operations will fund Wynn Macaus debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the Amended Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. Certain legal matters may also impact our liquidity. As described in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16Commitments and Contingencies, Elaine Wynn has submitted a cross claim against Steve Wynn and Kazuo Okada. The Indentures for Wynn Las Vegas provide that if Stephen A. Wynn, together with certain related parties, in the aggregate beneficially owns a lesser percentage of the outstanding common stock of the Company than are beneficially owned by any other person, a change of control will have occurred. If Elaine Wynn prevails in her cross claim, Stephen A. Wynn would not beneficially own or control Elaine Wynns shares and a change in control may result under the Wynn Las Vegas debt documents.  

In the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. The amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability. Any repurchases might be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or by any combination of those methods, in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.  

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.  

The Companys articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the Board of Directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the Companys or any affiliates application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of Wynn Resorts capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by the Company. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.  

On February 18, 2012, the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts determined that Aruze USA, Inc., Universal Entertainment Corporation and Mr. Kazuo Okada are unsuitable under our articles of incorporation and redeemed and cancelled all of Aruze USA, Inc.s, 24,549,222 shares of Wynn Resorts common stock. Pursuant to our articles of incorporation, we issued the Redemption Note to Aruze USA, Inc. in redemption of the shares. For additional information on the redemption and the Redemption Note, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16Commitments and Contingencies.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A summary of our significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our  

64  

Table of Contents 

 accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.  

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates  

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.  

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our resorts, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets. The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.  

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contracts entered into in August 2004 and May 2012 are being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminate in August 2029 and May 2037. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the land concession which currently expires in August 2029, or the gaming concession which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income.  

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  

Redemption Price Promissory Note  

In connection with the redemption of the shares previously held by Aruze USA, Inc., we recorded the fair value of the Redemption Note of approximately $1.94 billion in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. We utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. In determining this fair value, we estimated the Redemption Notes present value using discounted cash flows with a probability weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with risk of the Redemption Note.  

65  

Table of Contents 

Considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the Redemption Note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of pending litigation with the Aruze USA, Inc. (at the time a stockholder of Wynn Resorts), Universal Entertainment Corporation (Aruze USA, Inc.s parent company), and Kazuo Okada (the majority shareholder of Universal Entertainment Corporation and former director of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates) (collectively, the Okada Parties) (see Note 16Commitments and Contingencies); the outcome of on-going investigations of Aruze USA, Inc. by the United States Attorneys Office, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Nevada Gaming Control Board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions. In addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the Redemption Note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty. Accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the Redemption Note could be less than the contractual life of the Redemption Note. 

In determination of the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the Redemption Notes subordinated position relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated our traded debt were considered. Observable inputs for the risk free rate based on Federal Reserve rates for U.S. Treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used. As a result of this analysis, we concluded the Redemption Notes stated rate of 2% approximated a market rate.  

Investments and Fair Value  

We have made investments in domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We determine the appropriate classification (held-to-maturity/available-for-sale) of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Adjustments are made for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. Such amortization is included in interest income together with realized gains and losses and the stated interest on such securities.  

We measure certain of our financial assets and liabilities, such as cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and interest rate swaps, at fair value on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. These accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

We obtain pricing information in determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities from independent pricing vendors. Based on our inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use. The assumptions and inputs used by the pricing vendors are derived from market observable sources including: reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark curves, bids, offers and other market-related data. We have not made adjustments to such prices. Each quarter, we validate the fair value pricing methodology to determine the fair value consistent with applicable accounting guidance and to confirm that the securities are classified properly in the fair value hierarchy. We also compare the pricing received from our vendors to independent sources for the same or similar securities.  

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our Las Vegas Operations. While offered, the issuance of credit at our Macau Operations is less significant when compared to Las Vegas.  

66  

Table of Contents 

 Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.  

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.  

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately 86% and 84% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries.  

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customers financial condition, collection history and any other known information.  

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. In June 2013, the Company recorded an adjustment to its reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends. For the year ended December 31, 2013, this adjustment benefitted operating income by $14.9 million and net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited by $12 million (or $0.12 per share on a fully diluted basis). For the year ended December 31, 2012, this adjustment benefitted operating income by $30.9 million and net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited by $23.3 million (or $0.22 per share on a fully diluted basis). Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately 24.8% and 30.8%, respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.  

At December 31, 2013, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.5 million.  

67  

Table of Contents 

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a regions economy or legal system.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. As of December 31, 2013, changes in our interest rate swap fair values are being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.  

We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. We categorize our interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 in the hierarchy as described above. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

Accounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments we issue. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.  

The expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. We estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. For example, a 10% change in the volatility assumption for the 77,800 options granted in 2013 would have resulted in an approximate $0.01 million change in fair value. Expected term represents the estimated average time between the options grant date and its exercise date. A 10% change in the expected term assumption for the 77,800 options granted in 2013 would have resulted in an approximate $0.3 million change in fair value. These assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.  

Accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.  

As of December 31, 2013, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2,615 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2,543 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. The U.S. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of net foreign source income. Due to our current operating history of U.S. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the utilization of the foreign tax credits. As we become more profitable, each year we reevaluate our methodology in determining the need for valuation allowances. The estimated future foreign tax credit realization was based upon the estimated future taxable income from the reversal of net U.S. taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. The amount of the valuation allowance is subject to change based upon the actual reversal of temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences.  

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  

Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in accounting for income taxes (i.e., likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).  

Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that amends the presentation requirements of an unrecognized tax benefit when a loss or other carryforward exists. The update would require the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions. The effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this statement on its consolidated financial statements.  

69  

Table of Contents 

In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that amends the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amendment would require an entity to present amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes. This update is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company has adopted this update; Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  

In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that is intended to simplify the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value (impairment) of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The update allows for the consideration of qualitative factors in determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests. The effective date for this update is for the years and interim impairment tests performed for years beginning after September 15, 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
