QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS  

The following summary of our long-term debt obligations includes:  

     scheduled principal repayments for the next five years and after,  

     weighted average interest rates for debt maturing in each of the next five years and after and  

     estimated fair values of outstanding obligations.  

We estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt. Changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.

OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES  

We occasionally use derivatives to:  

     achieve the mix of variable-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that we want in our capital structure,  

     hedge commitments in commodities that we produce or buy and  

     manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  

The fair value of our derivatives may vary due to the volatility of the underlying forward prices or index rates associated with them.  

COMMODITY FUTURES, SWAPS AND COLLARS  

As of December 31, 2009, we had no material commodity swap contracts outstanding.
