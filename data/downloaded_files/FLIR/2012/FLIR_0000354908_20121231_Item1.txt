Infrared Technology Overview

Infrared is a portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum that is adjacent to the visible spectrum, but is invisible to the human eye due to its longer wavelengths. Unlike visible light, infrared radiation (or heat) is emitted directly by all objects above absolute zero in temperature. Thermal imaging systems detect this infrared radiation and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then processed into a video signal and displayed on a video screen. Thermal imaging systems are different than other types of “low light” vision systems, such as visible light intensification used in green or gray sighted night vision goggles. Infrared imaging systems are not adversely affected by the presence of visible light, so they can be used day or night, and they are not susceptible to rapid changes in visible light levels. Since infrared systems are detecting emitted infrared radiation, they are passive and thus more covert than certain “active” or “illuminated” systems. Additionally, thermal imaging systems can measure very small temperature differences, a critical feature for a variety of commercial, industrial, and scientific applications.

An infrared detector, which collects or absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electronic signal, is the primary component of thermal imaging systems. The two types of infrared detectors we manufacture and use in our systems are often referred to as “cooled” and “uncooled.” Cooled detectors utilize a mechanical micro-cooler to reduce the operating temperature of the infrared sensor to -200° C, and offer high sensitivity and resolution for long-range applications or those applications requiring high measurement precision. These detectors, while more sensitive and thus able to see farther, result in a product that is more expensive, heavier, more complex, and uses more power than those using uncooled detectors. Uncooled detectors operate at room temperature and thus do not require a micro-cooler, resulting in products that are lighter, use less power and are less expensive to produce than cooled detectors. While the performance of uncooled detectors is improving, uncooled detectors are still less sensitive than cooled detectors. The cost of both types of detectors is declining and we expect to continue reducing costs as volumes rise and the technology advances in the future. We currently expect demand for both types of detectors, or sensors, to increase. 

Recent Acquisitions

Since the beginning of 2008, we have made a total of thirteen acquisitions. During 2012, we made two acquisitions, both within the TVM segment of our Commercial Systems division: Lorex Technology Inc. (“Lorex”) and Traficon International NV (“Traficon”). 

The acquisition of Lorex, which was completed on December 20, 2012, provides us with leading residential and commercial wired, wireless, and IP video surveillance cameras and related technologies. Lorex has two primary product lines. The first product line uses the Lorex brand and is focused on bundled video surveillance systems for homes and small businesses. These systems are available in thousands of retail locations across North America and are typically sold in pre-packaged bundles that include several cameras, a video recorder and various accessories. The second product line, currently marketed under the Digimerge brand, is focused on surveillance systems for professional integrators and installers of advanced security systems to industrial and 

2

commercial customers. The Digimerge brand is intended to be transitioned to the FLIR brand in 2013. Both product lines will expand TVM's existing security systems product line and provide new channels for our infrared technology as we continue to lower the total cost of ownership of thermal technology. 

Traficon is a global leader in video image processing software and hardware for roadway traffic analysis, particularly incident detection and intersection management. Traficon was acquired on December 28, 2012, and provides us with distribution channels and technological proficiencies that we expect will help us accelerate the adoption of thermal technology in the expanding worldwide market for video-based traffic monitoring solutions. Additionally, we expect to integrate Traficon's video analytics capabilities into our other imaging lines of business to offer enhanced functionality and the development of new applications. 

We are selective and opportunistic in our acquisitions, seeking to purchase companies that are strategically significant and additive or complementary to our existing technologies, distribution network, or product portfolio. We are continuously evaluating opportunities for additional acquisitions, but cannot predict the timing, size, or nature of any future activity.

Our ability to continue penetrating and expanding on our leading market position and into the markets for advanced sensor systems is predicated on our success at reducing our internal costs to manufacture systems. Through our commercial operating model, we have had great success designing and manufacturing products that benefit from economies of scale and thus reduce our cost to deliver a product to our customers. We expect to further leverage this model and accelerate the virtuous cycle our business has created where increased unit volume output reduces our costs, allowing us to lower selling prices, which increases demand and sales volume for our products. We intend to continue to reduce costs, through continuing to vertically integrate our operations, expanding our use of shared services, rationalizing our strategic sourcing alternatives, and consolidating and diversifying our manufacturing operations, which we believe will result in increased market demand for our products.

For example, in 2012, we transitioned a European manufacturing operation to the United States, centralized certain shared services functions and manufacturing oversight in Europe, and consolidated several manufacturing facilities in the United States.

Expand Global Reach 

 Expanding and strengthening our already substantial distribution network is vital to our ability to keep pace with demand and the growing adoption of advanced infrared and threat detection systems. Investing in our direct sales force and building relationships with independent distributors and partners is a key priority. Building a presence in new international markets has been successful, most recently in regions of the Middle East, and we intend to continue the development of our global reach. Developing countries such as India and China are areas of focus, as they are emerging economies for our technologies. Additionally, as our sensor technologies become more affordable and prevalent in consumer markets, we have worked to strengthen our marketing and sales channels to better communicate with and serve the millions of potential customers that transact over the Internet, through catalogs, and at retail locations.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our TVM products worldwide through a direct sales staff and a network of distributors and representatives. Our TVM business continues to expand distribution by hiring additional direct sales personnel and expanding third-party distribution networks in specific markets, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and other emerging markets. In certain markets, TVM has chosen to supply camera cores on an OEM basis to companies with well established distribution networks. For example, we are partnered with Autoliv Electronics to most efficiently distribute our core technology into the automotive market. With our further expansion into the low cost segment of the commercial markets, we have developed greater competencies in market research, electronic marketing, marketing communications, and business development. Our ability to identify new markets, adapt our product solutions to meet unique market needs, quickly develop marketing communications that highlight our unique features, and leverage existing and new distribution channels to develop incremental business are important aspects of our marketing and communications efforts.

TVM carries backlog in certain markets, but the business is less backlog dependent than our Government Systems division’s segments. TVM order backlog, defined as orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months, was $158 million as of December 31, 2012, compared with $136 million at the end of 2011. 

Customers

Typical TVM customers include OEMs, major integrators of security systems, security dealers, utility companies, electrical contractors, maritime dealers, law enforcement agencies, outdoor enthusiasts, building inspectors, damage restoration contractors, universities, numerous commercial enterprises, and increasingly, consumers. The emerging personal vision systems market is becoming increasingly accessible as we leverage our business model to reduce the price of advanced thermal imaging products. This consumer market is a key strategic area of focus given the vast size of the customer base and the opportunities it provides us to expand our volumes and brand name. Given the high-value nature of many of our thermography-related instruments, our thermography products’ revenues tend to be correlated with seasonal trends, in particular capital spending trends. In general, customers in markets like predictive maintenance and R&D are sensitive to the broad economy because our cameras are viewed as capital expense items. The sales of our high volume cameras and emerging thermal vision products are somewhat less sensitive to economic cycles due to their lower price points and the growing market awareness of thermal technology. 

Our established distribution network, broad product portfolio, and product and technical development capabilities set a foundation for future success as we continue to leverage our operating model to increase our product volumes and reduce our costs in creating advanced imaging products. As we continue to make our products accessible to a larger population of end-users and build awareness of the advantages of thermal imaging applications, we anticipate our TVM segment will provide significant revenue and profitability for our business.

Competition

Many of the markets that TVM addresses are emerging from the early-adopter environments to broader-based demand, which has attracted competitors. While our market share in thermography products is significant, estimated to be approximately 60 percent based on independent industry research, we view the TVM market as highly competitive, with both large and niche providers of thermal camera equipment. We believe the key drivers of success in these markets are: technological proficiency in imaging sensors, product design and functionality, product quality, product cost, ability to deliver in a timely manner, trustworthy customer service, distribution reach, brand name, and scalability of operations. We are uniquely positioned to operate in this competitive environment given our demonstrated ability to innovate high-quality sensors at low cost due to our operating model, our advanced research and development capabilities, our established and reliable distribution and service network, our diversified manufacturing operations, and our broad product offering. Our competitors vary market by market, but include divisions of Danaher (Fluke), General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Sofradir, Axis Communications, NEC, Testo, and numerous smaller companies. 

Raymarine

Raymarine is a leading provider of marine electronics, and continues as a pioneer in the innovation of technologies that give boaters confidence on the water. The comprehensive suite of products that Raymarine develops and markets is intended to fulfill all of the marine electronic needs of recreational boaters and offer best-in-class integrated control solutions for all of their on-board instrumentation. The current product portfolio includes multifunction displays, autopilots, thermal imaging cameras, radars, sonar modules, and other instruments which interconnect through Raymarine’s proprietary networking solutions. This broad product range is differentiated by the reliability, usability, and interconnectivity of the instruments we provide. Raymarine’s core capability, providing a comprehensive and centralized control, navigation, and communication system that can be managed with a single integrated data output, is valuable to our customers, who increasingly look for quality, technologically advanced products from a single-source.

Our key strategies for Raymarine include continued investment in R&D to create truly new and innovative products and leveraging our global thermal imaging capabilities into the recreational marine industry, expanding into adjacent markets, and enhancing the integration capabilities of the business through investments in software and networking solutions. While the boating market that Raymarine serves is sizable, the industry has been in a cyclical trough. We believe that recent product developments and operational improvements have positioned the business to benefit significantly as global demand returns to historical levels.

Markets

Recreational Boating OEMsA main focus of Raymarine has been to establish relationships with boat manufacturers in order to sell a fully integrated electronic “backbone” on new boats, with the intention of driving brand continuity with a large installed base of end-users. Medium sized (26 to 45 feet in length) and large boats (in excess of 45 feet in length) have a unique need for sophisticated electronics and multifunction control solutions. Additionally, in recent years, demand has grown for scaled-down instruments in the much larger segment for small boats (comprising inflatable and rigid motor craft under 25 feet in length). Raymarine’s comprehensive product offering has evolved to serve these evolving boat manufacturers’ needs well.

AftermarketDue to the comparatively long life of a recreational boat, the growing importance and usefulness of marine electronic equipment and the pace of technological development, the aftermarket is large for electronics systems refits and upgrades. Raymarine has ensured that both our instruments and our networking software are capable of integrating with third party platforms and instruments, which has become a key driver of demand in the aftermarket.

Sales and Distribution

Raymarine’s products are sold through a combination of direct sales, third-party distributors, service partners, and retail outlets. Raymarine has strong relationships with a large number of key boat builder OEMs, most of which are supplied directly with the latest Raymarine systems. Many of these relationships are long-term in nature and have evolved over a number of years with important exchanges of product development ideas. Raymarine’s OEM customers have typically built up important embedded technical product fitting and integration knowledge over a period of time. We have also established confidence in the critical electronic systems fitted to the products we supply to our customers. 

Raymarine also supplies a global network of retailers, distributors and wholesalers. Many of these partnerships are on an exclusive basis, whereby Raymarine is the only electronic boating equipment stocked. Raymarine also has a global network of dealers and service centers which are able to sell, repair, and install Raymarine’s products. This global support and repair service network is very important to boaters as many of our products are critical to the operation of a boat and easy access to parts and service help ensure quick repairs. Additionally, the business has established a presence at retail locations and boat shows, which serves to build the Raymarine brand in both the new-build and aftermarket spaces. Having a strong consumer brand name and a large installed base of users created through our first fitments drives business in the aftermarket as boaters look to upgrade or replace instrumentation, often with the brand with which they are familiar.

Raymarine’s backlog as of December 31, 2012, was $6 million. Raymarine is not considered a backlog intensive business, as shipment of product typically occurs within a few weeks of receipt of orders.

Customers

Raymarine sells its products via diverse distribution channels to a wide variety of customers. Raymarine has established long-term relationships with approximately 250 OEM boat builders, each of which have experience and knowledge of the product capabilities, quality, and reliability. These OEMs value the breadth of the Raymarine product line and our global dealership service network. We supply many OEMs directly, who outfit their new boats with integrated Raymarine electronic systems. As a result of Raymarine’s long standing relationships with OEMs and its ability to provide fully integrated electronic systems, including an electronic “backbone” to a boat, there is a high level of business from consumers purchasing replacement or upgrade equipment for their outfitted boats. We also sell discrete instruments to consumers who are looking to install new or upgrade existing marine electronics on their small, medium, or large boats.

Competition

The maritime electronics markets are intensely competitive with many established brands and companies. We compete with these companies through innovation, product capabilities and perceived value, relationships with OEMs and distributors, and product availability and service. We believe we compete successfully with our strength in distribution, established brand name, engineering capabilities, and renewed financial flexibility. Our principal competitors in the recreational boating market include Furuno, Garmin, Navico, as well as numerous smaller companies.

Surveillance

Surveillance focuses on providing enhanced vision and detection capabilities to a wide variety of military, paramilitary, law enforcement, public safety, and other government customers. Our systems typically provide the capability to see over long distances, day or night, through adverse weather conditions, and from a wide variety of vehicle, man portable, and fixed installation platforms. Currently, the majority of our Surveillance infrared imaging systems use cooled technology to identify objects from long distances; however, uncooled thermal imaging systems are growing rapidly in certain markets such as weapon sights, hand-held monoculars/binoculars, military vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Many of our customers require systems that operate in demanding environments such as extreme climatic conditions, battlefield and military environments, or maritime conditions. Systems are often installed onto larger platforms and must be able to integrate with such other systems as aircraft avionics, radars, laser systems, command and control centers, and large, broad-based security networks. 

Surveillance offers a very wide array of products across multiple applications. For airborne applications, we have developed highly stabilized platforms, known as gimbals, which typically contain multiple payloads in addition to the infrared imaging system, as well as sophisticated software and analytic capabilities. For land applications, we manufacture three types of products: hand-held products, platform mounted products, and targeting products. Platform mounted surveillance systems include imaging and radar solutions which are typically housed in a weather-tight enclosure and feature remote control capabilities and multi-sensor integration capability. Hand-held products are ruggedized and have optional lenses and target location capabilities. Ground-based targeting products are designed to attach to existing daylight sights to provide bore-sighted, nighttime capabilities. For maritime applications, we manufacture shipborne products which are similar to our airborne gimbals, but are inverted and customized for the marine environment. 

We address our core markets through either a commercial, off-the-shelf (“COTS”) model or a commercially developed, military qualified (“CDMQTM”) model. The products we develop under the COTS model are applicable to a range of commercial and government customers and markets, including military applications. CDMQ products are specifically designed to meet military specifications. In both the COTS and CDMQ product development models, we use internally generated funds for research and development, and we generally own all rights to the products and their design.

Markets

Search and RescueThermal imaging systems are used in airborne and shipborne search and rescue missions to rescue individuals in danger or distress on boats or vehicles, or wounded or lost in adverse conditions. Such systems are in use today by organizations such as the United States Army, United States Coast Guard, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Air National Guard, and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense.

Force ProtectionIn instances where military or other personnel are deployed in hostile areas, thermal imaging systems mounted on towers or other platforms are deployed to identify and defeat potential threats at an early stage. Our systems are deployed for this purpose by the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and others worldwide.

Border and Maritime PatrolOur systems are used in airborne, shipborne, hand-held and fixed installation applications for border and maritime surveillance, particularly at night, to enforce borders and coastal waters, to monitor national fishing boundaries and to prevent smuggling. Our cameras are currently deployed along numerous borders worldwide, including in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.

Sales and Distribution

Our Surveillance business has a direct sales staff and a network of independent representatives and distributors covering major government markets worldwide. Included in this total are technical and customer support staff in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific who provide application development, technical training and operational assistance to direct and indirect sales personnel as well as to customers.

We enter into contracts and subcontracts which are subject to certain risks related to doing business with the United States government and may be subject to termination, reduction and/or amendment at the election of the United States government. For a discussion of these risks, see sections “We depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business” and “As a United States government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations” in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Surveillance typically has the highest backlog of our segments relative to revenue and in absolute terms. At December 31, 2012, Surveillance backlog totaled $261 million, compared with $247 million at December 31, 2011.

Customers

Surveillance customers generally consist of United States and foreign government agencies, including civilian, military, paramilitary, and police forces, as well as defense contractors and aircraft manufacturers. A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales to United States and foreign government agencies and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales. Aggregate sales to United States government agencies accounted for 27 percent of our consolidated revenue in 2012, 29 percent in 2011, and 34 percent in 2010. We expect revenue outside the United States to continue to account for a significant portion of our Surveillance revenue, but demand for our equipment is increasing rapidly outside the United States. The Surveillance segment is susceptible to some seasonality in its orders primarily based on the United States government budget year end. The result is that the third quarter tends to exhibit the largest amount of orders for our Surveillance segment. However, fiscal policy trends, budget delays, and general economic trends can overshadow this seasonality in any given year.

Competition

The Surveillance segment operates in highly competitive markets. Many of our competitors in the government sector are well established contractors for various governments and have more financial and other resources than we possess. The principal competitive factors in the government markets include technical innovation, agency relationships, product quality and reliability, price, and ability to deliver. We believe we compete successfully in these markets with our best-in-class technologies, our products’ abilities to outperform customer requirements and competitors’ products, our lower priced solutions that result from our commercial operating model, and our service and support functions that exist in the field and near the customer. Our current principal competitors in the Surveillance markets include divisions of BAE Systems, DRS (a Finmeccanica company), Elbit Systems, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Sagem, Sofradir, and Thales.

Detection

Our Detection segment provides leading capabilities in the development of advanced sensor technologies used to detect and identify CBRNE threats. The Detection segment is focused on developing technologies and products to penetrate a global market for advanced threat detection capabilities.

Sales and Distribution

Detection sells its products worldwide primarily through a direct sales force, but also utilizes third-party sales representatives, value-added resellers, and systems integrators. With a centralized sales organization and specialized sales teams that serve specific markets, Detection has been successful at building and leveraging strong relationships with key decision makers at various government agencies and commercial entities. As some Detection products are designed as components or sub-systems, the business utilizes value-added resellers or systems integrators, including our Integrated Systems segment, for incorporation into their products or systems. For example, Detection provides bio-samplers for first responders, explosives detectors for airport security personnel, and multi-channel analyzers for radiation portals.

Detection derives a portion of its revenue, approximately 27 percent in 2012, from funding received from agencies of the United States government pursuant to research projects. The revenue that we recognize under these contracts represents reimbursement by the customer for time periods ranging from several months to several years. Our participation in these and other development programs has culminated in the development of a number of commercial products. In general, our contracts with the United States government permit us to retain all rights to patents emerging from the funded research and development.

At December 31, 2012, Detection had a total backlog of $24 million. Backlog represents orders that have been received for products, contract research and development, or other services for which a contractual agreement is in place and delivery or performance is expected to occur within twelve months.

Customers

Detection sells its products, systems, and services to a broad base of federal, state and local government customers, to all branches of the United States military, foreign militaries, and to private sector businesses and commercial ports both in the United States and internationally. Utilizing a regionally-deployed sales force, the business sells to agencies of the United States government, such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, NASA, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Coast Guard, as well as agencies of multiple state and local governments in the United States, such as the New York Police Department. Similar to Surveillance, the Detection segment experiences some seasonality in its orders due to the United Stated government budget year end.

Competition

The markets in which Detection competes are dynamic and highly competitive. Success in these markets depends on our ability to develop new technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer needs, reduce production and development costs, integrate with third-party devices and systems, establish and foster relationships with key government and commercial customers, and recruit highly technical personnel.

Research & Development

Our success has been and will continue to be substantially affected by our ability to innovate new products and technologies that both augment our existing offerings and create new avenues for growth. We strive to differentiate ourselves from our competition with our R&D capabilities. Our internally funded research and development expenses were $137.8 million, $147.2 million and $116.6 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We intend to continue to have significant internal research and development expenses in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative and high quality products to maintain and enhance our competitive position in each of our business segments. In addition to these internally-funded amounts, we have spent a declining amount on research and development projects that were reimbursed by government agencies or prime contractors pursuant to development contracts we undertook. 

Focusing on projects that have the highest probability for commercial marketability, our R&D teams are located within our business segments. These teams work to develop products that will fulfill our customers’ constantly evolving needs while also sharing findings, technologies, tools, and best practices with one another. One method that our Government Systems division R&D teams use to ensure our new products evolve with our customers is a development process that utilizes rapid field testing and refinement of new technologies in order to get end-users the critical protection and information tools they need as quickly as possible. A key tenet of our development philosophy is seeking and receiving end-user feedback on new or upgraded products. Engineers in the field work with the end-users in real-time in order to revise and tune products quickly and efficiently. The solicitation and effectiveness of the end-user feedback has proven integral to our success in creating the most technologically advanced yet user-friendly solutions.

Proprietary Rights

Given our focus on being the innovation leader in our key markets, we have numerous pending and issued patents and trademarks, commercial and technical trade secrets and other intellectual property that are important for our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, a strong Internet domain presence, confidentiality agreements, joint development agreements, and robust contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Given our diligent efforts to respect the intellectual property rights of others combined with the important competitive advantages that our intellectual property provides, we have intensified our efforts to police and protect our intellectual property from improper use and misappropriation. We will continue to actively protect our intellectual property and intend to emphasize initiatives that will further promote innovation and leadership in marketable technology. We cannot, however, be certain or give any assurance that we can secure patent or trademark protection on all our innovations, maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop similar or superior capabilities.

Manufacturing

We manufacture many of the critical components for our products, including but not limited to infrared detectors, gimbals, pan-tilts, optics and coatings, laser sub-systems and micro-coolers, and develop much of the necessary software and middleware for our systems. This vertical integration minimizes lead times, facilitates prompt delivery of our products, controls costs and ensures that these components satisfy our quality standards. We purchase other parts pre-assembled, including certain detectors, certain coolers and optics, circuit boards, cables and wire harnesses. These purchased and manufactured components are then assembled into finished systems and tested at one of our primary production facilities located in the U.S., Sweden, Estonia, France, and Canada. Certain components and finished goods, especially many of our Raymarine products, are produced by contract manufacturers.

Our manufacturing operations are, from time to time, audited by certain OEM customers, which include several major aircraft manufacturers, and have been certified as meeting their quality standards. Substantially all of our manufacturing locations are either ISO 9001:2000 or :2008 certified with certain locations having higher certifications.

We have generally been successful in attracting highly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a union or other bargaining group. Certain employees in Europe are represented by unions and workers councils whose contracts are subject to periodic renegotiations. We believe our relationships with our employees, unions and workers councils are good.

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements. We have also assessed the risk for environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and facilities and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification from the sellers of those businesses and facilities.

We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance will all existing applicable environmental laws and permits. Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material.
