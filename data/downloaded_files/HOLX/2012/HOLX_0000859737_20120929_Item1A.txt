Item 1A. Risk Factors  

This report contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect us. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. The cautionary statements made under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report are intended to be applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they may appear in this report. We urge you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.  

Risks Relating to our Business  

The continuing worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding world financial markets and continuing weak worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of actual or potential debt default by certain European countries, have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Additionally, constrictions in world credit markets have caused and may continue to cause our customers to experience increased difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products. Economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums and co-payments may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists, which in turn would adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. If the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.  

Sales and market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payors. The failure of third-party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.  

Sales and market acceptance of our medical products and the treatments facilitated by our products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our products and treatments has and will continue to depend upon our customers ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from third-party payors for, these products and treatments. In the U.S., CMS establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Under current CMS policies, varying reimbursement levels have been established for our products and treatments. Coverage policies for Medicare patients may vary by regional Medicare carriers in the absence of a national coverage determination and reimbursement rates for treatments may vary based on the geographic price index. Coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payor decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by CMS. The use of our products and treatments outside the United States is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and private insurance carriers.  

Significant reductions in reimbursement rates proposed or implemented for the use of any our products have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the sales of those products. On an annual basis, CMS publishes reimbursement rates for laboratory services, physician, hospital and ambulatory surgical center payments. CMS published final 2013 rates on November 1, 2012 The CMS reimbursement rates for 2013 included a general reduction of 27% in the SGR factor. This factor is used by CMS in a formula to determine doctor reimbursements and, if implemented, would correspondingly affect the reimbursement for the use of our products. This reduction will go into effect in January 1, 2013 unless legislation is passed by Congress.  

Currently, there is not an established CPT code, reimbursement rate or official coverage for the use of 3D mammography (breast tomosynthesis) as it was only approved by the FDA in February 2011 in connection with our PMA application for our  

20

 Dimensions system. We are working with governmental authorities, professional societies, healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in efforts to secure reimbursement for the use of 3D mammography. However, we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, adequate reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis would adversely affect sales of our Dimensions 3D systems.  

The adoption of healthcare reform in the United States and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of these reforms could harm our business and prospects.  

The healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. The effect of the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010, on our business is uncertain. Among other things, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices beginning January 1, 2013. We expect that this excise tax will apply to the majority, if not all, of our products sold in the U.S. U.S. net product sales represent, and will likely continue to represent a substantial majority of our net revenues. Our U.S. product sales represented 73% and 76% of our net product sales for the years ended September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. The law also includes new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, as well as stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufactures and physicians and hospitals. We expect compliance with the new healthcare legislation, including with these new reporting requirements and the new excise tax, to impose significant additional administrative and financial burdens on us. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The healthcare reform legislation and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the excise tax will increase our costs of doing business. The impact of this healthcare reform legislation and these proposals could harm our business and prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could:  

       limit the use of our products and treatments;  

       reduce reimbursement available for such use;  

       further tax the sale or use of our products;  

       adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted; and  

       further increase the administrative and financial burden of compliance.  

These reforms, cost containment measures and new taxes, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, result of operations, financial condition and prospects.  

Changes in laws affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  

We operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:  

       new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services;  

       changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and treatments and result in lost market opportunity;  

       changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products and treatments to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or treatments, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; and  

       new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.  

We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may cause increased compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.  

Guidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.  

Professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. Recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by healthcare providers and insurers could result in decreased use of our products. For example, in November 2012, the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, known as the ACOG, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released by ACOG in November 2009 and guidelines released in March 2012 by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, known as the USPSTF, and the American Cancer Society.

Our long-term success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and treatments and enhance our existing products and treatments.  

We are devoting significant resources to our continuing research and development programs which are designed to develop new products and treatments and to enhance and improve our existing products and treatments. The successful development of our products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       unanticipated delays in development, clinical trials or the approval or clearance process by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority;  

       access to capital;  

       budget overruns;  

       third-party intellectual property;  

       technical problems; and  

       other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval applications for products or 510(k) clearance.  

Given the uncertainties inherent with product development, introduction, and enhancement our efforts may not be completed on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget, if at all, could harm our business and prospects.  

If we cannot maintain our current corporate collaborations and enter into new corporate collaborations, our product development could be delayed. In particular, any failure by us to maintain our blood screening collaboration with Novartis could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Gen-Probe has relied, to a significant extent, on corporate collaborators for funding the development of and marketing for certain of its products. In addition, we expect to rely on our corporate collaborators for the commercialization of certain products. If any of our corporate collaborators were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner, the development or commercialization and subsequent marketing of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources our corporate collaborators devote to our programs or potential products.  

The continuation of any of these collaboration agreements depends upon their periodic renewal by us and our collaborators. For example, in January 2009 Gen-Probe extended the term of its blood screening collaboration with Novartis to June 30, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances specified in the collaboration agreement. The collaboration was previously scheduled to expire by its terms in 2013.  

If any of our current collaboration agreements are terminated, or if we are unable to renew those collaborations on acceptable terms, we may be required to devote additional internal resources to product development or marketing or to terminate some development programs or seek alternative corporate collaborations. We may not be able to negotiate additional corporate collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and these collaborations may not be successful. In addition, in the event of a dispute under our current or any future collaboration agreements, such as our agreements with Novartis, court or arbitrator may not rule in our favor and our rights or obligations under an agreement subject to a dispute may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse effect on our business or operating results.  

If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory and quality requirements, our ability to sell our products will be harmed.  

The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities. These difficulties have primarily related to delays and difficulties associated with ramping up production of newly introduced products and may result in increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. In addition, production of these newer products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise, which we may be unable to develop. Our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.  

22  

Table of Contents 

In determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we and our distributors require, which could harm our business and results of operations.  

Blood screening and clinical diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA as well as other foreign medical regulatory bodies. In some cases, such as in the United States and the EU, certain products may also require individual lot release testing. Maintaining compliance with multiple regulators, and multiple centers within the FDA, adds complexity and cost to our manufacturing processes. In addition, our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, and these facilities are subject to FDA requirements relating to the Quality System Regulation. We or our contractors may fail to satisfy these regulatory requirements in the future, and any failure to do so may prevent us from selling our products.  

Our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet applicable specifications.  

We are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. Our existing and newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet applicable specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity, mandatory or voluntary recalls or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products may be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which could harm our business and prospects.  

The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of medical products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall could harm the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects. In the past, Gen-Probe voluntarily recalled products, which, in each case, required it to identify a problem and correct it. In May 2011, Gen-Probe voluntarily recalled certain Elucigene test kits for the detection of genetic mutations associated with cystic fibrosis because of issues Gen-Probe identified during quality control stability testing. All affected customers and appropriate regulatory authorities were advised of the voluntary recall and Gen-Probe made a substitute product available. The affected product is CE marked, but is not cleared by the FDA and is not available for sale in the United States. In addition, in May 2011 Gen-Probe initiated a second voluntary recall of certain Elucigene branded tests in Canada upon determination that such products were not properly registered with Health Canada. In April 2012, Gen-Probe voluntarily recalled certain lots of LIFECODES PAK (platelet antibody) products after determining that the negative controls in the assays were increasing signals over time, leading to the potential for decreased product performance.  

Our products may be subject to a future government-mandated recall or further voluntary recalls, and any such recalls could divert managerial and financial resources, be more difficult and costly to correct, result in the suspension of sales of certain of our products and/or harm our reputation and financial results.  

Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.  

We and our contract manufacturers manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Our manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could harm our business and prospects. Because some of our manufacturing operations are located outside the United States, including in Germany, Canada, Costa Rica, the United Kingdom and China, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described below.  

Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products and treatments or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products and treatments are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.

Medical devices cannot be marketed in the United States without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties.  

Medical devices sold in the United States must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.  

Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability. In August 2010, the FDA issued two reports outlining potential changes to the 510(k) regulatory process. In addition, in January 2011, the FDA issued an implementation plan containing 25 specific actions to be implemented in 2011 relating to the 510(k) regulatory process and associated administrative matters. The FDA also deferred action on several other initiatives, including the creation of a new class of devices that would be subject to heightened review processes, until the Institute of Medicine released a related report on the 510(k) regulatory process in July 2011. The FDA is reviewing the Institute of Medicines report as well as public input to determine what, if any, recommendations the FDA will adopt with respect to the 510(k) regulatory process. Many of the actions proposed by the FDA could result in significant changes to the 510(k) regulatory process, which would likely complicate the process of obtaining clearance for products by the FDA. In September 2012, the European Commission proposed new regulations for medical devices. The proposed new regulations cover in one regulation devices that are currently the subject of two separate directives, the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive and the Medical Devices Directive. The adoption of these regulations may impact our international operations through a broadened scope of medical device oversight and/or regulatory reach. Compliance with the new European Commission regulations, if and when adopted, may impose additional administrative and financial burdens on us.  

The markets for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected.  

The successful commercialization of our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;  

       trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;  

       the perceptions of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;  

       recommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers;  

       the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;  

       competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and  

       other technological developments.  

Often, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not established until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment.  

If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments our business and prospects could be harmed.  

The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system may not develop as expected.  

The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products may not continue to develop as expected. There is a significant installed base of conventional digital and screen-film mammography products in hospitals and radiological practices. The use of our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x-ray imaging equipment. As our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis systems are generally more  

24  

Table of Contents 

 expensive than conventional mammography products, we believe that a major factor in the markets acceptance of Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis systems has been and will continue to be based upon the benefits of tomosynthesis as compared to less expensive technologies. Moreover, as a new technology, there is currently limited, if any, reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We believe that our ability to continue to gain market acceptance of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and follow-on products depends on our ability to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and to secure reimbursement to support the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We are seeking to work with healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in connection with our efforts to promote, and to secure reimbursement for, the use of 3D tomosynthesis. However, we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful. The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products have and will continue to be affected by published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of tomosynthesis, as well as decisions relating to the reimbursement of healthcare providers for the use of the system. The publication of an adverse study, or an adverse decision relating to the reimbursement of the use of tomosynthesis, would likely significantly impair the adoption of this technology and harm our business. Sales of our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system may also be adversely affected by increased competition. Several companies, including Siemens, Giotto, Philips and Planmed, have recently introduced 3D tomosynthesis systems in certain foreign countries. We also are aware that other companies, several of which have substantially greater resources than we have, such as GE and Siemens, are developing 3D tomosynthesis systems for approval in the U.S. Because the markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products are relatively new, it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time.  

Our business may be harmed by the acquisition of Gen-Probe, our other prior acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.  

We have acquired a number of businesses, technologies, product lines and products, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete acquisition transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further, the long-term success of our acquisitions and any additional acquisitions we may complete in the future will depend upon our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. We may fail to realize anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:  

       problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:  

       diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;  

       failure to retain and motivate key employees;  

       failure to successfully oversee international sales efforts and inability to prevent FCPA violations;  

       failure to successfully obtain appropriate regulatory approval or clearance for products under development;  

       failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;  

       failure of customers to accept new products;  

       failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;  

       failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;  

       failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;  

       potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;  

       potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems;  

       potential difficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the SEC; and  

       potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition of such companies, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;  

       we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;  

25  

Table of Contents 

       an acquisition may result in future impairment charges related to a decline in the fair value of the acquired business as compared to the price we paid for such acquisition;  

       an acquisition may involve restructuring operations or reductions in workforce which may result in substantial charges to our operations;  

       our current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with an acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business;  

       an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by shareholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;  

       an acquisition may involve significant deferred or contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources; and  

       the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax decisions and/or changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.  

Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from combining acquired businesses could harm our business and prospects.  

If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or other obligations, or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.  

We will incur significant acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of Gen-Probe.  

We have incurred and expect to incur additional significant costs associated with our acquisition of Gen-Probe and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the acquisition were comprised of transaction costs related to investment banker fees and other professional services as well as systems consolidation costs and business integration and employment-related costs, including costs for severance, retention and other restructuring activities. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.  

Our business may be harmed by the contingent earn out obligations we incurred in connection with our acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.  

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earn out payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period. We also expect that acquisitions we may complete in the future may contain contingent earn out payments, and these payments could be significant. In certain circumstances, such as a change of control, a portion of these obligations may be accelerated. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn out obligations may include covenants to operate the acquired businesses in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us. These provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. Our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances giving rise to the payment and our previous estimates, all or a portion of these payments may be required to be expensed by us when accrued. For example, our contingent earn out obligations payable in connection with the TCT and Healthcome acquisitions will be fully expensed as accrued because our obligation to make these payments is conditioned on the continued employment of certain key employees of TCT and Healthcome. We can give no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to pay our contingent obligations when due, or that such obligations, including the associated covenants relating to the operation of the acquired business, will not otherwise adversely affect our business, liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.  

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving growth.  

Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our growth, including:  

       expanding our product offerings;  

       allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;  

       developing new applications for our technologies;  

26  

Table of Contents 

       strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;  

       acquiring technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services;  

       implementing targeted customer initiatives; and  

       supporting cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of the breadth of our product offerings.  

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business.  

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could harm our business and prospects.  

The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals and clinical laboratories. This consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition and continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, we are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of diagnostics products. Due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest United States laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories.  

Our business is dependent on technologies we license, and if we fail to maintain these licenses or license new technologies and rights to particular nucleic acid sequences for targeted diseases in the future, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.  

Our business is dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. For example, our patented TMA technology is based on technology we licensed from Stanford University. In addition, we have acquired exclusive worldwide diagnostic rights to the PCA3 gene from DiagnoCure, Inc. We anticipate that we will enter into new licensing arrangements in the ordinary course of business to expand our product portfolio and access new technologies to enhance our products and develop new products. Many of these licenses will provide us with exclusive rights to the subject technology or disease marker. If our license with respect to any of these technologies or markers is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to sell products that incorporate the technology. Similarly, we may lose competitive advantages if we fail to maintain exclusivity under an exclusive license.  

Our ability to develop additional diagnostic tests for diseases may depend on the ability of third parties to discover particular sequences or markers and correlate them with disease, as well as the rate at which such discoveries are made. Our ability to design products that target these diseases may depend on our ability to obtain the necessary rights from the third parties that make any of these discoveries. In addition, there are a finite number of diseases and conditions for which our NAT diagnostic assays may be economically viable. If we are unable to access new technologies or the rights to particular sequences or markers necessary for additional diagnostic products on commercially reasonable terms, we may be limited in our ability to develop new diagnostic products.  

Our products and manufacturing processes will require access to technologies and materials that may be subject to patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may need to obtain additional intellectual property rights in order to commercialize our products. We may be unable to obtain such rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.  

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.  

We have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, and copyrights to protect our products and technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe our intellectual property, or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. The pursuit and assertion of a patent right, particularly in areas like nucleic acid diagnostics and biotechnology, involve complex determinations and, therefore, are characterized by substantial uncertainty. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents that do issue will be challenged or invalidated. The patents that we own or license could also be subject to interference proceedings or similar disputes over the priority of the inventions, and an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to the technology from the prevailing party. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in biotechnology. As a result, patents might not issue from certain of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us.

Table of Contents 

We have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology.  

The rights provided by a patent are finite in time. Over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the U.S. and abroad thus allowing third parties to utilize certain of our technologies.  

Our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the U.S. Even if our proprietary information is protected by patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. As a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.  

Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.  

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device, diagnostic products and related industries. We are and have been involved in patent litigation, and may in the future be subject to further claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties.  

In connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.  

Our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.  

We are subject to a number of additional risks and expenses due to our international operations, including our operations in China. Any of these risks or expenses could harm our operating results. These risks and expenses include:  

       difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;  

       protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;  

       difficulties in the collection of trade accounts receivable;  

       difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;  

       expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;  

       possible adverse tax consequences;  

       the inability to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements;  

       the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;  

       governmental currency controls;  

       multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements, international trade regulations and the FCPA);  

       reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  

       political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;  

       the inability to effectively obtain or enforce intellectual property rights and otherwise protect against clone or knock off products; and  

       the lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in China and other foreign countries.

We utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.  

We rely on strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. For example, in our diagnostics business we are dependent on Novartis to distribute the blood screening products we manufacture. Commercial blood screening product sales to Novartis accounted for 36% of Gen-Probes total product sales of $298.0 million for the first six months of Gen-Probes fiscal 2012 and 35% of Gen-Probes total product sales of $562.6 million for Gen-Probes fiscal 2011. In January 2009, Gen-Probe extended the term of its blood screening collaboration with Novartis to June 30, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances specified in the collaboration agreement. If our relationship with Novartis or any of our other strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. If any of our distribution or marketing agreements are terminated, particularly our collaboration agreement with Novartis, or if we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales and marketing resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would significantly increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. We may not be able to enter into new distribution or marketing agreements on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into acceptable distribution or marketing agreements or fail to successfully market our products, our product sales will decrease. We may also be exposed to risks as a result of transitioning a territory from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers, hiring appropriately trained personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements, any of which could result in lower revenues than previously received from the distributor in that territory.  

Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.  

We maintain sales and service offices outside the United States, have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Canada, China, Costa Rica, England and Germany, and conduct business worldwide. The expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies, except at our Costa Rica subsidiary, where the majority of business is conducted in U.S. dollars. Our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the Euro or U.S. dollar. Historically, a majority of our sales of capital equipment to international dealers have been denominated in U.S. dollars; however, in the second half of fiscal 2010 we began to invoice more of our European sales in the Euro.  

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency. In the last few years we have not hedged foreign currency exposures, but we may in the future hedge foreign currency denominated sales. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. This reliance could harm our business and prospects.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials, components or subassemblies for our products. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. Any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales.  

Our current supplier of certain key raw materials for certain of our amplified NAT diagnostic assays, pursuant to a fixed-price contract, is Roche Molecular Biochemicals. We have a supply and purchase agreement for oligonucleotides for HPV with Roche Molecular Systems. Each of these entities is an affiliate of Roche Diagnostics GmbH, which is one of our primary competitors in molecular diagnostics.  

We have only one third-party manufacturer for each of our molecular diagnostics instrument product lines, which exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.  

We have one third-party manufacturer for each of our molecular diagnostics instrument product lines. KMC Systems, Inc., or KMC Systems, is the only manufacturer of the TIGRIS instrument; Stratec Biomedical Systems AG, or Stratec, is the only manufacturer of the PANTHER instrument; and Tecan Group Ltd., or Tecan, is the only manufacturer of the Cervista High Throughput Automation System. We are dependent on these third-party manufacturers, and this dependence exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.  

29  

Table of Contents 

We have no firm long-term commitments from KMC Systems, Stratec, Tecan or any of our other contract manufacturers to supply products to us for any specific period, or in any specific quantity, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. If KMC Systems, Stratec, Tecan or any of our other third-party manufacturers experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its development or manufacturing operations or becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to supply us with products in sufficient quantities, then instrument shipments to our customers could be delayed, which would decrease our revenues and harm our competitive position and reputation. Further, because we place orders with our manufacturers based on forecasts of expected demand for our instruments, if we inaccurately forecast demand we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity or adequate quantities of components to meet our customers delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories.  

We may in the future need to find new contract manufacturers to replace existing suppliers, increase our volumes or reduce our costs. We may not be able to find contract manufacturers that meet our needs, and even if we do, qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming. If we are required or elect to change contract manufacturers, we may lose revenues and our customer relationships may suffer.  

We may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with our planned consolidation of operations and facilities that could materially harm our business and prospects.  

We continually review our operations and facilities in an effort to reduce costs and increase efficiencies and currently plan to consolidate several of our operations and facilities, including:  

       the consolidation of our selenium panel coating production line, currently located in Germany, into our digital detector manufacturing facility in Newark, Delaware;  

       the consolidation of our breast biopsy operations, including manufacturing, research and development and sales support, currently located in Indianapolis, Indiana, into our Costa Rica manufacturing facility and our headquarters facilities in Massachusetts; and  

       the consolidation of our Madison, Wisconsin molecular diagnostics operations into our Gen-Probe facilities in San Diego, California.  

We expect these consolidations to be completed over various periods of time through calendar 2014.  

Uncertainty is inherent within the consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances, costs and expenses could offset the anticipated benefits, disrupt operations, including the timely delivery of products and service to customers, and impact product quality. In addition, we may fail to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and who we are depending upon for the timely and successful transition, we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers at the new locations to handle the additional production and other demands, and the relocation may absorb significant management and key employee attention and resources. If any of these risks materialize, our business, result of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.  

We face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.  

A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. Some of our competitors are large companies that may enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including:  

       significantly greater name recognition;  

       larger or more established distribution networks;  

       additional product lines, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;  

       higher levels of automation and more substantial installed bases of such equipment;  

       more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and financial capabilities; and  

       greater financial resources allowing them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.  

The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, and these competitive pressures may reduce our gross margins. Other companies may develop products that are superior to or less expensive, or both, than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introductions of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.

The current environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, together with current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures, may put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes.  

If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.  

Because Gen-Probe has historically depended on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its product sales, the loss of any of these customers or any cancellation or delay of a large purchase by any of these customers could significantly reduce our revenues.  

Historically, a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of Gen-Probes product sales, and Gen-Probe does not have any long-term commitments with these customers, other than pursuant to its collaboration agreement with Novartis. Product sales from Gen-Probes blood screening collaboration with Novartis accounted for 36% of its total product sales of $298.0 million for the first six months of Gen-Probes fiscal 2012 and 35% of its total product sales of $562.6 million for Gen-Probes fiscal 2011. Gen-Probes blood screening collaboration with Novartis is largely dependent on two significant customers in the United States, The American Red Cross and Creative Testing Solutions, although Gen-Probe does not receive any revenues directly from those entities. Novartis was Gen-Probes only customer that accounted for greater than 10% of its total revenues during the first six months of its fiscal 2012 and 2011. We anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend, to a significant extent, upon revenues from a small number of customers. The loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales volume or pricing to those customers, could significantly reduce our revenues.  

Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.  

The markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. These trends will likely continue into the foreseeable future. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasingly challenging customer requirements and gain market acceptance. If we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.  

We will likely continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may reduce our profitability.  

Historically, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the development and improvement of our products and technologies. We expect that research and development expenditures will remain high as we seek to expand our product offerings and continue to develop and improve products and technologies. As a result, we will need to continue to generate significant revenues to maintain current levels of profitability. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to maintain current levels of profitability in the future.  

Our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation.  

Our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:  

       the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;  

       the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;  

       the development status and demand for our products;  

       the development status and demand for therapies to treat the health concerns addressed by our products and treatments;  

       economic conditions in our markets;  

       foreign exchange rates;  

       the timing of orders;  

       the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;  

       the mix of products we sell and markets we serve;  

       regulatory approval of products;  

31  

Table of Contents 

       the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       pricing and other competitive conditions;  

       unanticipated expenses;  

       complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP;  

       asset impairments;  

       contingent consideration charges;  

       restructuring and consolidation charges; and  

       seasonality of sales of certain of our products.  

Customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.  

Recent changes to reclassify full-field digital mammography to permit 510(k) clearance could increase competition for our digital mammography products.  

The FDA has changed the classification of 2D digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II. As a result, these 2D digital mammography systems will require a 510(k) submission rather than a PMA, which will make it easier for other mammography vendors to gain approval of such systems in the United States. As a result, we anticipate that competition in the digital mammography market will intensify as more companies and products enter this market.  

Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false or fraudulent claims.  

We are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. Similarly, our international operations are subject to the provisions of the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices is constantly evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects. Moreover, our failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.  

New regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.  

On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The new rule, which is effective for calendar 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31, 2014, will require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.  

In the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any such compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could adversely affect our business.  

We are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products.  

Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that products competitive position in the market.  

The sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, inaccurate test results or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of managements attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, and could harm our business and prospects.  

We use hazardous materials and products.  

Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. We are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.  

We may incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage.  

Our insurance coverage includes product liability, property, fire, terrorism and business interruption policies. Our insurance coverage contains policy limits, specifications and exclusions. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. Nonetheless, we may incur losses of a type for which we are not covered by insurance or which exceed the limits of liability of our insurance policies. In that event, we could experience a significant loss which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.  

Our future success depends on the continued services of key personnel.  

The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or strategic objectives. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel, particularly software engineers and other technical personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.

Our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects.  

We have entered into alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships. Alliances with certain partners or companies could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Moreover, we may not be able to:  

       identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures;  

       assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support we anticipated;  

       successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us; or  

       successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.  

Furthermore, any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture, failing to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively, or failing to comply with the obligations associated with an alliance or joint venture, could harm our business and prospects.  

An adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate, including the continuation of the current financial and economic uncertainty, could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.  

At least annually, we review the carrying value of our goodwill, and for other long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. Conditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate an evaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. In addition, the deterioration of a companys market capitalization significantly below its net book value is an indicator of impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. As a result of this assessment, we recorded significant impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal 2009 and 2010.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for our reporting units, and recorded a $5.8 million goodwill impairment charge for our MammoSite reporting unit. All other reporting units passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Although we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. It is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic uncertainty could negatively affect our anticipated future cash flows, or the discount rates used to value the cash flows for each reporting unit, to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test in fiscal 2013.  

The acquisition of Gen-Probe is expected to have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock following the acquisition.  

The acquisition of Gen-Probe is expected to have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets in connection with the acquisition. These expectations are based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change as a result of the completion of the allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition. We could also encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. Any of these factors could cause further dilution to our earnings per share or cause a decrease in the price of our common stock.  

Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the acquisition of Gen-Probe.  

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting, resulting in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock. Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocated the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Gen-Probe based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, and recorded any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. For certain tangible and intangible assets, recording their fair values as of the acquisition date results in incurring significant additional depreciation and/or amortization expense that exceeds the combined amounts recorded by us and Gen-Probe prior to the acquisition. This increased expense is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. In addition, to the extent the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets post-acquisition were to become impaired, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets.

Our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.  

We are subject to income taxes and non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We take certain income tax return positions for which we provide additional taxes if it is more-likely-than-not that they will not withstand a tax authoritys challenge. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly evaluate the audits likely outcomes in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and tax reserves. However, we cannot give assurance that we will accurately predict the audits outcomes, which could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition.  

Our effective tax rate may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic profitability mix and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have a material impact on our business and operating results.  

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. U.S. law makers are considering several U.S. corporate tax reform proposals including those that may reduce or eliminate U.S. income tax deferral on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminate tax incentives such as the domestic manufacturing deduction in exchange for a lower U.S. statutory tax rate.  

Risks Relating to our Indebtedness  

We incurred significant indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of Gen-Probe, which will limit our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.  

As of September 29, 2012, following the acquisition of Gen-Probe, we had approximately $5.2 billion aggregate principal of indebtedness. We also have other contractual obligations and deferred tax liabilities. This significant level of indebtedness and our other obligations may:  

       make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;  

       increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;  

       require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;  

       limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  

       place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  

       limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.  

In addition, the terms of our financing obligations require us to meet certain financial covenants that are customary with these types of credit facilities, which are described in Note 5 Borrowings and Credit Arrangements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, we could default under the credit facilities, which could cause us to be unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facilities and may result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding indebtedness under the facilities. If the maturities were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment, and if we were unable to borrow further under the facilities, we may not be able to make investments in our business to support our strategy or we may end up in bankruptcy proceedings, or other processes, in which our business would be negatively impacted. In addition, our shareholders could be adversely impacted as shareholder value could decrease to a point of limited return. Each scenario would result in significant negative implications to our liquidity and results of operations.  

In addition, the terms of our financing obligations contain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:  

       incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;  

       pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments;  

       make certain investments;  

       agree to payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries;  

       sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;  

       enter into transactions with our affiliates;  

       create liens;

       designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;  

       consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; and  

       use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets.  

Our new senior secured credit facilities also require us to satisfy certain financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the new credit facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt, including the Senior Notes. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default or a change of control, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.  

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.  

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  

Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we can give no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this occurs, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.  

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds from asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.  

A significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.  

A significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. As of September 29, 2012, approximately $2.5 billion aggregate principal of our indebtedness, which represents the outstanding principal under our tranche A term loan facility and our tranche B term loan facility, was subject to floating interest rates. We currently have no hedging arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates.  

Risks Relating to our Common Stock  

Future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes.  

Any future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.  

In addition, the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of our convertible notes, or any common stock that note holders receive upon conversion of their notes.

Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.  

Future sales of our common stock, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock for future sale could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In addition, we may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options or for other reasons.  

Provisions in our charter, bylaws, indebtedness and stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  

Our charter, bylaws, and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control of us. Our indebtedness also contains provisions which either accelerate or require us to offer to repurchase the indebtedness at a premium upon a change of control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.  

Our stock price is volatile.  

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:  

       new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;  

       announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;  

       published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;  

       quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;  

       general conditions in the worldwide economy;  

       announcements of technological innovations;  

       new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;  

       developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;  

       the implementation of healthcare reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future, and;  

       the success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions.  

The price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of high-tech companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.
