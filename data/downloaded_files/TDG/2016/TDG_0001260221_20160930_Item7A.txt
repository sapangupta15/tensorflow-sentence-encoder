ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At September 30, 2016, we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately $5,235 million that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our term loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the Company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately $52 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on the $5,235 million of borrowings under our term loans on September 30, 2016 was 4.2%. 

Interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in Note 20, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

For information about the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans and the fair value of the Notes, see Note 19, “Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
