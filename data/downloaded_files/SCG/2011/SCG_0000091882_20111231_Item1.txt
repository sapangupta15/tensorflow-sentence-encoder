CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

SCANAs regulated subsidiaries, including SCE&G, require cash to fund operations, construction programs and dividend payments to SCANA. SCANAs nonregulated subsidiaries require cash to fund operations and dividend payments to SCANA. To replace existing plant investment and to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, SCANAs regulated subsidiaries must attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, when requested. 

For a discussion of various rate matters and their impact on capital requirements, see the Regulatory Matters section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G. 

During the period 2012-2014, SCANA and SCE&G expect to meet capital requirements through internally generated funds, issuance of equity and short-term and long-term borrowings. SCANA and SCE&G expect that they have or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet their projected cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

For a discussion of cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures, contractual cash obligations, financing limits, financing transactions and other related information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCANAs ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 2.87, 2.92, 2.84, 3.04 and 3.03 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. SCE&Gs ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 3.13, 3.18, 3.25, 3.51 and 3.40 for the same periods. 

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS 

Electric Sales 

SCE&Gs sales of electricity and margins earned from the sale of electricity by customer classification as percentages of electric revenues for 2010 and 2011 were as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Sales for resale include sales to three municipalities and two electric cooperatives. Sales under NMST during 2011 include sales to seven investor-owned utilities or registered marketers and three federal/state electric agencies. During 2010 sales under the NMST included sales to nine investor-owned utilities or registered marketers, two electric cooperatives and two federal/state electric agencies. 

During 2011 SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 3,600 electric customers (growth rate of 0.5%), increasing its total electric customers to approximately 664,000 at year end. 

For the period 2012-2014, SCE&G projects total territorial KWh sales of electricity to increase 0.7% annually (assuming normal weather), total electric customer base to increase 1.6% annually and territorial peak load (summer, in MW) to increase 1.0% annually. While SCE&Gs goal is to maintain a reserve margin of between 12% and 18%, weather and other factors affect territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any given day to fall below the reserve margin goal.

Electric Interconnections 

SCE&G purchases all of the electric generation of GENCOs Williams Station under a Unit Power Sales Agreement which has been approved by FERC. Williams Station has a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 605 MW. 

SCE&Gs transmission system, which extends over a large part of the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina, interconnects with Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Santee Cooper, Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation and the Southeastern Power Administrations Clarks Hill (Thurmond) Project. SCE&G, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, Santee Cooper, Dominion Virginia Power and ALCOA Power Generating, Inc. (Yadkin Division), are members of VACAR, one of several geographic divisions within the SERC. SERC is one of eight regional entities with delegated authority from NERC for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards approved by FERC. SERC is divided geographically into five diverse sub-regions that are identified as Central, Delta, Gateway, Southeastern and VACAR. The regional entities and all members of NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America. For a discussion of the impact certain legislative and regulatory initiatives may have on SCE&Gs transmission system, see Electric Operations within the Overview section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Six of the seven fossil fuel-fired plants use coal. Unit trains and, in some cases, trucks and barges deliver coal to these plants. 

Coal is obtained through long-term supply contracts and spot market purchases. Long-term contracts exist with suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 3.5 million tons annually, which is substantially all expected coal purchases for 2012. Sulfur restrictions on the contract coal range from 1% to 2%. These contracts expire at various times through 2014. Spot market purchases are expected to continue when needed or when prices are believed to be favorable. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that SCE&Gs operations comply with all applicable regulations relating to the discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. See additional discussion at Environmental Matters in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

On January 27, 2011, SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, Westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&Gs exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 passive reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. Westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Summer Station Unit 1 under a services alliance arrangement, and SCE&G has also contracted for Westinghouse to provide similar support services to the New Units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation. 

In addition to the above-described contracts for fuel fabrication and related services, SCE&G has contracts covering its nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services and enrichment services. These contracts have varying expiration dates in the next 11 years. SCE&G believes that it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services and that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment of normal operations of its nuclear generating units. 

SCE&G can store spent nuclear fuel on-site until at least 2017 and expects to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Summer Station Unit 1 through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. In addition, Summer Station Unit 1 has sufficient on-site storage capacity to permit storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete unloading should become desirable or necessary. For information about the contract with the DOE regarding disposal of spent fuel, see Hazardous and Solid Wastes within the Environmental Matters section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

GAS OPERATIONS 

Gas Sales-Regulated 

Regulated sales of natural gas by customer classification as a percent of total regulated gas revenues sold or transported for 2010 and 2011 were as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the three-year period 2012-2014, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in DTs to increase 0.9% annually (assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in DT sales include residential of 1.2%, commercial of 0.9% and industrial of 0.8%. 

For the three-year period 2012-2014, SCE&G projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in DTs to increase 0.4% annually (assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in DT sales include residential of 0.4%, commercial of 0.3% and industrial of 1.1%. 

For the three-year period 2012-2014, SCANAs and SCE&Gs total consolidated regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase annually 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. During 2011 SCANA recorded a net increase of approximately 8,800 regulated gas customers (growth rate of 1.1%), increasing its regulated gas customers to approximately 804,000. Of this increase, SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 3,300 gas customers (growth rate of 1.1%), increasing its total gas customers to approximately 317,000 (as of December 31, 2011). 

Demand for gas changes primarily due to the effect of weather and the price relationship between gas and alternate fuels.

Gas Cost, Supply and Curtailment Plans 

South Carolina 

SCE&G purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers in both the spot and long-term markets. The gas is delivered to South Carolina through firm transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2013), Transco (expiring in 2013 and 2017) and CGT (expiring in 2012, 2023 and 2026). The maximum daily volume of gas that SCE&G is entitled to transport under these contracts is 161,144 DT from Southern Natural, 64,652 DT from Transco and 424,429 DT from CGT. Additional natural gas volumes may be delivered to SCE&Gs system as capacity is available through interruptible transportation. 

The daily volume of gas that SEMI is entitled to transport under its service agreement with CGT (expiring in 2023) on a firm basis is 78,083 DT. 

SCE&G purchased natural gas at an average cost of $5.88 per MCF during 2011 and $6.38 per MCF during 2010. 

SCE&G was allocated 5,437 MMCF of natural gas storage capacity on Southern Natural and Transco. Approximately 4,213 MMCF of gas were in storage on December 31, 2011. To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, SCE&G supplements its supplies of natural gas with two LNG liquefaction and storage facilities. The LNG plants are capable of storing the liquefied equivalent of 1,880 MMCF of natural gas. Approximately 1,759 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage on December 31, 2011. 

North Carolina 

PSNC Energy purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a short-term basis at current prices and on a long-term basis for reliability assurance at index prices plus a reservation charge. Transco and Dominion deliver the gas to North Carolina through transportation agreements with expiration dates ranging through 2016. On a peak day, PSNC Energy may transport daily volumes of gas under these contracts on a firm basis of 281,110 DT from Transco and 7,331 DT from Dominion. 

PSNC Energy purchased natural gas at an average cost of $5.54 per DT during 2011 compared to $5.95 per DT during 2010. 

To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking services. Underground natural gas storage service agreements with Dominion, Columbia Gas Transmission, Transco and Spectra Energy provide for storage capacity of approximately 13,000 MMCF. Approximately 12,000 MMCF of gas were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2011. In addition, PSNC Energys LNG facility can store the liquefied equivalent of 1,000 MMCF of natural gas with regasification capability of approximately 100 MMCF per day. Approximately 800 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at December 31, 2011. LNG storage service agreements with Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG provide for 1,300 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of storage space. Approximately 1,200 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2011. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to accommodate growth. 

Gas Marketing-Nonregulated 

SEMI markets natural gas and provides energy-related risk management services primarily in the Southeast. In addition, SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, markets natural gas to approximately 455,000 customers (as of December 31, 2011) in Georgias natural gas market. SCANA Energys total customer base represents an approximate 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At the termination of a license under the Federal Power Act, FERC may extend or issue a new license to the previous licensee, may issue a license to another applicant, or the federal government may take over the related project. If the federal government takes over a project or if FERC issues a license to another applicant, the federal government or the new licensee, as the case may be, must pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project, not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages. 

For a discussion of legislative and regulatory initiatives being implemented that will affect SCE&Gs transmission system, see Electric Operations within the Overview section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCE&G is subject to regulation by the NRC with respect to the ownership, construction, operation and decommissioning of its currently operating and planned nuclear generating facilities. The NRCs jurisdiction encompasses broad supervisory and regulatory powers over the construction and operation of nuclear reactors, including matters of health and safety, antitrust considerations and environmental impact. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reviews, in conjunction with the NRC, certain aspects of emergency planning relating to the operation of nuclear plants. 

RATE MATTERS 

For a discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G, and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCE&Gs gas rate schedules for its residential, small commercial and small industrial customers include a WNA approved by the SCPSC, which is in effect for bills rendered for billing cycles in November through April. The WNA increases tariff rates if weather is warmer than normal and decreases rates if weather is colder than normal. The WNA does not change the seasonality of gas revenues, but reduces fluctuations in revenues and earnings caused by abnormal weather. 

SCE&Gs retail electric rates include certain costs associated with the Companys DSM Programs as authorized by the SCPSC. More specifically, these costs include the costs and lost net margin revenue associated with DSM Programs, along with an incentive for investing in such programs. In August 2010, SCE&G implemented an eWNA on a one-year pilot basis for its electric customers and it will continue on a pilot basis unless modified or terminated by the SCPSC. 

PSNC Energy is authorized by the NCUC to utilize a CUT which allows PSNC Energy to adjust its base rates semi-annually for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer consumption whether impacted by weather or other factors. 

Under the BLRA, SCE&G is allowed to file revised rates with the SCPSC each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation. Requested rate adjustments are based on SCE&Gs updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 11%. In September 2011, the SCPSC approved an increase of $52.8 million or 2.4% under the BLRA for the annual revised rates adjustment filing. The new retail electric rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30, 2011. 

In February 2009, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs combined application pursuant to the BLRA seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review order relating to the proposed construction and operation by SCE&G and Santee Cooper of the New Units at Summer Station. Under the BLRA, the SCPSC conducted a full pre-construction prudency review of the proposed units and the engineering, procurement, and construction contract under which they are being built. The SCPSC prudency finding is binding on all future related rate proceedings so long as the construction proceeds in accordance with schedules, estimates and projections, as approved by the SCPSC.

Table of Contents 

In May 2009, two intervenors filed separate appeals of the SCPSC order with the South Carolina Supreme Court. With regard to the first appeal, which challenged the SCPSCs prudency finding, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion on April 26, 2010, affirming the decision of the SCPSC. As for the second appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the SCPSCs decision to allow SCE&G to include a pre-approved cost contingency fund and associated inflation (contingency reserve) as part of its anticipated capital costs allowed under the BLRA. SCE&Gs share of the project, as originally approved by the SCPSC, was $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars. Approximately $438 million represented contingency costs associated with the project. Without the pre-approved contingency reserve, SCE&G must seek SCPSC approval for the recovery of any additional capital costs. The Courts ruling, however, did not affect the project schedule or disturb the SCPSCs issuance of a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity, which is required to construct the New Units. On November 15, 2010, SCE&G filed a petition with the SCPSC seeking an order approving an updated capital cost schedule that reflected the removal of the contingency reserve and incorporated then identifiable capital costs of $173.9 million (in 2007 dollars), and by order dated May 16, 2011, the SCPSC approved the updated capital costs schedule as outlined in the petition. 

On February 29, 2012, SCE&G filed a petition with the SCPSC seeking an order approving a further updated capital cost and construction schedule that incorporates additional identifiable capital costs of approximately $6 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to new federal healthcare laws, information security measures and certain minor design modifications. That petition also includes increased capital costs of approximately $12 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to transmission infrastructure. Finally, that petition includes amounts of approximately $137 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to additional labor for the oversight of the New Units during construction and for preparing to operate the New Units, facilities and information technology systems required to support the New Units and their personnel. Future petitions would be filed for any costs arising from the resolution of the commercial claims discussed in the OTHER MATTERS  Nuclear Generation section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements (e.g., those related to COL delays, design modifications of the shield building and certain pre-fabricated modules for the New Units and unanticipated rock conditions at the site). 

Fuel Cost Recovery Procedures 

The SCPSCs fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in SCE&Gs retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any over-collection or under-collection from the preceding 12-month period. The statutory definition of fuel costs includes certain variable environmental costs, such as ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and particulates. SCE&G may request a formal proceeding concerning its fuel costs at any time should circumstances dictate such a review. 

SCE&Gs retail electric rates are established in part using a cost of fuel component approved by the SCPSC which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the price of fuel purchased by SCE&G. In February 2011, SCE&G requested authorization to increase the cost of fuel component of its retail electric rates to be effective with the first billing cycle of May 2011. On March 17, 2011, SCE&G, ORS and SCEUC entered into a settlement agreement in which SCE&G agreed to recover its actual base fuel under-collected balance as of April 30, 2011 over a two-year period commencing with the first billing cycle of May 2011. The settlement agreement also provided that SCE&G would be allowed to charge and accrue carrying costs monthly on the deferred balance. By order dated April 26, 2011, the SCPSC approved the settlement agreement. The next annual hearing to review base rates for fuel costs is scheduled for March 22, 2012. 

SCE&Gs natural gas tariffs include a PGA clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred, including costs related to hedging natural gas purchasing activities. SCE&Gs gas rates are calculated using a methodology which may adjust the cost of gas monthly based on a 12-month rolling average. The annual PGA hearing to review SCE&Gs gas purchasing policies and procedures was conducted in November 2011 before the SCPSC. The SCPSC issued an order in January 2012 finding that SCE&Gs gas purchasing policies and practices during the review period of August 1, 2010 through July 31, 2011, were reasonable and prudent and authorized the suspension of SCE&Gs natural gas hedging program. 

PSNC Energy is subject to a Rider D rate mechanism which allows it to recover from customers all prudently incurred gas costs and certain uncollectible expenses related to gas cost. The Rider D rate mechanism also allows it to recover, in any manner authorized by the NCUC, losses on negotiated gas and transportation sales. 

14 

Table of Contents 

PSNC Energys rates are established using a benchmark cost of gas approved by the NCUC, which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the market price of natural gas. PSNC Energy revises its tariffs with the NCUC as necessary to track these changes and accounts for any over- or under-collections of the delivered cost of gas in its deferred accounts for subsequent rate consideration. The NCUC reviews PSNC Energys gas purchasing practices annually.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Federal and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and hazardous waste management. Developments in these areas may require that equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or replaced. The ultimate effect of these regulations and standards upon existing and proposed operations cannot be predicted. For a more complete discussion of how these regulations and standards impact SCANA and SCE&G, see the Environmental Matters section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.
