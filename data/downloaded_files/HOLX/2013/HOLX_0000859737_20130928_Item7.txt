Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the information described under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  

OVERVIEW  

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products with an emphasis on serving the healthcare needs of women. Our core business units are focused on diagnostics, breast health, GYN surgical and skeletal health. On August 1, 2012, we completed our acquisition of Gen-Probe, which is part of our Diagnostics business segment.  

We offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases and screen donated human blood. Our molecular diagnostics products include our Aptima family of assays, our proprietary Invader and TMA chemistries and our advanced instrumentation (Panther, Tigris and HTA). The Aptima family of assays is used to detect the infectious microorganisms that cause the common STDs chlamydia and gonorrhea, certain high-risk strains of HPV, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis. Our Invader chemistry is comprised of molecular diagnostic reagents used for a variety of DNA and RNA analysis applications, including our Cervista HPV HR and Cervista HPV 16/18 products to assist in the diagnosis of HPV, as well as other products to diagnose cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular risk and other diseases. Our diagnostics products also include the ThinPrep System, which is primarily used in cytology applications such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test, which assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. In blood screening, we develop and manufacture the Procleix family of assays, which are used to detect HIV, HCV, HBV, WNV, HAV and Parvovirus in donated human blood. These blood screening products are marketed worldwide by our blood screening collaborator, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., under Novartis trademarks. On November 11, 2013, Novartis announced that it is selling its blood screening business to Grifols. Grifols had previously been a customer of our collaboration with Novartis. As announced, the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2014. Upon the consummation of that transaction, Grifols will replace Novartis as our blood screening collaborator.  

Our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, breast MRI coils, CAD for mammography and minimally invasive breast biopsy devices, breast biopsy site markers, breast biopsy guidance systems, breast imaging comfort pads, and breast brachytherapy products. Our most advanced breast imaging platform, Dimensions, utilizes a new technology called tomosynthesis to produce 3D images, as well as conventional 2D full field digital mammography images.  

Our GYN surgical products include our NovaSure system and MyoSure system. The NovaSure system involves a trans-cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The MyoSure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision-less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we decided to cease manufacturing, marketing and selling our Adiana permanent contraception system determining that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future.  

Our skeletal health products include dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry systems, an ultrasound-based osteoporosis assessment product, and our Fluoroscan mini C-arm imaging products.  

Unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, Hologic or our company refer to Hologic, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  

Market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs, private insurers or other healthcare payors. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, known as CMS, establish coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Under current CMS policies, varying reimbursement levels have been established for certain of our products and treatments. Coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payor decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by CMS. The use of our products and treatments outside the United States is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and private insurance carriers. CMS has not adopted a reimbursement rate for the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We are working with governmental authorities, healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in our efforts to secure reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis. However, we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Failure to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis could adversely affect sales of our Dimensions 3D systems.  

The continuing uncertainty surrounding worldwide financial markets and macroeconomic conditions has caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease or delay their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments have resulted and may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness, which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. If the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.  

In March 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and imposes new and/or increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of certain medical devices effective January 1, 2013. The majority of our products fall under the government classification requiring the excise tax. Product sales in the United States represented 74% and 73% of our worldwide net product sales for the years ended September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively. Since the effective date of the medical device excise tax through September 28, 2013, the Company has incurred $15.7 million of excise tax expense related to the domestic sales of its medical device products. The law also includes new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, as well as stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between medical device manufacturers and physicians and hospitals. We expect compliance with the new healthcare legislation, including these new reporting requirements and the new excise tax, to impose significant additional administrative and financial burdens on us. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level and in various foreign countries. The healthcare reform legislation and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the excise tax has increased our cost of doing business. These reforms, cost containment measures and new taxes, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.  

We operate in a highly regulated industry and other governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including, without limitation: new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, methods of delivery and payment for health care products and services; changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval  

58  

Table of Contents 

 processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, any of which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices; and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations, including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above.  

Professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related preventative services and treatments/therapies. Recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased reimbursement or use of our products. For example, in November 2012, the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, known as the ACOG, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in March 2012 by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, known as the USPSTF, and the American Cancer Society. However, the USPSTF recommendations now also include HPV co-testing for certain patient populations, an update from their draft guidelines in October 2011. Overall, we believe that these guidelines have contributed to an increase in testing intervals in the U.S. for cervical cancer screening, resulting in fewer such tests being performed.  

Over the last few years, there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The ongoing fluctuations of the value of the U.S. dollar may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time. Historically, a majority of our capital equipment sales to international dealers were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, more sales are now denominated in the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar for our Euro zone dealers. In addition, we have international sales, principally in our Diagnostics segment, that are denominated in foreign currencies. The value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar. Given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets, foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future and we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results.  

ACQUISITIONS  

Fiscal 2013 Acquisitions:  

Chindex Medical Limited  

On December 31, 2012, we acquired certain assets from Chindex Medical Limited for a net purchase price of $4.4 million, including contingent consideration. Chindex was a distributor of certain of our Breast Health products in China. We accounted for this transaction as the acquisition of a business pursuant to ASC 805 and allocated the majority of the purchase price to customer relationships.  

SenoRx, Inc.  

On May 31, 2013, through the settlement of litigation, we acquired certain assets related to SenoRxs Contura brachytherapy device for a net purchase price of $2.4 million. We accounted for this transaction as the acquisition of a business pursuant to ASC 805 and allocated the majority of the purchase price to developed technology.

Fiscal 2012 Acquisitions:  

Gen-Probe Incorporated  

On August 1, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Gen-Probe and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Gen-Probe. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition was cancelled and converted into the right to receive $82.75 in cash. In addition, all outstanding restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, and those stock options granted prior to February 8, 2012 were cancelled and converted into the right to receive $82.75 per share in cash less the exercise price, as applicable. Stock options granted after February 8, 2012 were cancelled and converted into stock options to acquire shares of Hologic common stock determined by a conversion formula defined in the merger agreement. The total purchase price was $3.97 billion, which was funded through available cash and financing consisting of senior secured credit facilities and senior notes resulting in aggregate proceeds of $3.48 billion, net of discounts.  

The allocation of the purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of August 1, 2012. The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on managements estimate of their fair values. Certain of Gen-Probes assets were designated as assets held-for-sale and recorded at fair value less the estimated cost to sell such assets and were disposed of in fiscal 2013. These represented non-core assets to our business plan.  

As part of the purchase price allocation, we determined the identifiable intangible assets were developed technology of $1.7 billion, in-process research and development of $117.0 million, customer contracts of $585.0 million, and trade names of $95.0 million. The fair value of the intangible assets was estimated using the income approach, specifically the excess earning method and relief from royalty method, and the cash flow projections were discounted using rates ranging from 10% to 12%. The cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model and the weighted average cost of capital.  

The developed technology assets comprised know-how, patents and technologies embedded in Gen-Probes products and related to currently marketed products and related instrument automation. In valuing the developed technology assets consideration was only given to products that had received regulatory approval. In-process research and development projects relate to in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and have no alternative future use. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying product, which primarily pertains to receiving approval to perform certain diagnostic testing on Gen-Probes instrumentation, such as the Panther and Tigris systems. We recorded $117.0 million of in-process research and development projects related to six projects. Three projects valued at $93.0 million received FDA approval in fiscal 2013 and were transferred to developed technology. The other projects are expected to be completed over the next four years with a total estimated cost of approximately $49.0 million to complete such projects. Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction, we can give no assurance that any of our product development efforts will be successful, completed on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. All of the in-process research and development assets were valued using the multiple-period excess earnings method approach using a discount rate of 12.0%.  

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired of $1.64 billion was recorded to goodwill. The factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill were based on several strategic and synergistic benefits that were expected to be realized from the Gen-Probe acquisition. These benefits included the expectation that the combined companys complementary products in the molecular diagnostics market with Gen-Probes fully automated product franchise would significantly broaden the Companys offering in womens health and diagnostics. The combined company should benefit from a broader global presence and with Hologics direct sales force and marketing in Europe and its investment in China distribution, the growth prospects of Gen-Probes products are expected to be enhanced significantly. The combined company anticipates significant cross-selling opportunities within the diagnostics market through Hologics larger channel coverage and physician sales team. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Gen-Probes revenue and pre-tax loss from continuing operations for the period from the acquisition date to September 29, 2012 were $89.5 million and $47.7 million, respectively.  

Fiscal 2011 Acquisitions:  

TCT International Co., Ltd.  

On June 1, 2011, we acquired TCT International Co., Ltd., or TCT, a privately-held distributor of medical products, including our ThinPrep Pap Test, related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products. TCTs operating subsidiaries are located in Beijing, China. Our acquisition of TCT enabled us to obtain an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in China as we execute on our strategy to expand internationally. The purchase price was $148.4 million. In addition, the majority of the former shareholders of TCT were eligible to receive two annual contingent earn-out payments (subject to adjustment) not to exceed $200.0 million less a deferred payment of $35.0 million, which was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Subsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of TCT, which are primarily reported within our Diagnostics reporting segment and to a lesser extent within our GYN Surgical reporting segment.  

The contingent earn-out payments were based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth for the one year periods beginning January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012 as compared to the respective prior year periods. Since these payments were contingent on future employment, they were recognized as compensation expense ratably over the required service periods. Based on actual and projected revenues for the TCT business, we recorded compensation expense of $80.0 million, $75.5 million and $17.6 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The first earn-out period was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and we paid $54 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The second earn-out period was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and we paid $87.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. As of September 28, 2013, we had accrued $31.7 million, which we paid in November 2013.  

Interlace Medical, Inc.  

On January 6, 2011, we acquired Interlace Medical, Inc., or Interlace, a privately-held company located in Framingham, Massachusetts. Interlace is the developer, manufacturer and supplier of the MyoSure system. The purchase price was comprised of $126.8 million in cash, which was net of certain adjustments, plus two annual contingent payments up to a maximum of an additional $225.0 million in cash. Subsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of Interlace, which has been integrated within our GYN Surgical reporting segment.  

The agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of a portion of legal expenses in defense of the Interlace intellectual property. We have the right to collect certain amounts set aside in escrow from the initial consideration and, as applicable, offset contingent consideration payments with qualifying legal costs.  

The contingent payments were based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during a two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. Pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, we recorded this liability at its estimated fair value based on future revenue projections of the Interlace business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes. As of the date of acquisition, these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of 15.6%, based on the weighted-average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non-performance risk related to the liability pursuant to ASC 820. This analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of $86.6 million, which was adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in the fair value of the liability due to the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones. This fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. During  

61

 the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the first measurement period lapsed resulting in a total contingent consideration amount recorded for this period of $51.8 million, which was disbursed to the former shareholders of Interlace net of amounts withheld for certain legal indemnification purposes. The final measurement period ended during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, resulting in a contingent consideration liability of $93.8 million, of which, $86.9 million was paid to the former Interlace stockholders in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The remainder was withheld for legal indemnification provisions and is being used to pay qualifying legal expenses. We recorded charges of $11.3 million, $41.8 million and $6.3 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.  

Beijing Healthcome Technology Company, Ltd.  

On July 19, 2011, we completed our acquisition of Beijing Healthcome Technology Company, Ltd., or Healthcome, a privately-held manufacturer of medical equipment, including mammography equipment, located in Beijing, China. Healthcome develops and manufactures analog mammography products targeted to lower tier hospital segments in China. The purchase price was $8.8 million in cash. In addition, we were obligated to make future payments to the shareholders, who remained employed, up to an additional $7.1 million over three years. Since these payments were contingent on future employment, they were being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the respective service periods. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we and the former shareholders agreed that the former shareholders would terminate their employment. We agreed to pay the majority of the contingent consideration in accordance with the original payment terms. As a result, we accelerated the unearned compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and recorded compensation expense of $5.6 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $0.3 million in fiscal 2011.

Fiscal Year Ended September 28, 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 29, 2012  

Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Diagnostics product sales increased 63% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probes product sales (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012), which contributed $483.1 million of additional revenue in fiscal 2013, partially offset by lower ThinPrep revenues of $28.5 million and fiscal 2013 had one less week than fiscal 2012, which was a 53-week fiscal period. The decline in ThinPrep revenue was primarily due to lower domestic volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower average selling prices internationally. We attribute the domestic volume decline to an increase in testing intervals as a result of recent screening recommendations from governmental agencies and professional organizations. We also experienced lower average selling prices in China, at least in part, due to restructuring the sales channel as we move toward using a combination of dealers and our direct sales force to gain broader market coverage compared to principally a direct sales strategy in fiscal 2012. However, international ThinPrep unit volumes were higher in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. We also experienced a decrease in our Rapid Fetal Fibornecton test revenue of $5.8 million compared to the prior year primarily due to lower domestic volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenues of $5.6 million primarily from our sale of Cervista HPV products primarily in the United States, as we continue to gain new customer accounts and increase unit sales to existing customers. The inclusion of Gen-Probes results is partially impacted by the Novartis collaboration. Pursuant to the collaboration, a portion of Gen-Probes revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by Novartis. As a result, amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by Novartis customers as of the date of our acquisition of Gen-Probe were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 this contingent revenue of $23.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, was not recognized in our results of operations. We expect to experience modest price erosion in our molecular diagnostics products in fiscal 2014.  

Breast Health product sales increased 1% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Our digital mammography systems revenue increased $23.0 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the increase in our 3D Dimensions systems revenue of $52.5 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 as we sold more 3D Dimensions units with higher average selling prices in the United States, partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices internationally. Partially offsetting the increase in 3D Dimensions sales in fiscal 2013, we had lower unit sales and, to a lesser extent, lower average selling prices of our 2D Dimensions systems and Selenia systems on a worldwide basis. We also experienced a decline in sales of related components and workstation products of $7.0 million in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year primarily because customers that upgrade to 3D Dimensions do not always require new versions of these related products. Our breast biopsy products revenue increased $7.8 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in the number of Eviva biopsy devices sold in the United States and, to a lesser extent, internationally, and an increase in the number of Celero devices sold in the United States. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in the unit sales and average selling price of our ATEC devices, which we attribute to the introduction and increased sales of our Eviva biopsy devices. Additionally, in fiscal 2013, we experienced an $8.0 million  

64  

Table of Contents 

 decline in revenue from our organic photoconductor materials business as this non-core product line continues to experience pricing pressures in a competitive market space. We decided to phase out this product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and we expect the phase out process to be completed in fiscal 2014.  

GYN Surgical product sales decreased 2% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the decline in sales of NovaSure devices of $24.0 million and an $11.3 million decrease due to the discontinuance of Adiana system sales. In addition, fiscal 2013 had one less week than fiscal 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in MyoSure system sales, including our new Aquilex fluid management system used with our MyoSure devices, of $29.5 million. We experienced a decrease in the number of NovaSure devices sold in the United States, which we primarily attribute to the continuing effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty and the trend toward higher insurance co-payments and deductibles, resulting in cost-conscious patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives. Partially offsetting this decrease, we sold more units internationally in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. The discontinuance of Adiana system sales was due to our decision to cease manufacturing, marketing and selling the product as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, determining it was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future. The increase in MyoSure system revenue in fiscal 2013 was substantially due to an increase in units sold domestically offset slightly by lower average selling prices due to the introduction of new variations of the primary MyoSure device compared to fiscal 2012.  

Skeletal Health product sales decreased 5% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a decline of $5.2 million in our osteoporosis assessment system sales worldwide and lower average selling prices internationally, partially offset by an increase in mini C-arm sales of $1.6 million, primarily due to the introduction of our new Insight FD product.  

In fiscal 2013, 74% of product sales were generated in the United States, 14% in Europe, 9% in Asia-Pacific, and 3% in other international markets. In fiscal 2012, 73% of product sales were generated in the United States, 12% in Europe, 9% in Asia-Pacific, and 6% in other international markets.  

The increase in product sales in the United States as a percent of consolidated product sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe and to a lesser extent higher sales of our 3D Dimensions systems. The increase in European product sales as a percent of consolidated product sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe product sales in Europe and, to a lesser extent, a higher percentage of Selenia system unit sales to total sales in that region.  

Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. Service and other revenues increased 14% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily in our Breast Health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in the installed base of our digital mammography systems. In addition, the inclusion of Gen-Probe contributed an additional $24.4 million, primarily comprised of other revenue, in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Partially offsetting these increases was one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.

Table of Contents 

Cost of Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Product sales gross margin decreased to 46% in fiscal 2013 compared to 51% in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization expense and charges for additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting.  

Cost of Product Sales. The cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was 39% in fiscal 2013 compared to 37% in fiscal 2012. Cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in the current fiscal year increased moderately in Diagnostics and slightly in Breast Health and decreased in GYN Surgical and to a lesser extent in Skeletal Health compared to the prior year, resulting in an overall increased rate in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.  

Diagnostics gross margin rate declined in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which included $52.4 million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting in fiscal 2013 compared to $19.9 million of such costs in fiscal 2012. We also recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to write down certain instruments and related inventory due to our plan to transition certain customers to our Panther instrumentation from our HTA instrument. In addition, Gen-Probes gross margin since acquisition has been lower than its historical gross margin rate primarily due to the purchase accounting effect on our collaboration agreement with Novartis in our blood screening business. Based on the Novartis collaboration terms, a portion of Gen-Probes revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by Novartis, however, Gen-Probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment. As a result, amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by Novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations. This contingent revenue not recognized in our results of operations was $23.5 million and $11.6 million in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Also contributing to the decline in the Diagnostics gross margin rate was a decline in domestic ThinPrep sales and lower average selling prices in China and other international markets, unfavorable manufacturing and overhead variances, higher service costs, depreciation of equipment at customer sites, and distribution costs.  

Breast Health experienced a slight decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the lower gross margin rate in our breast biopsy business from higher sales of our Eviva disposable, which carries lower gross margins due to higher manufacturing costs and royalty costs compared to our ATEC disposable, and lower average selling prices of our ATEC disposables domestically. We also experienced unfavorable absorption and higher production spend for this line of business primarily due to the transfer of our manufacturing lines from Indianapolis to Costa Rica, resulting in production of some of our breast biopsy products at two facilities. Once the transfer is complete, which is expected in fiscal 2014, these devices will be produced solely in Costa Rica. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in unit sales and average selling prices of our 3D Dimensions systems in the United States coupled with a decrease in our 2D digital systems sales as a percentage of total unit sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. This 2D digital systems decrease was primarily related to our Selenia system and, to a lesser extent, our 2D Dimensions systems. Selenia systems have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our Dimensions systems.  

66  

Table of Contents 

The GYN Surgical gross margin rate in fiscal 2013 increased compared to fiscal 2012 due to favorable manufacturing absorption and the discontinuance of the Adiana system in fiscal 2012, offset by the impact of lower NovaSure system sales. The Adiana system had a much lower gross margin rate compared to the NovaSure and MyoSure systems. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined the Adiana product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future. As a result, we ceased manufacturing, marketing and selling our Adiana system and recorded a charge of $19.1 million in fiscal 2012 for the write-off of inventory, manufacturing equipment and equipment at customer sites, and contractual purchase orders for which there was no expected future use of the materials and components. In addition, the improved gross margin in fiscal 2013 is partially due to the increase in MyoSure system sales and the transfer of its production to Costa Rica, which has resulted in overall lower production costs.  

Skeletal Health had a slightly higher gross margin rate in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to favorable product mix.  

Cost of Product SalesAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8.5 and 20 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which accounted for $112.6 million of additional expense, partially offset by fiscal 2013 having one less week compared to fiscal 2012.  

Cost of Product SalesImpairment of Intangible Assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we determined that a developed technology asset was impaired, primarily due to our decision to cease selling and providing support for such product. As a result, we recorded a charge of $1.7 million to record the asset at its fair value.  

Cost of Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues gross margin was 48% in fiscal 2013 compared to 45% in fiscal 2012. Within our Breast Health segment, the continued conversion of a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period without a corresponding increase in costs to service such contracts has resulted in higher gross margins, partially offset by increased warranty, higher spare parts and additional headcount costs.

Operating Expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 51% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to $76.0 million of additional expense from the inclusion of Gen-Probe. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in compensation and benefits from lower headcount and bonus expense in the legacy Hologic businesses. In addition, expenses were lower in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in prototype materials and consulting expense based on the status and timing of various projects and the discontinuance of Adiana development projects in fiscal 2012. Research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.  

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 6% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to $39.0 million of additional expense from the inclusion of Gen-Probe, higher compensation for additional sales personnel worldwide, and integration costs related to the Gen-Probe acquisition. In fiscal 2013, we also had higher marketing spend for our initiatives related to our 3D Dimensions tomosynthesis products and MyoSure system, and higher training and traveling expenses for our increased sales personnel headcount. Partially offsetting these increases in fiscal 2013 was the absence of expenditures for our NovaSure direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, which was completed in fiscal 2012, the discontinuance of the Adiana system in fiscal 2012, decreased expenditures for international trade shows, meetings and medical education and a reduction of headcount in the second half of fiscal 2013. In addition, there was one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.  

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 3% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to $41.4 million of additional expense from the inclusion of Gen-Probe, integration costs related to the Gen-Probe acquisition, the medical device excise tax of $15.7 million, higher compensation and benefits, and an increase in information technology service contracts from an increase of licenses, partially offset by lower acquisition transaction costs to third-parties and lower consulting costs as well as a reduction in headcount in the second half of fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, these increases were partially offset by legal settlement benefit of $8.9 million, lower bad debt expense due to a writeoff of an international account in the prior year, and lower charges for sales and other non-income tax audits as compared to fiscal 2012. In addition, there was one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.

Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, business licenses and non-compete agreements related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. The increase in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which accounted for $45.0 million of additional expense, partially offset by one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.  

Contingent ConsiderationCompensation Expense. In connection with certain of our recent acquisitions, we are obligated to make contingent earn-out payments. Amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment. These payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones, typically incremental revenue growth, as was the case for our TCT acquisition. The amounts recorded in fiscal 2013 relate solely to TCT, and in fiscal 2012, primarily relate to TCT. The measurement period for the TCT earn-out was completed in fiscal 2013.  

Contingent ConsiderationFair Value Adjustments. In connection with our acquisitions of Sentinelle Medical and Interlace, we were required to pay future consideration that was contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones. As of each respective acquisition date, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business. This liability was not contingent on future employment and was based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes. At each reporting period, we re-measured the fair value of these liabilities and recorded the changes in fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted from accretion of the liability for the passage of time, changes in discount rates, and changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates. The Sentinelle Medical final measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and as a result the charges recorded in fiscal 2013 relate solely to Interlace. We recorded a charge of $11.3 million in fiscal 2013 reflecting an increase in the fair value of the liability due to higher revenues for Interlace than estimated. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a charge of $38.5 million related to an increase in estimated Interlace revenues resulting in a charge of $41.8 million offset by a benefit of the Sentinelle Medical liability of $3.4 million due to a reduction in estimated revenues. The measurement period for the Interlace earn-out was completed in fiscal 2013.  

Impairment of Goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as a result of our company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure, we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit. The Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our Aptima business acquired in the Gen-Probe acquisition and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the Third Wave acquisition. The updated forecast, which reflects recent pricing pressures, is now lower, and the current projections for revenue and profitability are lower than those expected at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. As such, the fair value of this reporting unit declined. As a result of performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the completion of a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of the implied goodwill, we recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. No other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal 2013.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million related to our MammoSite reporting unit, which is included in our Breast Health segment. The fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal 2011 primarily due to our reassessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and long-term growth projections. No other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal 2012. For additional information, refer to Note 2 Intangible Assets and Goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Gain on Sale of Intellectual Property. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded a net gain of $53.9 million related to the sale of our Makena assets to K-V Pharmaceutical Company, or KV. On August 4, 2012,  

69  

Table of Contents 

 KV and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. We had been pursuing our claims against KV in these proceedings for amounts due under our agreement with KV, and in December 2012, we and KV executed a settlement agreement, which became effective on December 28, 2012. Under the settlement agreement, we released KV from all claims in consideration of a $60.0 million payment. We recorded this amount net of certain costs, including contingent fees and amounts due to the inventor. We will receive no more payments from KV. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we received a scheduled payment of $12.5 million from KV, which was recorded net of amounts owed to the original inventor of Makena. For additional information, please refer to Note 7 contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we acquired certain research and development assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a $4.5 million charge within our GYN Surgical segment.  

Restructuring and Divestiture Charges. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Gen-Probe, we implemented a restructuring action to consolidate our Diagnostics operations by decreasing headcount and transferring our legacy molecular diagnostics operations in Madison, Wisconsin to San Diego, California. We also finalized our decision to transfer production of our interventional breast products from our Indianapolis facility to our Costa Rica facility. In addition, we transfered our Selenium panel coating production line from Germany to Newark, Delaware. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, we implemented additional restructuring actions to reduce expenses which included terminating employees. Pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the majority of severance and benefit charges are being recognized ratably over the respective required employee service periods, and in certain circumstances we are recording charges pursuant to contractual or statutory requirements. Other charges, such as facility closure costs are being recognized as incurred. In fiscal 2013 and 2012, we recorded restructuring charges of $32.8 million and $17.5 million, respectively, which were primarily comprised of severance and related benefits, including stock compensation for acceleration of equity awards. For additional information, please refer to Note 4 contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Interest Income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower rates on funds invested in sweep accounts.  

Interest Expense.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs on our convertible notes, amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement, and Senior Notes. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to debt borrowed under the Credit Agreement and sale of Senior Notes in connection with our Gen-Probe acquisition in

 the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, we incurred additional expenses of $4.1 million related to our retirement, pursuant to separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements, of $370.0 million in aggregate principal of our 2.00% Convertible Notes due 2037, or the 2007 Notes, for $370.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Notes due 2043, or the 2013 Notes. This exchange enabled us to extend the first put date to December 15, 2017 as well as the subsequent put dates, as disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, with the conversion price of the notes remaining at approximately $38.59. The 2013 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the original principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year, ending on December 15, 2013 and accrete principal, which we will accrue as an additional interest expense, from their date of issuance at a rate of 4.00% per year until and including December 15, 2017, and 2.00% per year thereafter. Since the exchange was a modification for accounting purposes, the issuance costs were expensed and not capitalized. In addition, in fiscal 2013, we incurred additional expenses of $2.4 million and $1.1 million related to our refinancing of the Term Loan A tranche and Term Loan B tranche under the Credit Agreement, respectively, which lowered the interest rates on these facilities by 100 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively. The majority of the refinancings was accounted for as a modification for accounting purposes and the pro-rata amount of issuance costs were expensed and not capitalized. Partially offsetting this increase was lower amortization of our convertible notes debt discount.  

Debt Extinguishment Loss.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we refinanced the Term Loan A tranche of the Credit Agreement and certain existing creditors opted not to participate in such refinancing. As a result, the pro-rata share of the original debt discount and issuance costs related to these creditors aggregating $3.2 million was recorded as a debt extinguishment loss.  

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we refinanced the Term Loan B tranche of the Credit Agreement and made a voluntary prepayment of $200.0 million of principal. As a result, the pro-rata share of the original debt discount and issuance costs related to the total principal paydown of $6.0 million was recorded as a debt extinguishment loss.  

In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, pursuant to separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements, we retired $500.0 million in aggregate principal of our 2007 Notes for $500.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Notes due 2042, or the 2012 Notes. This exchange enabled us to extend the first put date to March 1, 2018 as well as the subsequent put dates as disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In consideration, the equity conversion price of the notes was reduced to approximately $31.18 from $38.59, and the cash coupon payment period was extended four and a quarter more years, consistent with extending the first put date, instead of accreting the coupon to the principal as required under the original terms. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $42.3 million, which includes the write-off of the pro-rata allocation of deferred financing costs.  

Other Income (Expense), net.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

In fiscal 2013, this account was primarily comprised of gains on our investments for our deferred compensation plan, including the cash surrender of life insurance contracts, of $4.7 million, a $2.0 million gain on the sale of a cost-method investment, $1.3 million from insurance and investment recoveries, and net foreign currency exchange gains of $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these gains were other-than-temporary impairment charges for cost-method investments of $6.4 million.  

In fiscal 2012, this account was primarily comprised of gains on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan of $3.2 million, net foreign currency transaction gains of $0.8 million, and other miscellaneous gains.  

(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 1.7% of the pretax loss compared to 19.4% of the pretax loss in fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2013, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, non-deductible contingent consideration expense related to the TCT and Interlace acquisitions and unbenefited foreign losses, partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and the release of a $19.9 million valuation allowance related to capital losses utilized to offset capital gains generated during the year.  

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was significantly impacted by non-deductible contingent consideration compensation expense related to the TCT, Interlace and Sentinelle Medical acquisitions, nondeductible acquisition costs, a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, and a net increase in income tax reserves and valuation allowances on certain foreign losses. The unfavorable tax impact of these items was partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and a loss claimed related to the discontinuance of the Adiana product line. The effect of these permanent items to the effective tax rate was magnified by the fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss.  

Segment Results of Operations  

We report our business as four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss. Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.  

Diagnostics.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

72  

Table of Contents 

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above, which is principally attributable to the inclusion of Gen-Probe for a full year.  

Operating loss for this business segment increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $1.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to our Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit discussed above.  

While gross margin in absolute dollars increased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the inclusion of Gen-Probe as discussed above, higher operating expenses, excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, more than offset the gross margin impact. The gross margin rate decreased to 41.4% in fiscal 2013 compared to 50.5% in fiscal 2012, which is primarily attributable to the inclusion of Gen-Probe for the full year and incremental charges related to developed technology intangible asset amortization expense of $112.6 million and inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting of $32.5 million. In addition, we recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter to write down certain instruments and related inventory due to our plan to transition certain customers to our Panther instrumentation from our HTA instrumentation. Gross margin was also impacted by lower ThinPrep volumes in the U.S. and lower average selling prices in China and other international markets, unfavorable manufacturing and overhead variances, higher service costs, depreciation of equipment at customer sites, and distribution costs.  

Operating expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge noted above, increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which contributed an incremental $197.9 million of expenses comprised of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and amortization expense. In addition, this segment incurred incremental charges and expenses for restructuring of $4.0 million, TCT contingent consideration expense of $4.6 million, medical device excise taxes of $6.8 million and integration and retention costs. Partially offsetting these increases were reductions in headcount, bonus expenses, international trade shows and marketing initiatives and project spend in the legacy Hologic businesses. In addition, in fiscal 2013, we recorded a net gain of $53.9 million related to the settlement with KV for the sale of our rights to Makena discussed above, and in the prior year second quarter, we recorded a net gain of $12.4 million related to the Makena sale.  

Breast Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the $25.5 million increase in service revenue and the $3.8 million in product revenues discussed above.  

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in gross margin dollars from higher revenues discussed above and lower operating expenses.  

In fiscal 2013, the overall gross margin rate increased to 50.2% compared to 49.4% in the prior year. The product gross margin rate decreased slightly to 49.3% in fiscal 2013 compared to 49.9% in fiscal 2012 as discussed above. Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a gain on the settlement of class-action litigation of $5.7 million, lower clinical trials spend, lower compensation from  

73  

Table of Contents 

 headcount reductions, and lower corporate allocations due to the Gen-Probe acquisition. Partially offsetting these decreases were incremental restructuring charges of $7.1 million, and the medical device excise tax of $5.3 million.  

GYN Surgical.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GYN Surgical revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the decrease in product sales discussed above.  

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, gross margin in absolute dollars increased compared to fiscal 2012 primarily because fiscal 2012 included $19.1 million of charges recorded in cost of product sales related to the discontinuance of the Adiana system discussed above. The gross margin rate improved to 56.9% from 50.3% in fiscal 2012. Gross margin also improved primarily due to higher sales of our MyoSure system, which was partially offset by a reduction in NovaSure system sales and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $2.9 million.  

Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due a reduction in Interlace contingent consideration charges of $30.5 million, a reduction in advertising expenditures for our NovaSure systems direct-to-consumer advertising campaign which ended in fiscal 2012, lower legal expenses primarily relating to a lawsuit settlement in fiscal 2012, lower marketing, medical education and research and development expenses due to the discontinuance of the Adiana product line, and lower compensation due to headcount reductions. In addition, in fiscal 2012, we recorded charges for an ongoing sales tax audit. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher spend on developing the next generation NovaSure device, marketing initiatives for the MyoSure system and the medical device excise tax of $2.7 million.  

Skeletal Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Skeletal Health revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the decrease in product sales of $3.5 million discussed above and reduction in service revenues of $2.0 million. Operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily driven by restructuring charges of $3.8 million and the medical device excise tax of $0.9 million.

Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2012, Breast Health product revenues increased 4% compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in our breast biopsy products revenue of $18.5 million as a result of an increase in the number of Eviva and Celero biopsy devices sold in the United States. In addition, our digital mammography systems revenue increased $1.4 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily attributable to an increase in the number of units sold of both of our 2D and 3D Dimensions products worldwide, partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices internationally in fiscal 2012. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues from the Dimensions systems was a decrease in the number of Selenia systems sold worldwide and, to a lesser extent, a slight deterioration of average selling prices, and a continued shift in Selenia product mix and configuration differences. We sold more Selenia Performance models, which have fewer features than our base Selenia model, which is a full-featured model, and carry lower average selling prices. In addition, we sold more Selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total Selenia systems, and average selling prices were lower in our international markets compared to the domestic market. We also had an additional $5.0 million in revenue in fiscal 2012 from our new Trident product.  

Diagnostics product sales increased 25% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which contributed $86.7 million in revenue, and an increase of $29.7 million in ThinPrep pap tests revenue. The ThinPrep increase was principally from an increase in the sales price of ThinPrep in China as well as higher volumes from the inclusion of revenues of TCT (our former distributor in that country acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011) and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the number of ThinPrep pap tests sold in other international markets, partially offset by a decline in domestic units sold. The inclusion of Gen-Probes results is partially impacted by the Novartis collaboration. Pursuant to the collaboration, a portion of Gen-Probes revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by Novartis, however, Gen-Probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment. As a result, amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by Novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations. In fiscal 2012, this contingent revenue of $11.6 million was not recognized in our results of operations. We also experienced growth in our legacy molecular diagnostics products, which contributed a revenue increase of $13.5 million in fiscal 2012 as we continued to gain new customer accounts and unit sales to existing customers and increase our international sales through TCT. In addition, in fiscal 2012, we sold more diagnostics instruments internationally, increasing revenue by $4.8 million. Revenues also increased slightly due to the extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year compared to fiscal 2011, which was a 52-week year.  

GYN surgical product sales increased 4% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of the MyoSure system, which contributed an increase of $29.7 million of revenue in fiscal 2012, partially offset by a decrease in NovaSure devices revenue of $9.0 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, revenues also increased slightly due to the extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. While we experienced an  

75  

Table of Contents 

 increase in the number of NovaSure devices sold internationally, these increases were more than offset by a decline in the number of NovaSure devices sold domestically, and lower average selling prices driven by product mix and more international sales. We believe the decline in the number of NovaSure devices sold in the United States is primarily attributable to the continued effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty, which has resulted in patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives. In addition, Adiana system revenues declined $10.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The reduction in Adiana system revenues was due to our decision to cease manufacturing, marketing and selling the product as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, determining it was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future.  

Skeletal Health product sales increased 5% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million of our mini C-arm systems as a result of our new Insight system introduced in 2012, and an increase of $1.0 million in osteoporosis assessment product sales internationally.  

In fiscal 2012, 73% of product sales were generated in the United States, 12% in Europe, 9% in Asia-Pacific, and 6% in other international markets. In fiscal 2011, 76% of product sales were generated in the United States, 13% in Europe, 6% in Asia-Pacific, and 5% in other international markets.  

Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. Service and other revenues increased 11% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily in our Breast Health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our digital mammography systems, which were no longer under warranty, and an extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.  

Cost of Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Product sales gross margin decreased to 51% in fiscal 2012 compared to 53% in fiscal 2011 as discussed below.  

Cost of Product Sales. The cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was 37% in fiscal 2012 compared to 35% in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012 cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased in GYN Surgical and Diagnostics, declined slightly in Breast Health and remained relatively flat in Skeletal Health compared to fiscal 2011, resulting in an overall lower gross margin rate in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.

Table of Contents 

The GYN Surgical gross margin rate in fiscal 2012 declined primarily due to charges of $19.1 million related to our decision to shut down our Adiana product line. On April 30, 2012, we announced that we were ceasing to manufacture, market and sell the Adiana system, determining that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future. The charge related to the write-off of inventory, manufacturing equipment and equipment at customer sites, and contractual purchase orders for which there was no expected future use of the materials and components. In addition, lower sales of the NovaSure system resulted in a lower gross margin rate, which was partially offset by the shift of sales to our MyoSure system compared to lower margin Adiana system sales. For additional information pertaining to the Adiana product line discontinuance charges, please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

The Diagnostics gross margin rate in fiscal 2012 declined compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe results, which included $19.9 million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting, higher service costs and depreciation of equipment at customer sites, and distribution costs. Gen-Probes gross margin since acquisition was lower than its historical gross margin rate due to the purchase accounting effect on our collaboration agreement with Novartis in our blood screening business. Based on the Novartis collaboration terms, a portion of Gen-Probes revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by Novartis, however, Gen-Probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment. As a result, amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by Novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations. In fiscal 2012, this contingent revenue of $11.6 million was not recognized in our results of operations. Partially offsetting these cost increases were higher ThinPrep pap test volumes resulting in lower fixed overhead costs per unit, favorable manufacturing variances, and the increase in sales price in China attributable to our acquisition of TCT.  

In fiscal 2012, Breast Healths gross margin rate increased slightly compared to fiscal 2011. The gross margin rate for our digital mammography systems increased due to higher sales of our 3D Dimensions systems, which have higher average selling prices and gross margins than our Selenia systems, and an increase in 3D tomosynthesis software upgrades. Partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in Selenia Performance systems sales as a percent of total Selenia system sales compared to the prior year. Our Selenia Performance systems have lower gross margins than our full-featured Selenia systems. We also sold more Selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total Selenia systems where average selling prices are lower compared to the domestic market. Also offsetting the overall increase in Breast Healths gross margin was the sales mix within our breast biopsy products as we sold more Eviva disposables and less ATEC disposables as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year. Eviva disposables have a lower gross margin than our ATEC disposables because they have a higher manufacturing cost and carry additional royalty charges.  

Cost of Product SalesAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology and patents. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8.5 and 20 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the inclusion of technology assets acquired in our Gen-Probe acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and from our Interlace acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. In addition, there was an increase in amortization expense due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets, primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Amortization was also higher due to the extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.

Cost of Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues gross margin was 45% in fiscal 2012 compared to 46% in fiscal 2011. Gross margin decreased due to additional expenses incurred related to international expansion, which has resulted in the hiring of additional service personnel, increasing compensation and travel costs worldwide. In addition, service costs increased in our Diagnostics segment due to an increase in our installed base of ThinPrep processors and imagers.  

Operating Expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which accounted for $17.1 million of additional expenses. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in compensation and benefits due to lower bonus expenses, and a reduction in clinical trials and regulatory costs, which was primarily a result of the status and timing of projects. Research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials.  

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. These increases were primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of Gen-Probe, which accounted for $8.4 million of additional expense, and the inclusion of TCT for a full year, an increase in the number of sales personnel in the GYN Surgical business segment, an increase in compensation and benefits and higher commissions, continuing product launch activities related to our 3D Dimensions product, and higher travel expenses. These expenses were also higher due to the extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in fiscal 2012 was partially offset by lower expenditures for our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign for NovaSure.  

78  

Table of Contents 

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 38% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher acquisition related transaction costs associated with the Gen-Probe acquisition of $34.3 million, additional expenses, including retention costs, from the inclusion of Gen-Probe of $12.8 million, integration and consulting costs related to the Gen-Probe acquisition, an increase in bad debt expense internationally, charges for an ongoing state sales tax audit, an increase in our deferred compensation plan, or DCP, liability, which is driven by the underlying market changes of hypothetical investments, and higher invoice collection fees from higher credit card payments. These expenses were also higher due to the extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by an overall decrease in compensation and benefits due to lower bonus expense and lower stock compensation expense as higher valued restricted stock units fully vested in fiscal 2011 and lower depreciation expense.  

Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, business licenses and non-compete agreements related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. The increase in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets from the Gen-Probe acquisition, a full year of amortization from the Interlace and TCT acquisitions, and an increase in amortization due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets, primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc merger in fiscal 2008. Amortization was also higher due to the extra week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.  

Contingent ConsiderationCompensation Expense. In connection with our recent acquisitions, excluding Gen-Probe, we are obligated to make contingent earn-out payments. Amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment. These payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones, typically incremental revenue growth, as is the case for TCT. The amounts recorded in fiscal 2012 relate to TCT and, to a lesser extent, Healthcome. Amounts recorded in fiscal 2011 primarily relate to TCT and Interlace. We recorded charges of $81.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. For additional information, refer to the prior section titled Acquisitions and to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Contingent ConsiderationFair Value Adjustments. In connection with our acquisitions of Sentinelle Medical and Interlace, we were required to pay future consideration that is contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones. As of each respective acquisition date, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business. This liability was not contingent on future employment and was based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes. At each reporting period, we re-measured the fair value of these liabilities and recorded the changes in fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities could result from accretion of the liability for the passage of time, changes in discount rates, and changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a net charge of $38.5 million reflecting an increase in the fair value of the Interlace liability of $41.8 million due to higher revenue estimates, partially offset by a benefit of $3.4 million related to Sentinelle Medical due to actual revenues being less than those estimated. We recorded a net benefit of $8.0 million in fiscal 2011 reflecting a net decrease in the fair values of these liabilities comprised of a reduction in the fair value of the Sentinelle Medical liability of $14.3 million due primarily to changes in revenue assumptions offset by a charge of $6.3 million related to Interlace based primarily on the accretion of the liability to the expected payment amount. For additional information, refer to the prior section titled Acquisitions and to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Impairment of Goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million related to our MammoSite reporting unit, which is included in our Breast Health segment. The fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal 2011 primarily due to our reassessment in the fourth quarter of  

79  

Table of Contents 

 fiscal 2012 of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and long-term growth projections. No other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal 2012. For additional information, refer to Note 2Intangible Assets and Goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Gain on Sale of Intellectual Property. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we received a scheduled payment of $12.5 million from KV pursuant to our amended agreement, which was recorded net of amounts owed to the original inventor of Makena. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we received FDA approval of Makena, and all rights to Makena were transferred to KV. Upon transfer, we received $12.5 million, and including the $79.5 million received in prior periods, we recorded a gain on the sale of intellectual property, net of the write-off of certain assets, of $84.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. For additional information on this arrangement and amounts we may receive in the future, refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we acquired certain research and development assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a $4.5 million charge within our GYN Surgical segment.  

Restructuring and Divestiture Charges. In fiscal 2012, we recorded aggregate restructuring and divestiture charges of $36.6 million of which $17.5 million was recorded in this line item, and $19.1 million was recorded in cost of product sales. These charges are related to a number of actions in fiscal 2012 as described below. For additional information pertaining to restructuring and divesture charges, please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Abandonment of Adiana Product Line  

At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we decided to cease manufacturing, marketing and selling our Adiana system, which was a product line within our GYN Surgical reporting segment. We determined that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future. In addition, we settled the intellectual property litigation regarding the Adiana system with Conceptus as discussed below under Contingent Earn-Out Payments. As a result, in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a charge of $18.3 million and recorded additional adjustments in fiscal 2012 resulting in an aggregate charge of $19.5 million. Of the total charge, $19.1 million was recorded within cost of product sales and $0.4 million was recorded in restructuring. The amount recorded in cost of product sales comprised of impairment charges of $9.9 million to record inventory at its net realizable value, $6.5 million to write down certain manufacturing equipment and equipment placed at customer sites to its fair value that had no further utility, and $2.7 million for outstanding contractual purchase orders of raw materials and components that will not be utilized and other contractual obligations. In connection with this action, we terminated certain manufacturing and other personnel primarily at our Costa Rica location, resulting in severance charges of $0.1 million, and incurred other contractual charges of $0.3 million. All identified employees were terminated and paid as of September 29, 2012.  

Consolidation of Diagnostics Operations  

In connection with our acquisition of Gen-Probe, we implemented restructuring actions to consolidate our Diagnostics operations, such as streamlining product development initiatives, reducing overlapping functional areas such as sales, marketing and general and administrative functions, and consolidation of manufacturing resources, field services and support. As a result, we terminated certain employees from Gen-Probe and our legacy diagnostics business in research and development, sales, marketing and general and administrative functions. We recorded severance and benefit charges of $13.3 million related to this action pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. The majority of these employees ceased working in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and their full severance charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, certain of the terminated Gen-Probe employees had unvested stock options and their vesting terms were accelerated as a result of termination. As such, the severance charges include $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.

Table of Contents 

In addition, we are moving our legacy molecular diagnostics operations from Madison, Wisconsin to San Diego, California. This transfer is expected to be finalized by the end of calendar 2014 and the majority of employees in Madison will be terminated in fiscal 2013 and 2014. We are recording severance and benefit charges pursuant to ASC 420 and estimate the total severance and benefits charge to be approximately $6.4 million, which will be recorded ratably over the estimated service period of the affected employees. We recorded $1.5 million in fiscal 2012 related to this action, which was comprised of $0.9 million for severance benefits and a $0.6 million non-cash charge as a result of exiting certain research projects. Additional charges will be recorded as the manufacturing operation is transferred and the facility is closed down. These charges will be recorded as they are incurred.  

Closure of Indianapolis Facility  

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we finalized our decision to transfer production of our interventional breast products from our Indianapolis facility to our facility in Costa Rica. The transfer is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2014 and all employees at that location will be terminated. We are recording severance and benefit charges pursuant to ASC 420 and estimate the total severance and benefits charge to be approximately $7.0 million, which will be recorded ratably over the estimated service period of the affected employees. We recorded $1.8 million in fiscal 2012 related to this action comprised of $0.9 million of severance benefits and $0.9 million for amounts owed to the state of Indiana for employment credits. Additional charges will be recorded as the manufacturing operation is transferred and the facility is closed down. These charges will be recorded as they are incurred.  

Interest Income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest income increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a higher average cash balance in fiscal 2012, prior to the Gen-Probe acquisition.  

Interest Expense.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2012, interest expense increased due to the financing to fund the Gen-Probe acquisition on August 1, 2012. We borrowed an aggregate of $3.5 billion in principal comprised of term loans and Senior Notes. Interest expense also includes the interest costs and amortization of the debt discount of our convertible notes and amortization of deferred financing costs.  

Debt Extinguishment Loss.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

81  

Table of Contents 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, pursuant to separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements, we retired $500.0 million in aggregate principal of our 2007 Notes for $500.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2012 Notes. This exchange enabled us to extend the first put date out approximately four and a quarter years to March 1, 2018 as well as the subsequent put dates. In consideration, the equity conversion price of the notes was reduced to approximately $31.18 from $38.59, and the cash coupon payment period was extended four and a quarter more years, consistent with extending the first put date, instead of accreting the coupon to the principal as required under the original terms. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $42.3 million, which includes the write-off of the pro-rata allocation of deferred financing costs.  

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, pursuant to separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements, we retired $450.0 million in aggregate principal of our 2007 Notes for $450.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037, or the 2010 Notes. This exchange enabled us to extend the first put date out three years to December 15, 2016 from December 13, 2013 as well as the subsequent put dates. In consideration, the equity conversion price of the notes was reduced to approximately $23.03 from $38.59, and the cash coupon payment period was extended for three more years, consistent with extending the first put date, instead of accreting the coupon to the principal as required under the original terms. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $29.9 million, which includes the write-off of the pro-rata allocation of deferred financing costs. For additional information, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Other Income (Expense), net.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2012, this account was primarily comprised of gains on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our DCP of $3.2 million, net foreign currency transaction gains of $0.8 million, and other miscellaneous gains.  

In fiscal 2011, this account was primarily comprised of impairment charges of $2.4 million for cost-method investments, net foreign currency transaction losses of $1.1 million and a loss on cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our DCP of $0.8 million.  

Provision for Income Taxes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 19.4% of pre-tax losses compared to 30.9% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was significantly impacted by non-deductible contingent consideration compensation expense, non-deductible acquisition costs, a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, and a net increase in income tax reserves and valuation allowances on certain foreign losses. The unfavorable tax impact of these items was partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and a loss claimed related to the discontinuance of the Adiana product line. The effect of these permanent items to the effective tax rate was magnified by the fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was  

82  

Table of Contents 

 less than the statutory rate primarily due to reversing income tax reserves, the domestic production activities deduction benefit and U.S. and Canadian research and development tax credits. The $9.1 million income tax reserve reversal was due to a favorable settlement of our U.S. federal income tax audit for fiscal years 2007 through 2009 and statutes of limitations expiring in several state and foreign jurisdictions.  

Segment Results of Operations  

Breast Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the increase in product revenue of $22.4 million discussed above and a $27.8 million increase in service revenues.  

Operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by an increase in gross margin on an absolute dollar basis as a result of increased revenues discussed above.  

In fiscal 2012, the overall gross margin rate increased to 49.4% from 49.0% in fiscal 2011 due primarily to improvements in product gross margin discussed above. The product gross margin rate increased to 49.9% in fiscal 2012 compared to 48.7% in fiscal 2011. Operating expenses were higher in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the net benefit of $14.3 million recorded in the prior year compared to the $3.4 million benefit in fiscal 2012 to adjust the Sentinelle Medical contingent consideration liability to fair value, higher contingent compensation expense of $5.6 million related to Healthcome in fiscal 2012, the Mammosite goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 million, and restructuring charges of $2.3 million primarily related to our decision to close our facility in Indianapolis. In addition, expenses were higher in fiscal 2012 due to higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel, continuing product launch activities related to our 3D Dimensions product, medical education, travel, and litigation settlements and related expenses, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses.  

Diagnostics.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

83  

Table of Contents 

Operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the net gain of $84.5 million on the sale of Makena intellectual property to KV in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to a net gain of $12.4 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 for a scheduled payment received under the amended agreement. The balance of the decrease in fiscal 2012 of $131.4 million was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase in gross margin in absolute dollars. While gross margin in absolute dollars increased, the gross margin rate declined to 50.5% in fiscal 2012 compared to 53.9% in fiscal 2011 as discussed above. Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of TCT for a full year, which included an increase in contingent consideration compensation expense of $58.0 million, the inclusion of $42.4 million of operating expenses for Gen-Probe (excluding restructuring charges and integration and retention costs), acquisition transaction and integration costs of approximately $42.0 million related to the Gen-Probe transaction, and restructuring charges of $14.8 million related to the consolidation of our Diagnostics business as a result of the Gen-Probe acquisition. We also experienced higher expenses related to trade shows, higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel and annual salary increases, travel, and higher bad debt charges, primarily related to one international customer.  

GYN Surgical.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GYN Surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

This business segment incurred an operating loss in fiscal 2012 compared to income in fiscal 2011 primarily attributable to the inclusion of Interlaces operations (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2011), which included a charge of $41.8 million in fiscal 2012 to adjust the contingent consideration liability to fair value compared to aggregate contingent consideration charges of $8.4 million in fiscal 2011, and the aggregate charge of $19.5 million related to the Adiana product line discontinuance. Overall, gross margin in absolute dollars decreased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the Adiana product line charge recorded in cost of product sales of $19.1 million, and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $9.2 million, partially offset by the impact of higher sales as discussed above. This resulted in the segments gross margin rate declining to 50.3% in fiscal 2012 from 56.8% in fiscal 2011.  

In addition, this segment incurred higher operating expenses in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily in sales and marketing related to higher compensation and benefits for additional sales personnel, annual salary increases and commissions, and higher travel, an in-process research and development charge of $4.5 million, higher intangible asset amortization expenses, additional expenditures for ongoing research and development projects and charges related to an ongoing state sales tax audit. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in advertising expenditures for our NovaSure systems direct-to-consumer advertising campaign and lower marketing and medical education expenses related to the discontinuance of the Adiana product line.

Skeletal Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Skeletal Health revenues increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

Operating income increased slightly in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in revenues and improvement in gross margin rates to 44.1% in fiscal 2012 from 43.5% in fiscal 2011. The improvement in gross margin dollars was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and travel expenses.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

At September 28, 2013, we had $535.7 million of working capital, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $822.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $262.1 million during fiscal 2013 principally due to cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of our LIFECODES business, our settlement with KV, and net proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by principal payments on our term loans, capital expenditures and contingent consideration payments.  

In fiscal 2013, our operating activities provided us with $493.8 million of cash, which included a net loss of $1.17 billion, offset primarily by non-cash charges for a goodwill impairment of $1.1 billion, depreciation and amortization aggregating $516.0 million, non-cash interest expense of $81.2 million related to our outstanding debt, the fair value adjustment related to Gen-Probe acquired inventory sold of $52.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $52.3 million, a $11.3 million fair value adjustment primarily related to the Interlace contingent consideration liability and debt extinguishment losses of $9.2 million from our term loan refinancings. These adjustments to net loss were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $198.0 million, primarily from the amortization of intangible assets, and the net gain on the sale of intellectual property of $53.9 million. Cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of $64.5 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by a decrease in inventory of $25.2 million due to improved inventory management relative to demand, a decrease in prepaid income taxes of $25.1 million due to income tax refunds, and an increase in deferred revenue of $13.3 million due to an increase in service contracts from our higher installed base of digital mammography systems. These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $6.4 million due to the timing of payments.  

In fiscal 2013, our investing activities provided us with $18.8 million primarily due to cash proceeds of $85.1 million from our sale of businesses, which largely consists of proceeds from the LIFECODES sale, and the $60.0 million settlement with KV related to the sale of our rights to our Makena intellectual property. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was the use of cash primarily for purchases of property and equipment of $90.1 million, which consisted primarily of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and manufacturing equipment and computer hardware, the payment of contingent consideration to the former shareholders of Adiana of $16.8 million, the acquisitions of Chindex and SenoRx assets for $6.3 million, the purchase of insurance contracts to fund our deferred compensation plan of $4.0 million, and cost-method equity investments of $3.7 million.  

85  

Table of Contents 

In fiscal 2013, our financing activities used cash of $248.8 million, primarily due to principal payments of $265.0 million under our Credit Agreement, payments of contingent consideration of $43.0 million, primarily comprised of $39.0 million for Interlace and $3.4 million for Sentinelle Medical, $12.3 million for employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units, and the payment of debt issuance costs of $9.4 million related to the exchange of our convertible notes and the Credit Agreement refinancings. Under ASC 805, Business Combinations, the payment of contingent consideration recorded at fair value in purchase accounting as of the acquisition date is treated as a financing activity. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $75.1 million from the exercise of stock options, and the excess tax benefit from equity awards of $7.4 million.  

Debt  

We had total recorded debt outstanding of $4.81 billion at September 28, 2013, which is comprised of amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement of $2.22 billion (principal $2.24 billion), Senior Notes of $1.0 billion and convertible notes of $1.59 billion (principal $1.725 billion). No amounts were outstanding under our Revolving Facility.  

Credit Agreement  

Concurrent with closing the Gen-Probe acquisition on August 1, 2012, we and certain of our domestic subsidiaries, or the Guarantors, entered into a credit and guaranty agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, in its capacity as administrative and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement was amended in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, resulting in a 100 basis point reduction to the interest rate on the Term Loan A facility and the Revolving Facility. On August 2, 2013, the Credit Agreement was further amended resulting in a 75 basis point reduction to the interest rate on the Term Loan B facility.  

The facilities under the Credit Agreement initially consisted of:  

       $1.0 billion senior secured tranche A term loan, or Term Loan A, with a final maturity date of August 1, 2017;  

       $1.5 billion senior secured tranche B term loan, or Term Loan B, with a final maturity date of August 1, 2019; and  

       $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility, or Revolving Facility, with a final maturity date of August 1, 2017.  

As of September 28, 2013, the interest rates under our Term Loan A facility and Term Loan B facility were 2.2% and 3.75%, respectively, and the principal amounts outstanding were $950 million and $1.29 billion, respectively. On October 31, 2013, we voluntarily pre-paid $100.0 million of the Term Loan B facility, reducing the principal amount to $1.19 billion.  

The credit facilities are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of our assets and the assets of the Guarantors, including all of the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. subsidiaries owned by us and the Guarantors, 65% of the capital stock of certain of our first-tier foreign subsidiaries and all intercompany debt.  

We are required to make scheduled principal payments under the Term Loan A facility in increasing amounts ranging from $12.5 million per three month period beginning October 31, 2012 to $50.0 million per three month period commencing October 31, 2015, and under the Term Loan B facility in equal installments of $3.75 million per three month period beginning on October 31, 2012 and for 27 three month periods thereafter. The remaining balance for each term loan is due at maturity. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility are due at maturity. We are required to make principal repayments first, pro rata among the term loan

 facilities, and second to the Revolving Facility from specified excess cash flows from operations and from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales, debt issuances, insurance recoveries and equity offerings. Subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily pre-pay any of the credit facilities without premium or penalty.  

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability and the ability of the Guarantors, subject to negotiated exceptions, to: incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on their assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of their businesses.  

The credit facilities contain total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning with our first quarter of fiscal 2013. The total net leverage ratio is 7.00:1.00 beginning on our fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2012, and it then decreases over time to 4.00:1.00 for the quarter ending September 30, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. The interest coverage ratio is 3.25:1.00 beginning on our fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2012, and it then increases over time to 3.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and each quarter thereafter. The total net leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of our consolidated net debt as of the quarter end to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on the measurement date. The interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the prior four-fiscal quarter period ending on the measurement date to adjusted consolidated cash interest expense for the same measurement period. These terms, and the calculation thereof, are defined in further detail in the Credit Agreement. As of September 28, 2013, we were in compliance with these covenants.  

Senior Notes  

On August 1, 2012, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are our general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors. The Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2020 and bear interest at the rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on February 1, 2013.  

The indenture for our Senior Notes contains customarily applicable affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants restricting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, subject to negotiated exceptions and qualifications, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other distributions; make certain investments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates; and sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies. We are not required to maintain any financial covenants with respect to the Senior Notes.  

We may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before August 1, 2015, at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We also have the option to redeem the Senior Notes on or after: August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016 at 103.125% of par; August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 at 102.083% of par; August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018 at 101.042% of par; and August 1, 2018 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if we undergo a change of control, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holders Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

Convertible Notes  

At September 28, 2013, our convertible notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $1.725 billion, are recorded at $1.59 billion, which is net of the unamortized debt discount attributed to the embedded conversion feature of the convertible notes. These notes consist of:  

       $405 million of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 issued in December 2007 (2007 Notes);  

       $450 million of our 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037 issued in November 2010 (2010 Notes);  

       $500 million of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2042 issued in March 2012 (2012 Notes); and  

       $370 million of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2043 issued in February 2013 (2013 Notes).  

The 2007 Notes, 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes are collectively referred to herein as the convertible notes. The 2013 Notes were issued on February 21, 2013 pursuant to agreements entered into on February 14, 2013 in exchange for an equal principal amount of the 2007 Notes. The 2013 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the original principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year, ending on December 15, 2013 and accrete principal, which we will accrue as an additional interest expense, from their date of issuance at a rate of 4.00% per year until and including December 15, 2017, and 2.00% per year thereafter. All other notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the original principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears until their first put date and thereafter accrete principal at the rate of 2.00% per year. In addition, under certain circumstances contingent interest may be payable under the convertible notes after each of their first put date.  

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2007 Notes on December 13, 2013, and on each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2007 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On November 14, 2013, we announced that we would repurchase, on December 13, 2013, all of the outstanding 2007 Notes at a repurchase price payable in cash equal to 100% of the original principal amount of the 2007 Notes validly surrendered for repurchase and not withdrawn plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, December 13, 2013, at the option of the holders of the 2007 Notes.  

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2010 Notes on each of December 15, 2016, 2020, 2025, on December 13, 2030 and on December 14, 2035, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2010 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2012 Notes on each of March 1, 2018, 2022, 2027 and 2032, and on March 2, 2037, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2012 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2013 Notes on each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 and 2037, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2013 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

We may redeem any of the 2007 Notes, 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes beginning December 18, 2013, December 19, 2016, March 6, 2018, and December 15, 2017, respectively. We may redeem all or a portion of the 2007 Notes, 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes (i.e., in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock) at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. On November 14, 2013, we announced that we had elected to redeem, on December 18, 2013, all of the then outstanding 2007 Notes (those 2007 Notes not put to us on December 13, 2013) at a redemption price payable in cash equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the 2007 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, December 18, 2013.

Table of Contents 

We have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to the convertible notes original issuance discount, representing the spread between the cash coupon rate and the higher interest rate deductible for tax purposes. When our convertible notes are extinguished, we are required to recapture the original issuance discount previously deducted for tax purposes. The estimated tax due upon our repurchase and redemption of the 2007 Notes is approximately $76 million.  

Stock Repurchase Program.  

On November 11, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our outstanding common stock over the next three years. Under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase, from time-to-time, shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in the United States. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will be determined based upon our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the program.  

Contingent Earn-Out Payments.  

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have the obligation to make contingent earn-out payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period. In certain circumstances, such as a change of control, a portion of these obligations may be accelerated. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn-out obligations may include covenants to operate the acquired businesses in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us. These provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. Our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances giving rise to the payment and our previous estimates, all or a portion of these payments may be required to be expensed by us when accrued. For example, our contingent earn-out obligations payable in connection with the TCT acquisition were expensed as accrued because our obligation to make these payments was conditioned on the continued employment of certain key employees of TCT.  

Our contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments. Pursuant to ASC 805, contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date. This liability is re-measured each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded through a separate line item within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from accretion of the liability for the passage of time, changes in discount rates, and changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates. Contingent consideration arrangements from acquisitions completed prior to the adoption of ASC 805 (effective in fiscal 2010 for us) that are deemed to be part of the purchase price of the acquisition are not subject to the fair value measurement requirements of ASC 805 and are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill.  

We had or continue to have contingent consideration obligations related to our Sentinelle Medical, Interlace, TCT and Healthcome acquisitions. Pursuant to ASC 805, contingent consideration pertaining to Sentinelle Medical and Interlace were required to be recorded as a liability at fair value and the adjustments to fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Contingent consideration pertaining to TCT and Healthcome were contingent upon future employment and were being recorded as compensation expense over the respective service periods. For additional information pertaining to the acquisitions, contingent consideration terms and the assumptions used to fair value contingent consideration, refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In connection with our acquisition of Sentinelle Medical, we had an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two-year period of up to a maximum of $250.0 million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. The measurement periods were completed in fiscal 2012, and we made payments of $3.4 million, $4.1 million and $4.3 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2013 and 2012, and the third quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively.  

In connection with our acquisition of Interlace, we had an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two-year period up to a maximum payout of $225.0 million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the first measurement period lapsed resulting in a total contingent amount recorded for this period of $51.8 million, which was disbursed to the former shareholders of Interlace, net of amounts withheld for certain legal indemnification purposes. The final measurement period ended during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, resulting in a contingent consideration liability of $93.8 million, of which $86.9 million was paid to the former Interlace stockholders in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The remainder was withheld for legal indemnification provisions and is being used to pay qualifying legal expenses. We recorded charges of $11.3 million, $41.8 million and $6.3 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.  

Under the sale and purchase agreement for TCT, $35.0 million of the purchase price had been deferred for one year from the date of the acquisition. This amount plus a portion of the working capital adjustment of $8.5 million were paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. An additional $4.7 million working capital adjustment payment became due upon the completion of fiscal 2013. In addition, we had an obligation to certain of the former shareholders, based on future employment, to make contingent payments over a two year period not to exceed $200.0 million less the deferred payment of $35.0 million. The first earn-out payment of $54.0 million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The second earn-out period was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and we paid $87.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. As of September 28, 2013, the Company had accrued $31.7 million related to this obligation, which was paid in November 2013.  

In connection with our acquisition of Healthcome, we have an obligation to the former shareholders to make contingent payments of $5.0 million over the next two fiscal years. In fiscal 2013, we paid $1.7 million and at September 28, 2013, we have accrued $3.4 million for these contingent payments.

Contractual Obligations  

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 28, 2013:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Included within long-term debt obligations, we have four issuances (2007 Notes, 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes) of convertible notes which can first be put to us on December 13, 2013 ($405 million principal), December 15, 2016 ($450 million principal), March 1, 2018 ($500 million principal), and December 15, 2017 ($370 million principal) and we have assumed for purpose of the above table that the principal amounts for each issuance will be paid off when they first can be put to us, which is in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. The 2013 Notes also have principal accretion of 4% annually, which is included in the principal amount in the 3-5 years column above. The amounts in the table do not include deferred tax liabilities for the recapture of the original issuance discount. See Convertible Notes above.  

 (2) The financing leases represent two leases for an office building and a manufacturing facility, which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under US GAAP. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

 (3) Amounts represent those recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Contingent Earn-Out Payments for a more complete description of our contingent earn-out obligations.  

 (4) Purchase obligations primarily represent minimum purchase commitments for inventory and instruments and, to a lesser extent, other operating expense commitments.  

 (5) Represents minimum royalties due on net sales of products incorporating licensed technology and subject to a minimum annual royalty payment, and payments under collaborative agreements. In addition to the minimum payments due under our collaborative agreements included above, we may be required to pay up to $4.8 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on net sales of any products using specified technology.  

 (6) Pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of $38.6 million, which is recorded as a current liability. Deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.  

The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under FIN 48 (codified primarily in ASC 740, Income Taxes) totaling $115.4 million. Due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above.

Future Liquidity Considerations  

We expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions and alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business. Subject to the Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and the general disclaimers set forth in our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report, we believe that cash flow from operations and the cash available under our Revolving Facility will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations, debt payments, including interest and deferred taxes as applicable, and contingent consideration obligations over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions or other investments, or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities. As described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Agreement, Senior Notes and convertible notes. These capital requirements could be substantial. Our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced Risk Factors set forth elsewhere in this report. These risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.  

Legal Contingencies  

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. In connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  

The following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

Inventory  

Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. As a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete  

92  

Table of Contents 

 or in excess of anticipated usage. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures on products and prices, and reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product expiration or end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future. If inventory is determined to be overvalued, excess or obsolete, we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results. When recorded, our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value.  

Accounts Receivable Reserves  

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors, including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non-payment, and evaluation of the customers current financial situation. In the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us, we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customers current credit worthiness. We continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, for example as a result of the ongoing financial and economic uncertainty or otherwise, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  

We also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. If the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected.  

Business Combinations  

We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. Contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario. These cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate. Quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.  

93  

Table of Contents 

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in-process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. Pursuant to ASC 805, we capitalize these assets and record them in our consolidated balance sheet. Under ASC 805, in-process research and development assets are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill and once the project is complete, if at all, the asset is amortized over its remaining useful life. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result.  

We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third-party would pay for the projects.  

We have also used the income approach, as described above, to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, customer relationships and contracts, and trade names. Developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know-how. Customer relationships represent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. Trade names represent acquired company and product names. For business licenses, we use a combination of the lost profits method and replacement cost method to value such assets. Business licenses allow us to conduct business in a certain country, namely China.  

With respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. Generally, we apply the cost approach as the primary method in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.  

Intangible Assets and Goodwill  

Intangible Assets  

We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 30 years. We review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write-down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. In assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. We generally  

94  

Table of Contents 

 calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in connection with the company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our MammoSite reporting unit, which is included in the Breast Health reportable segment. The impairment indicators were due to a reduction in our revenue projections and long-term growth rates as a result of the continuing deterioration of the brachytherapy market and competition from existing technologies. Our cash flow estimates were based upon historical cash flows, as well as future projected cash flows derived from the company-wide annual planning process. The analysis indicated that MammoSites long-lived assets were recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the predominant long-lived asset. We believe that our procedures for estimating future cash flows were reasonable and consistent with market conditions at the measurement date.  

Goodwill  

We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.  

In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC 350. The first step requires a comparison of the reporting units carrying value to its fair value. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. The valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies. We base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, of market participants. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. The second step requires us to perform a hypothetical purchase allocation as of the measurement date and estimate the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets is determined as described above and is subject to significant judgment.  

We conducted our fiscal 2013 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We utilized discounted cash flows, or DCF, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 30, 2013 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. As a result of completing Step 1, all of the reporting units, except for our Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit, which is within our Diagnostics reportable segment, had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required for those reporting units.  

As a result of our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure performed in the fourth quarter, we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit. The Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our Aptima business acquired in the Gen-Probe acquisition and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the Third Wave acquisition. The updated forecast, which reflects recent pricing pressures, is now lower, and the current projections for revenue and profitability are lower than those expected at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition.  

95

 As a result, the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying value. We performed Step 2 of the impairment test, consistent with the procedures described above, and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.1 billion. The basis of fair value for Molecular Diagnostics assumed the reporting unit would be purchased or sold in a taxable transaction, and the discount rate of 10% applied to the after-tax cash flows was relatively consistent with that used in our purchase accounting for the Gen-Probe acquisition. For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of Molecular Diagnostics been lower by 10%, the Company would have recorded an additional impairment charge of $195.4 million.  

For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each of our remaining reporting units been lower by 10%, all of our other reporting units would have still passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the DCF, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the WACC, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, significant judgment is applied in determining fair value. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher WACC because market participants would require a higher rate of return. In the DCF as the WACC increases, the fair value decreases. The other significant factor in the DCF is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit.  

At September 28, 2013, we believe that our other reporting units, with goodwill aggregating $2.5 billion were not at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts.  

We conducted our fiscal 2012 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We utilized DCF and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 24, 2012, and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. As a result of completing Step 1, all of our reporting units, except MammoSite, which is within our Breast Health segment, had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units. MammoSites fair value declined from fiscal 2011 primarily due to a reduction in our revenue projections and long-term growth rates. The changes in MammoSites financial projections were a result of the continuing deterioration of the brachytherapy market, and competition from existing technologies. We performed the Step 2 analysis for MammoSite, consistent with the procedures described above, and recorded a $5.8 million goodwill impairment charge, resulting in no remaining goodwill for this reporting unit. For our other reporting units, if their respective fair values had been lower by 10%, each reporting unit would have still passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.  

We conducted our fiscal 2011 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We utilized DCF and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 26, 2011, and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. As a result of completing Step 1, all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required. For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each reporting unit been lower by 10%, each reporting unit would have still passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.  

The estimate of fair value requires significant judgment. Any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded.

Revenue Recognition  

We generate revenue from the sale of products, primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems.  

We recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance, the sales price is fixed or determinable, no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Generally, our product arrangements for capital equipment sales, primarily in our Breast Health and Skeletal Health reporting segments, are multiple-element arrangements, including services, such as installation and training, and multiple products. In accordance with ASC 605-25, based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements, we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, revenue for services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as such services are performed. The relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered. There is no customer right of return in our sales agreements.  

Service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty, installation and training, and shipping and handling costs billed to customers. Service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed.  

For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we record revenue as separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control. Some of our products have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. We determined that except for our CAD products and C-View product, the software element in our other products is incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules and are not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, ASC 985-605, SoftwareRevenue Recognition. We determined that given the significance of the software components functionality to our CAD and C-View systems, which are sold by our Breast Health segment, these products are within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. We evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our other hardware products, including our Dimensions digital mammography systems, which have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality (i.e., it is a tangible product), and determined they are not within the scope of ASC 985-605.  

We are required to allocate revenue to multiple element arrangements based on the relative fair value of each elements selling price. We typically determine the selling price of our products based on our best estimate of selling price, referred to as ESP, and services based on vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, referred to as VSOE. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution, and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining VSOE. If VSOE cannot be established, which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent, or product pricing is not within a narrow range, we attempt to establish the selling price based on third-party evidence of selling price, referred to as TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we cannot determine VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross margin objectives, method of distribution, information gathered from experience in customer negotiations, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies.

For those arrangements accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules, ASC 985-605 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative VSOE of fair value. If VSOE does not exist for a delivered element, the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their VSOE with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements. For multiple-element software arrangements where VSOE of fair value of Post-Contract Customer Support, referred to as PCS, has been established, we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  

As part of our Diagnostics reporting segment and as a result of the Gen-Probe acquisition, we manufacture blood screening products according to demand schedules provided by our collaboration partner, Novartis. Our agreement provides that we share a portion of Novartiss revenue from screening blood donations. Upon shipment to Novartis, we recognize blood screening product sales at an agreed upon fixed transfer price, which is not refundable, and record the related cost of products sold. Based on the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis, our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user in excess of the transfer price revenues recognized is not known until it is reported to us by Novartis. On a monthly basis, Novartis reports net revenue generated during the prior month and remits an additional corresponding net payment to us which we record as revenue at that time. This payment combined with the transfer price revenues previously recognized represents our ultimate share of net revenue under the agreement.  

We sell our instruments to Novartis for use in blood screening and record these instrument sales upon delivery since Novartis is responsible for the placement, maintenance and repair of the units with its customers. We also sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers and record sales of these instruments upon delivery and customer acceptance. For certain customers with non-standard payment terms, instrument sales are recorded based upon expected cash collection. Prior to delivery, each instrument is tested to meet the Companys specifications and the specifications of the FDA, and is shipped fully assembled. Customer acceptance of the Companys clinical diagnostic instrument systems requires installation and training by our technical service personnel. Installation is a standard process consisting principally of uncrating, calibrating and testing the instrumentation.  

Within our Diagnostics business and, to a lesser extent, our Surgical business, we provide our instrumentation (for example, the ThinPrep Processor, ThinPrep Imaging System, Panther and Tigris) and certain other hardware to customers without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into a lease. Instead, we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation and equipment in the amount we charge for our diagnostic tests and assays and other disposables. Customers enter into a customer usage agreement, and we install the equipment at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term, which is typically between three and five years. Revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as tests, assays and other disposable products are shipped. The depreciation costs associated with an instrument are charged to cost of product sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the instrument. The costs to maintain these instruments in the field are charged to cost of product sales as incurred.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units issued to our employees. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisors model. The model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:  

Expected volatilityWe are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility, which is weighted based on a number of factors.

Expected termWe use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.  

Risk-free interest rateThe yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.  

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. ASC 718, Stock Compensation, requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on an analysis of historical forfeitures, we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 6% as of September 28, 2013 depending on the specific employee group. This analysis is re-evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.  

We recognized $52.3 million, $40.6 million and $35.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2013 was due to the addition of personnel and assumed stock options in the Gen-Probe acquisition and the acceleration of vesting for certain terminated employees. As of September 28, 2013, there was $30.0 million and $41.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years and 2.6 years, respectively.  

Income Taxes  

We use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between our assets and liabilities financial reporting and taxes bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.  

We have recognized $1.58 billion in net deferred tax liabilities at September 28, 2013 and $1.76 billion at September 29, 2012. The liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and debt. The tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we could realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.  

We had $121.8 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, at September 28, 2013 and $53.1 million at September 29, 2012. The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased $68.7 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a $58.4 million increase related to the convertible note exchange in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. At September 28, 2013, $61.0 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate. In the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $2.0 to $4.0 million due to statute of limitations expiring and favorably settling with taxing authorities, both reducing our effective tax rate.  

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. While we consider our

 estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exist. ASU 2013-11 amends the presentation requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes, and requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. To the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets. The ASU is for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2013-11 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The ASU is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.  

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. ASU 2011-11 amended ASC 210, Balance Sheet, to converge the presentation of offsetting assets and liabilities between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-11 requires that entities disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after January 1, 2013, which is our fiscal year 2014. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2011-11 on its consolidated financial statements.
