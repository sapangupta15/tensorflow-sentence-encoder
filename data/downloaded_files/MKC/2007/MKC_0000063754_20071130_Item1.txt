Item 1. Business 

 The Registrant is a diversified specialty food company and a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of flavor products (including spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings) and other specialty food products to the entire food industry. The Registrants major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America and Europe. Additional facilities are located in Mexico, Central America, Australia, China, Singapore, Thailand and South Africa. The Registrant was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. 

 The Registrant operates in two business segments: consumer and industrial. The consumer segment sells spices, herbs, extracts, seasoning blends, sauces, marinades and specialty foods to the consumer food market under a variety of brands worldwide, including McCormick, Zatarains, Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Ducros, Vahine, Silvo, Club House and Schwartz. The industrial segment sells seasoning blends, natural spices and herbs, wet flavors, coating systems and compound flavors to food manufacturers and the food service industry, served both directly and indirectly through distributors.

Raw Materials 

 The most significant raw materials to the Registrant are cheese, pepper, soybean oil, wheat, sweeteners, capsicums, garlic and onion. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Others, like cheese and onion, are primarily sourced from within the United States. The Registrant is not aware of any government restrictions or other factors that would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions and other factors beyond the Registrants control. The Registrant responds to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. 

Customers 

 The Registrants products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are resold to consumers through retail outlets, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores under a variety of brands. In the industrial segment, products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by food service customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers and the food service industry, which are supplied both directly and through distributors. 

 The Registrant has a large number of customers for its products. In fiscal year 2007, sales to one of the Registrants customers, PepsiCo, Inc., accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales. Sales to the Registrants five largest customers represented approximately 28.5% of consolidated net sales for this period. 

 The dollar amount of backlog orders of the Registrants business is not material to an understanding of the Registrants business, taken as a whole. No material portion of the Registrants business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents 

 The Registrant owns a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks may be material to the Registrants business, the loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of the Registrants McCormick, Club House, Ducros, Schwartz, Vahine and Zatarains trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrants business. The McCormick trademark is extensively used by the Registrant in connection with the sale of virtually all of the Registrants food products worldwide. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as the Registrant deems them to be useful. 

 The Registrant has entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of its trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrants business. The term of the license agreements is generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties. 

 The Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material to the Registrants business. 

Seasonality 

 Due to seasonal factors inherent in the business, the Registrants sales, income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. The seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment. 

Working Capital 

 In order to meet increased demand for its consumer products during its fourth quarter, the Registrant usually builds its inventories during the third quarter. The Registrant generally finances working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper.

Competition 

 The Registrant is a global leader in the manufacture and sale of flavor products (including spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings) and other specialty food products, and competes in a geographic market that is international and highly competitive. The Registrants strategies for competing in each of its segments include a focus on price and value, product quality and innovation, and superior service. Additionally, in the consumer segment, the Registrant focuses on brand recognition and loyalty, effective advertising and promotional programs, and the identification and satisfaction of consumer preferences.
