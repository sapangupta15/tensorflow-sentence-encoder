Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  

Overview  

Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide through sales to its customers and directly to consumers. Mattels business is dependent in great part on its ability each year to redesign, restyle, and extend existing core products and product lines, to design and develop innovative new products and product lines, and to successfully market those products and product lines. Mattel plans to continue to focus on its portfolio of traditional brands that have historically had worldwide appeal, to create new brands utilizing its knowledge of childrens play patterns, and to target customer and consumer preferences around the world.  

Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories:  

Mattel Girls & Boys Brandsincluding Barbie® fashion dolls and accessories (Barbie®), Polly Pocket®, Little Mommy®, Disney Classics, Pixel Chix®, and High School Musical (collectively Other Girls Brands), Hot Wheels®, Matchbox®, and Tyco® R/C vehicles and playsets (collectively Wheels), and CARS, Radica® products, and games and puzzles (collectively Entertainment).  

Fisher-Price Brandsincluding Fisher-Price®, Little People®, BabyGear, and View-Master® (collectively Core Fisher-Price®), Sesame Street®, Dora the Explorer, Winnie the Pooh, Go-Diego-Go!, and See N Say® (collectively Fisher-Price® Friends), and Power Wheels®.  

American Girl Brandsincluding Just Like You®, the historical collection and Bitty Baby®. American Girl Brands products are sold directly to consumers, and its childrens publications are also sold to certain retailers.  

On October 10, 2005, Mattel announced the consolidation of its domestic Mattel Girls & Boys Brands and Fisher-Price Brands divisions into one division. The creation of the Mattel Brands division, which resulted in the consolidation of some management and support functions, preserves the natural marketing and design groups that are empowered to create and market toys based on gender and age groups and is expected to more effectively and efficiently leverage Mattels scale. These changes are consistent with Mattels ongoing goals to enhance innovation and improve execution. In connection with this consolidation, Mattel executed an initiative in 2006 to streamline its workforce, primarily in El Segundo, California. The consolidation of these divisions did not change Mattels operating segments.  

Management believes that the business environment for Mattel in 2008 will be similar to that of 2007. Mattel expects to continue facing challenges both domestically and internationally as retailers continue to tightly manage inventory. Additionally, Mattel has experienced continued cost pressures, including higher product costs for commodities, labor, and foreign currency. Management believes that Mattel will continue to encounter a challenging retail environment, along with cost pressures. Additionally, in 2008, Mattel will incur higher product testing costs and, until all recall-related legal matters are resolved, additional legal expenses.  

Mattels objective is to continue to create long-term shareholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established three overarching goals.  

The first goal is to enhance innovation in order to reinvigorate the Barbie® brand, while maintaining growth in other core brands by continuing to develop popular toys. Additionally, Mattel plans to pursue additional licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to extend its portfolio of brands into areas outside of traditional toys.  

28  

The second goal is to improve execution in areas including manufacturing, distribution, and selling. Mattel continues to focus on improving the efficiency of its supply chain using Lean supply chain initiatives. The objective of the Lean program is to improve the flow of processes, do more with less, and focus on the value chain from beginning to end.  

The third goal is to further capitalize on Mattels scale advantage. For example, as the worlds largest toy company, Mattel believes it can realize cost savings when making purchasing decisions based on a One Mattel philosophy.  

Product Recalls and Withdrawals  

During the third quarter of 2007, Mattel recalled products with high-powered magnets that may become dislodged and other products, some of which were produced using non-approved paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory and Mattel standards (collectively, the Third Quarter of 2007 Recalls). Additional products were recalled, withdrawn from retail stores, or replaced at the request of consumers in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of small parts separating from a product, some instances of paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory standards in another product, and the presence of lead in the substrate in excess of an Illinois regulatory standard in other products (collectively, along with the Third Quarter of 2007 Recalls, the 2007 Product Recalls).  

As a result of the Third Quarter of 2007 Recalls, Mattel intentionally slowed down its shipments out of Asia while it conducted extensive product testing in the third quarter of 2007. Also, export licenses at several manufacturing facilities in China were temporarily suspended in September 2007 while safety procedures were reviewed, but all licenses were in place at December 31, 2007. Mattels ability to import products into certain countries was also temporarily impacted by product recalls as certain countries and regulatory authorities reviewed Mattels safety procedures; however, these import and export issues were largely resolved early in the fourth quarter of 2007 and did not have a significant financial impact on Mattels 2007 results.  

The third quarter of 2007 recall of products with high-powered magnets was a recall of older toys that do not meet Mattels current magnet retention system requirements. Since November 2006, when Mattel conducted its first voluntary recall for magnetic toys, Mattel has implemented enhanced magnet retention systems across all of its brands. At the beginning of 2007, all magnets must be locked into the plastic toy with sturdy material holding in the edges around the exposed face of the magnet or completely covering or encapsulating the magnet. Mattel also conducted an extensive review of technical data and consumer information on all magnetic toys and is confident in the new requirements, based on its continued testing and consumer experience.  

In July 2007, Mattel determined that certain products, manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturer in China, were produced using non-approved paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory standards. As a result, and also in July 2007, Mattel launched a thorough investigation and expanded its testing programs to ensure that painted finished goods, at third-party contract manufacturers as well as facilities operated by Mattel, are systematically tested prior to being shipped to customers. The expanded testing programs include a check system to enforce compliance with all regulations and standards applicable to lead paint. Mattel has also created a new Corporate Responsibility organization, which has an even greater level of accountability internally and externally for adherence to the companys safety and compliance protocols.  

Although management is not aware of any additional significant issues associated with lead in paints used on, or lead in substrate used in, its products, there can be no assurance that additional issues will not be identified in the future. Mattel believes that it has some of the most rigorous quality and safety testing procedures in the toy industry. Management also believes that Mattels history of acting responsibly and quickly will maintain the trust of its customers and consumers. However, the 2007 Product Recalls may have a negative impact on both customer and consumer demand for Mattels products in the future.

Results of Operations  

2007 Compared to 2006  

Consolidated Results  

Net sales for 2007 were $5.97 billion, a 6% increase as compared to $5.65 billion in 2006, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2007 was $600.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $592.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, for 2006.  

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 46.5% in 2007 from 46.2% in 2006. The increase in gross profit was driven by price increases and favorable changes in currency exchange rates, which were partially offset by external cost pressures and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which reduced gross profit by approximately $71 million.  

Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales declined to 11.8% in 2007 from 12.1% in 2006. Contributing to this decline were higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and higher advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher gross margins, lower interest expense, and higher other non-operating income. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses in 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased other selling and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million. Higher investments in the business, including design and development costs and expansion in international markets, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increases in employee-related costs, and the inclusion of Radica costs also contributed to the increase. These costs increases were partially offset by lower 2007 incentive and equity compensation expenses. Other selling and administrative expenses in 2006 included $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors. Other non-operating income, net increased from $4.3 million in 2006 to $11.0 million in 2007, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains.  

Net income in 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million due to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes. Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May 2006 and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of multiple ongoing audits by foreign and state tax authorities.  

The following table provides a summary of Mattels consolidated results for 2007 and 2006 (in millions, except percentage and basis point information):

Sales  

Net sales for 2007 were $5.97 billion, a 6% increase as compared to $5.65 billion in 2006, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. The 2007 Product Recalls reduced net sales by approximately $48.9 million for sales returns and reserves recorded in 2007. Gross sales in international markets increased 17% as compared to 2006, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Gross sales within the US decreased 1% from 2006, and accounted for 51% and 56% of consolidated gross sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

Worldwide gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands increased 8% to $3.70 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, including a 5 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands decreased 4% and international gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands increased 18%, including an 8 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Barbie® increased by 1%, including a 4 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales of Barbie® decreased by 15%, primarily driven by sales declines in Barbie® Fantasy and My Scene® products, partially offset by sales increases in Barbie® Collector products. International gross sales of Barbie® increased by 12%, including an 8 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily due to higher sales of Barbie® Reality and Barbie® Collector products. Softness in Barbie® Fantasy products worldwide was driven by the underperformance of toys associated with the 2007 Barbie® entertainment properties, Barbie® Magic of the Rainbow and Barbie as the Island Princess as compared to the 2006 entertainment properties, Barbie® in Fairytopia II: Mermaidia® and Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses®. Worldwide gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 2% from 2006, including a 5 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by strong sales of Little Mommy® and High School Musical, partially offset by sales declines of Winx Club and Pixel Chix® worldwide, and Polly Pocket® in the US.  

Worldwide gross sales of Wheels products increased 14% as compared to 2006, including a 4 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in Hot Wheels® and Matchbox® products. Worldwide gross sales of Entertainment products, which includes games and puzzles and Radica®, increased by 16% as compared to 2006, including a 5 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by continued strong worldwide sales in CARS products and inclusion of Radica® sales, partially offset by sales declines in Superman products.  

Worldwide gross sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 8% to $2.44 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Core Fisher-Price® increased 19% as compared to 2006, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by the continued strength of infant, preschool, learning, and BabyGear sales. Worldwide gross sales of Fisher-Price® Friends decreased 15% as compared to 2006, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily due to some properties declining from strong 2006 levels, partially offset by higher Sesame Street® sales during 2007.  

Gross sales of American Girl Brands decreased 2% to $431.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily driven by the continued softness in the direct channel and lower sales of established historical characters, partially offset by strong sales of the Girl of the Year®, Nicki, the launch of the newest historical character, Julie, and sales from the American Girl Boutique and Bistro retail stores, which opened in Atlanta, Georgia in August 2007 and Dallas, Texas in November 2007.  

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales increased by $154.4 million, or 5%, from $3.04 billion in 2006 to $3.19 billion in 2007, as compared to a 6% increase in net sales. On an overall basis, cost of sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased cost of sales by approximately $22 million. Within cost of sales, product costs increased by $150.6 million, or 6%, from $2.42 billion in 2006 to   

31  

 $2.57 billion in 2007, primarily driven by increased sales volume, higher external cost pressures, and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, partially offset by cost savings realized from supply chain efficiency initiatives. Royalty expense decreased by $17.9 million, or 7%, from $261.2 million in 2006 to $243.3 million in 2007, and is reflective of lower sales of licensed products in 2007. Freight and logistics expenses increased by $21.7 million, or 6%, from $357.3 million in 2006 to $379.0 million in 2007, primarily driven by increased sales volume.  

Gross Profit  

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.5% in 2007, as compared to 46.2% in 2006. The improvement in gross profit was primarily driven by the alignment of prices with increased input costs and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by external cost pressures and an 80 basis point negative impact from the 2007 Product Recalls.  

Advertising and Promotion Expenses  

Advertising and promotion expenses increased to 11.9% of net sales in 2007, from 11.5% in 2006 due primarily to additional media and promotion to drive consumer demand at retail. Also, the 2007 Product Recalls increased advertising and promotion expenses by approximately $5 million.  

Other Selling and Administrative Expenses  

Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.34 billion in 2007, or 22.4% of net sales, as compared to $1.23 billion in 2006, or 21.8% of net sales. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses in 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased other selling and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million. Higher investments in the business, including design and development costs and expansion in international markets, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increases in employee-related costs, and the inclusion of Radica costs also contributed to the increase. The higher costs were partially offset by lower 2007 incentive and equity compensation expenses. Other selling and administrative expenses in 2006 included $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors.  

Non-Operating Items  

Interest expense was $71.0 million in 2007 as compared to $79.9 million in 2006 due to lower average borrowings. Interest income increased from $30.5 million in 2006 to $33.3 million in 2007 due to higher average invested cash balances and higher interest rates. Other non-operating income, net increased from $4.3 million in 2006 to $11.0 million in 2007, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

Net income in 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million as a result of reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes.  

Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May 2006, and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of ongoing audits with foreign and state tax authorities.  

Operating Segment Results  

Mattels operating segments are separately managed business units and are divided on a geographic basis between domestic and international. The Domestic segment is further divided into Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US and American Girl Brands. Operating segment results should be read in conjunction   

32  

 with Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 11 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSegment Information.  

Domestic Segment  

Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US gross sales decreased 4% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Within this segment, gross sales of Barbie® products decreased 15%, primarily driven by sales declines of Barbie® Fantasy and My Scene® products, partially offset by higher sales of Barbie® Collector products. Gross sales of Other Girls Brands decreased 3%, primarily driven by sales declines in Polly Pocket® and Pixel Chix®, partially offset by strong sales of High School Musical and Little Mommy® products. Gross sales of Wheels products increased 2%, primarily due to sales increases in Matchbox®, partially offset by lower sales of Tyco® R/C products. Gross sales in Entertainment products, which includes games and puzzles and Radica®, increased 1%, primarily driven by the continued strong sales of CARS products and the inclusion of Radica® sales, partially offset by sales declines in Superman products. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US segment income decreased 21% to $212.2 million in 2007, primarily due to lower sales volume, higher other selling and administrative expenses, and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which lowered Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US segment income by approximately $12 million.  

Fisher-Price Brands US gross sales increased 3%, reflecting an increase in sales of Core Fisher-Price® products, partially offset by sales declines of Fisher-Price® Friends products. Sales increases in Core Fisher-Price® products reflected strong sales of learning, infant, BabyGear, and preschool products. Sales declines of Fisher-Price® Friends products were primarily due to some properties declining from strong 2006 levels, partially offset by higher Sesame Street® sales during 2007. Fisher-Price Brands US segment income increased 4% to $225.5 million in 2007, primarily due to higher sales volume and improved gross profit resulting from price increases and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expenses and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which decreased Fisher-Price Brands US segment operating income by approximately $30 million.  

American Girl Brands gross sales decreased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to the continued softness in the direct channel and lower sales of established historical characters, partially offset by strong sales of the Girl of the Year®, Nicki, the launch of the newest historical character, Julie, and sales from the American Girl Boutique and Bistro retail stores which opened in Atlanta, Georgia in August 2007 and Dallas, Texas in November 2007. American Girl Brands segment operating income increased 2% to $98.5 million in 2007.  

International Segment  

The following table provides a summary of percentage changes in gross sales within the International segment in 2007 versus 2006:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

International gross sales increased 17% in 2007 as compared to 2006, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Gross sales of Barbie® increased 12%, including an 8 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily due to higher sales of Barbie® Reality and Barbie® Collector products. Gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 4%, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by increased sales of Little Mommy® and Polly Pocket®,   

33  

 partially offset by declines in Winx Club and Pixel Chix®. Gross sales of Wheels products grew by 24%, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, reflecting growth in Hot Wheels® and Matchbox®. Gross sales of Entertainment products increased by 31%, including a 9 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by strong sales of CARS products and the inclusion of Radica® sales, partially offset by sales declines of Superman products. Fisher-Price Brands gross sales increased 17%, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, due to higher sales of Core Fisher-Price® products, primarily infant, preschool, BabyGear, newborn, and learning products, partially offset by sales declines of Fisher-Price® Friends products. International segment income was relatively flat with prior year at $420.9 million, primarily due to increased sales volume, offset by higher other selling and administrative expenses and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which decreased International segment operating income by approximately $47 million.  

2006 Compared to 2005  

Consolidated Results  

Net sales for 2006 were $5.65 billion, a 9% increase as compared to $5.18 billion in 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2006 was $592.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $417.0 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for 2005.  

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 46.2% in 2006 from 45.8% in 2005. The increase in gross profit was driven by price increases and savings from supply chain initiatives, which were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, external cost pressures, and higher royalty costs.  

Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales declined to 12.1% in 2006 from 12.6% in 2005. Contributing to this decline were higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and lower other non-operating income, partially offset by higher gross margins and lower advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Higher selling and administrative expenses were primarily attributed to increased incentive compensation accruals, stock-based compensation including a pre-tax charge of $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors (see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsShare-Based Payments), costs associated with the opening of the third American Girl Place® retail store in April 2006 and the acquisition of Radica in October 2006, partially offset by savings related to the streamlining of the Mattel Brands organization. Other non-operating income, net in 2005 included gains from the sale of marketable securities of $25.8 million. There were no gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities in 2006.  

Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May, and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of multiple ongoing audits by foreign and state tax authorities. Net income in 2005 was negatively impacted by incremental tax expense of $107.0 million, resulting from Mattels decision to repatriate $2.4 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Act, partially offset by $38.6 million of tax benefits primarily relating to tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world.  

Shares repurchased under Mattels share repurchase program resulted in a benefit to Mattels earnings per share in 2006 when compared to 2005, by reducing the average number of common shares outstanding.

The following table provides a summary of Mattels consolidated results for 2006 and 2005 (in millions, except percentage and basis point information):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Sales  

Net sales for 2006 were $5.65 billion, a 9% increase as compared to $5.18 billion in 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Gross sales within the US increased 8% from 2005 and accounted for 56% of consolidated gross sales in 2006 and 2005. In 2006, gross sales in international markets increased 11% as compared to 2005, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates.  

Worldwide gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands increased 9% to $3.42 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, including fourth quarter sales of Radica® products and a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales increased 10% and international gross sales increased 8%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Barbie® were flat, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales of Barbie® increased 3% and international gross sales of Barbie® decreased 2%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 11% from 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by strong sales of Polly Pocket® and Pixel Chix® worldwide and the continued success of Winx Club in international markets.  

Worldwide gross sales of Wheels products decreased 1% as compared to 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Strong sales of Hot Wheels® and Matchbox® products internationally were more than offset by Hot Wheels® sales declines in the US and Tyco® R/C sales declines worldwide. Worldwide gross sales of Entertainment products, which includes games and puzzles and Radica®, increased by 34% as compared to 2005, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding Radica® products, increases in worldwide gross sales of Entertainment products, were driven by the worldwide success of CARS and Superman products, which more than offset worldwide sales declines of Batman and Yu-Gi-Oh! products.  

Worldwide gross sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 12% to $2.27 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales increased 8%, while international gross sales increased 20%, including a benefit of 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Core Fisher-Price® increased 11% as compared to 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by the worldwide success of BabyGear and infant and newborn products. Worldwide gross sales of   

35  

 Fisher-Price® Friends increased 19% as compared to 2005, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, driven by several Nickelodeon properties including Go-Diego-Go!, Dora the Explorer, and The Backyardigans, and T.M.X Elmo from Sesame Street®.  

Gross sales of American Girl Brands increased 1% to $440.0 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, driven by the American Girl Place® retail stores, including American Girl®s third store which opened in Los Angeles, California in April 2006. Growth in the retail stores was partially offset by a decline in the catalog business.  

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales increased by $232.2 million, or 8%, from $2.81 billion in 2005 to $3.04 billion in 2006, as compared to a 9% increase in net sales. On an overall basis, cost of sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume. Within cost of sales, product costs increased by $204.9 million, or 9%, from $2.21 billion in 2005 to $2.42 billion in 2006, which was primarily driven by increased sales volume and higher external cost pressures, partially offset by cost savings realized from supply chain efficiency initiatives. Royalty expense increased by $35.6 million, or 16%, from $225.6 million in 2005 to $261.2 million in 2006, and is reflective of higher sales of licensed products in 2006. Freight and logistics expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 2%, from $365.5 million in 2005 to $357.3 million in 2006. The decrease in freight and logistics expenses was primarily due to supply chain savings and distribution center efficiency initiatives, including strategies to shorten customer shipping distances, partially offset by increased sales volume.  

Gross Profit  

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.2% in 2006 as compared to 45.8% in 2005. The increase in gross profit was driven by price increases and supply chain savings, which were partially offset by higher external cost pressures and unfavorable product mix, including higher royalty costs for licensed products.  

Advertising and Promotion Expenses  

Advertising and promotion expenses decreased to 11.5% of net sales in 2006, as compared to 12.1% in 2005, due primarily to overall higher sales volume and greater leverage in advertising spending.  

Other Selling and Administrative Expenses  

Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.23 billion in 2006, or 21.8% of net sales, as compared to $1.08 billion in 2005, or 20.8% of net sales. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses in 2006 is primarily attributable to an $86.3 million increase in incentive compensation accruals, an increase of $27.3 million in stock-based compensation, including a pre-tax charge of $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors (see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsShare-Based Payments), costs associated with the third American Girl Place® retail store, and additional selling and administrative expenses for Radica (acquired in October 2006), partially offset by savings related to the 2006 streamlining of the Mattel Brands organization.  

Non-Operating Items  

Interest expense was $79.9 million in 2006 as compared to $76.5 million in 2005 due to higher average long-term borrowings and higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower average short-term borrowings. Interest income decreased from $34.2 million in 2005 to $30.5 million in 2006 due to lower average invested cash balances. Other non-operating income, net was $4.3 million as compared to $29.8 million in 2005. Other non-operating income in 2005 included gains from the sale of marketable securities of $25.8 million. There were no gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities in 2006.  

36  

Provision for Income Taxes  

Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May 2006, and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of ongoing audits with foreign and state tax authorities, which were recorded in the first two quarters of 2006. Net income in 2005 was negatively impacted by incremental tax expense of $107.0 million, resulting from Mattels decision to repatriate $2.4 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Act, partially offset by $38.6 million of tax benefits primarily relating to tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world.  

Operating Segment Results  

Mattels operating segments are separately managed business units and are divided on a geographic basis between domestic and international. The Domestic segment is further divided into Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, and American Girl Brands. Operating segment results should be read in conjunction with Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 11 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSegment Information.  

Domestic Segment  

Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US gross sales increased 10% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Within this segment, gross sales of Barbie® increased 3% and gross sales of Other Girls Brands decreased 5%. Gross sales of Wheels products decreased 9% driven by sales declines in Hot Wheels® and Tyco® R/C product lines. Gross sales of Entertainment products, which includes games and puzzles and Radica®, increased 61% driven by the success of CARS and Superman products and Radica® products, which more than offset sales declines in Batman and Yu-Gi-Oh!. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US segment income increased 29% to $267.2 million in 2006, primarily due to higher sales volume and improved gross profit, partially offset by higher other selling and administrative expenses. The increase in gross profit is due to higher sales volume, including Radica® products, price increases, and supply chain savings, partially offset by external cost pressures and unfavorable product mix.  

Fisher-Price Brands US gross sales increased 8%, reflecting an increase in sales of Core Fisher Price® and Fisher Price® Friends products. Sale increases in Core Fisher Price® products reflected strong sales of BabyGear  and infant and newborn products. Sales increases in Fisher-Price® Friends were driven by several Nickelodeon properties including Go-Diego-Go!, Dora the Explorer, and The Backyardigans and Sesame Street®. Fisher-Price Brands US segment income increased 25% to $216.1 million in 2006, primarily due to higher sales volume and improved gross profit resulting from price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher external cost pressures.  

American Girl Brands gross sales increased 1% from the prior year. American Girl Brands segment income decreased from $106.2 million to $97.0 million in 2006, primarily driven by higher other selling and administrative expenses associated with the American Girl Place® retail store in Los Angeles which opened in 2006.

International Segment  

The following table provides a summary of percentage changes in gross sales within the International segment in 2006 versus 2005:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

International gross sales increased 11% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Gross sales of Barbie® decreased 2%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 26%, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by increased sales of Polly Pocket®, Pixel Chix® and Winx Club. Gross sales of Wheels products grew by 7%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, mainly driven by the success of Hot Wheels® and Matchbox® products, partially offset by Tyco® R/C sales declines. Gross sales of Entertainment products increased by 15%, mainly due to strong sales in CARS and Superman products, which more than offset declines in sales of Batman and Yu-Gi-Oh! products. Fisher-Price Brands gross sales increased 20%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, due to increased sales of Core Fisher-Price® products, primarily infant and newborn and BabyGear products and growth in Fisher-Price® Friends, mainly Dora the Explorer and Go-Diego-Go! properties, and T.M.X. Elmo from Sesame Street®. International segment income increased 33% to $419.1 million in 2006, as a result of an increase in sales volume, improved gross profit and benefits from changes in currency exchange rates. Improved gross profit resulted from price increases, partially offset by external cost pressures, unfavorable product mix, and higher royalty costs.  

Income Taxes  

Mattels effective tax rate on income before income taxes in 2007 was 14.7% as compared to 13.3% in 2006. The 2007 income tax provision includes net benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million related to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes. The 2006 income tax provision includes a benefit of $63.0 million related to settlements with foreign and state tax authorities. Of the total benefit recorded in 2006, $57.5 million represents refunds of previously paid taxes, recorded as an expense in previous years. These refunds were recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period the refunds were received by Mattel. The balance of the tax benefit recorded in 2006 was a net reduction to total income tax reserves resulting from tax settlements with foreign and state tax authorities. The 2006 income tax provision was also positively impacted by approximately $37 million as a result of the Tax Act passed in May 2006.  

The 2005 income tax provision includes US federal and state taxes of $107.0 million related to Mattels repatriation of $2.4 billion in qualifying dividends from Mattels foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the Jobs Act. The 2005 effective tax rate also includes a tax benefit of $38.6 million as a result of tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Mattels primary sources of liquidity are its cash balances, access to short-term borrowing facilities, and issuances of long-term debt securities. Cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for Mattels products, which could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions and changes in public and consumer preferences, or by increased costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of products or shortages in raw materials or component parts. Additionally, Mattels ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements, which include maintaining consolidated debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios, or a deterioration of Mattels credit ratings. Mattels ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity.  

Capital and Investment Framework  

To guide future capital deployment decisions, with a goal of maximizing shareholder value, Mattels Board of Directors in 2003 established the following capital and investment framework:  

       To maintain approximately $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash available to fund a substantial portion of seasonal working capital;  

       To maintain a year-end debt-to-capital ratio of about 25%;  

       To invest approximately $180 million to $200 million in capital expenditures annually to maintain and grow the business;  

       To make strategic acquisitions consistent with Mattels vision of providing the worlds premier toy brandstoday and tomorrow; and  

       To return excess funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  

Over the long-term, assuming cash flows from operating activities remain strong, Mattel plans to use its free cash flows to invest in strategic acquisitions and to return funds to shareholders through cash dividends and, depending on market conditions, share repurchases. However, the ability to implement successfully the capital deployment plan is directly dependent on Mattels ability to generate strong cash flows from operating activities. There is no assurance that Mattel will continue to generate strong cash flows from operating activities or achieve its targeted goals from investing activities.  

Operating Activities  

Cash flows generated from operating activities were $560.5 million during 2007, as compared to $875.9 million in 2006, and $466.7 million in 2005. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2007 from 2006 was primarily the result of higher working capital requirements, mainly due to lower sales of receivables, the timing of vendor payments, and lower accruals for incentive and royalty obligations. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result of higher net income and lower working capital, mainly due to higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses due primarily to higher incentive accruals, and the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by higher accounts receivable.  

Investing Activities  

Cash flows used for investing activities were $285.3 million during 2007, primarily due to the acquisition of Origin Products Limited (Origin) for $79.1 million, the purchase of rights to manufacture, distribute, and market several game properties for $25.3 million, the purchase of a $35.0 million long-term investment security, and purchases of other property, plant, and equipment. Cash flows used for investing activities were lower in 2007 as compared to 2006 mainly due to lower payments for businesses acquired, partially offset by the purchase of a long-term investment security, higher purchases of other property, plant, and equipment, and lower proceeds   

39  

 from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. Cash flows used for investing activities were higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the Radica acquisition and lower proceeds from the sale of investments.  

Financing Activities  

Cash flows used for financing activities increased to $587.8 million in 2007 from $374.1 million in 2006 as a result of higher share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and higher net borrowings. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $163.2 million to $374.1 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of lower share repurchases and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by lower net borrowings in 2006 and increased dividend payments.  

During 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Board of Directors authorized Mattel to increase its share repurchase program by $750.0 million, $250.0 million, and $500.0 million, respectively. During 2007, Mattel repurchased 35.9 million shares at a cost of $806.3 million. During 2006, Mattel repurchased 11.8 million shares at a cost of $192.7 million. During 2005, Mattel repurchased 28.9 million shares at a cost of $500.4 million. At December 31, 2007, share repurchase authorizations of $0.9 million had not been executed. In January 2008, the Board of Directors authorized Mattel to increase its previously announced share repurchase program by an additional $500.0 million. Repurchases will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. Mattels share repurchase program has no expiration date. 

In 2007, 2006, and 2005, Mattel paid a $0.75 per share, $0.65 per share, and $0.50 per share dividend to holders of its common stock, respectively. The Board of Directors declared the dividend in November, and Mattel paid the dividend in December of each year. The dividend payments were $272.3 million, $249.5 million, and $200.5 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  

Seasonal Financing  

Mattel maintains and periodically amends or replaces a $1.3 billion domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a commercial bank group that is used as the primary source of financing for the seasonal working capital requirements of its domestic subsidiaries. The agreement in effect expires on March 23, 2010 and interest is charged at various rates selected by Mattel, ranging from market commercial paper rates to the bank reference rate. The credit facility contains a variety of covenants, including financial covenants, that require Mattel to maintain certain consolidated debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios. Specifically, Mattel is required to meet these financial covenant ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter and fiscal year, using the formulae specified in the credit agreement to calculate the ratios. Mattel was in compliance with such covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter and fiscal year in 2007. As of December 31, 2007, Mattels consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, as calculated per the terms of the credit agreement, was 0.35 to 1 (compared to a maximum allowed of 0.50 to 1) and Mattels interest coverage ratio was 13.33 to 1 (compared to a minimum allowed of 3.50 to 1).  

The domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility is a material agreement and failure to comply with the financial covenant ratios may result in an event of default under the terms of the facility. If Mattel defaulted under the terms of the domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility, its ability to meet its seasonal financing requirements could be adversely affected.  

In December 2005, Mattel, MAPS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mattel, Bank of America, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and other financial institutions executed a credit agreement (the MAPS facility) which provided for (i) a term loan facility of $225.0 million consisting of a term loan advanced to MAPS in the original principal amount of $225.0 million, with $50.0 million of such amount to be repaid on each of December 15, 2006 and December 15, 2007, and the remaining aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million to be repaid on December 9, 2008, and (ii) a revolving loan facility consisting of revolving loans advanced to MAPS in the maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding of $100.0 million, with a maturity date of December 9, 2008. Interest was   

40  

 charged at various rates selected by Mattel based on Eurodollar rates or bank reference rates. On December 15, 2006, in addition to the required payment of $50.0 million, MAPS prepaid an incremental $125.0 million of the MAPS term loan facility. The remaining $50.0 million principal amount, consisting of $14.3 million due on December 15, 2007 and $35.7 million due on December 9, 2008, was prepaid on January 16, 2007. As a result of such pre-payments, the MAPS term loan facility terminated in accordance with its terms, but the MAPS revolving loan facility remained in effect. On March 26, 2007, Mattel terminated the MAPS revolving loan facility. Mattel did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the MAPS revolving loan facility.  

To finance seasonal working capital requirements of certain foreign subsidiaries, Mattel obtains individual short-term credit lines with a number of banks. As of December 31, 2007, foreign credit lines totaled approximately $200 million, a portion of which are used to support letters of credit. Mattel expects to extend the majority of these credit lines throughout 2008.  

In June 2006, Mattel issued $100.0 million of unsecured floating rate senior notes (Floating Rate Senior Notes) due June 15, 2009 and $200.0 million of unsecured 6.125% senior notes (6.125% Senior Notes) due June 15, 2011 (collectively Senior Notes). Interest on the Floating Rate Senior Notes is based on the three-month US dollar LIBOR plus 40 basis points with interest payable quarterly beginning September 15, 2006. Interest on the 6.125% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning December 15, 2006. The 6.125% Senior Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of Mattel at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date, or (ii) a make whole amount based on the yield of a comparable US Treasury security plus 20 basis points.  

In June 2006, Mattel entered into two interest rate swap agreements on the $100.0 million Floating Rate Senior Notes, each with a notional amount of $50.0 million, for the purpose of hedging the variability of cash flows in the interest payments due to fluctuations of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. These cash flow hedges are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, whereby the hedges are reported in Mattels consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the hedges reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under the terms of the agreements, Mattel receives quarterly interest payments from the swap counterparties based on the three-month LIBOR plus 40 basis points and makes semi-annual interest payments to the swap counterparties based on a fixed rate of 5.87125%. The three-month LIBOR used to determine interest payments under the interest rate swap agreements resets every three months, matching the variable interest on the Floating Rate Senior Notes. The agreements expire in June 2009, which corresponds with the maturity of the Floating Rate Senior Notes.  

In September 2007, a major credit rating agency reaffirmed Mattels long-term credit rating at BBB-, but changed the outlook from positive to stable. In August 2007, another major credit rating agency maintained its long-term credit rating at BBB, but changed its outlook to positive. In May 2007, an additional credit rating agency maintained its long-term rating for Mattel at Baa2, but changed its long-term outlook from negative to stable. Management does not expect these actions to have a significant impact on Mattels ability to obtain financing or to have a significant negative impact on Mattels liquidity or results of operations.  

Mattel believes its cash on hand at the beginning of 2008 and amounts available under its domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility and its foreign credit lines will be adequate to meet its seasonal financing requirements in 2008. As of December 31, 2007, Mattel had available incremental borrowing resources totaling approximately $850 million under its domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility and foreign credit lines.  

Mattel has a $300.0 million domestic receivables sales facility that is a sub-facility of Mattels domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility. The outstanding amount of receivables sold under the domestic receivables facility may not exceed $300.0 million at any given time, and the amount available to be borrowed under the credit facility is reduced to the extent of any such outstanding receivables sold. Under the domestic receivables facility, certain trade receivables are sold to a group of banks, which currently include, among others,   

41  

 Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Citicorp USA, Inc. and Barclays Bank PLC, as co-syndication agents, and Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, as co-documentation agents. Pursuant to the domestic receivables facility, Mattel Sales Corp. and Fisher-Price, Inc. (which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mattel) can sell eligible trade receivables from Wal-Mart and Target to Mattel Factoring, Inc. (Mattel Factoring), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of Mattel. Mattel Factoring is a special purpose entity whose activities are limited to purchasing and selling receivables under this facility. Pursuant to the terms of the domestic receivables facility and simultaneous with each receivables purchase, Mattel Factoring sells those receivables to the bank group. Mattel records the transaction, reflecting cash proceeds and sale of accounts receivable in its consolidated balance sheet, at the time of the sale of the receivables to the bank group.  

Sales of receivables pursuant to the domestic receivables sales facility occur periodically, generally quarterly. The receivables are sold by Mattel Sales Corp. and Fisher-Price, Inc. to Mattel Factoring for a purchase price equal to the nominal amount of the receivables sold. Mattel Factoring then sells such receivables to the bank group at a slight discount, and Mattel acts as a servicer for such receivables. Mattel has designated Mattel Sales Corp. and Fisher-Price, Inc. as sub-servicers, as permitted by the facility. Mattels appointment as a servicer is subject to termination events that are customary for such transactions. The domestic receivables sales facility is also subject to conditions to funding, representations and warranties, undertakings and early termination events that are customary for transactions of this nature. Mattel retains a servicing interest in the receivables sold under this facility.  

Until the Master Agreement was terminated on February 9, 2007, Mattel International Holdings B.V., a company incorporated in the Netherlands (the Depositor), Mattel France, a company incorporated in France (Mattel France), and Mattel GmbH, a company incorporated in Germany (Mattel Germany), each of which is a subsidiary of Mattel, and Societe Generale Bank Nederland N.V. (SGBN), were parties to a Master Agreement for the Transfer of Receivables that established a Euro 150 million European trade receivables facility (the European trade receivables facility), pursuant to which Mattel France and Mattel Germany sold trade receivables to SGBN. The European trade receivables facility was subject to conditions to funding, representations and warranties, undertakings and early termination events that were customary for transactions of this nature.  

Sales of receivables pursuant to the European trade receivables facility occurred monthly, with the last such sale occurring on January 10, 2007. The receivables were sold by Mattel France and Mattel Germany directly to SGBN for a purchase price equal to the nominal amount of the receivables sold. As a result, no Mattel subsidiary was used as a special purpose entity in connection with these transactions. A portion of the purchase price was funded by SGBN and a portion by a deposit provided by the Depositor. The amount of the deposit was reset on each date on which new receivables were sold. Through the termination date, the deposit in 2007 was, on average, equal to approximately 54% of the aggregate notional amount of sold receivables outstanding during such period.  

As with the domestic receivables facility, each sale of accounts receivable was recorded in Mattels consolidated balance sheet at the time of such sale. Under the European trade receivables facility, the outstanding amount of receivables sold could not exceed Euro 60 million from February 1 through July 31 of each year and could not exceed Euro 150 million at all other times.  

Each of Mattel France and Mattel Germany was appointed to service the receivables sold by it to SGBN. No servicing fees were paid by SGBN for such services. The appointment of each of Mattel France and Mattel Germany to act as servicer was subject to termination events that were customary for transactions of this nature.  

Mattel France and Mattel Germany were obligated to pay certain fees to the Depositor in consideration of the Depositor providing the deposit to SGBN. Through the termination date, fees paid in 2007 by Mattel France and Mattel Germany to the Depositor were, on average, approximately 0.1% of the aggregate notional amount of sold receivables outstanding during such period.  

42  

In November 2006, the commitment termination date for the European trade receivables facility was extended until February 28, 2007. However, effective on February 9, 2007, the Depositor, Mattel France and Mattel Germany terminated the European trade receivable facility with SGBN because the Company determined the facility was no longer necessary based on projected international cash flows and seasonal financing needs.  

The outstanding amounts of accounts receivable that were sold under these facilities and other factoring arrangements, net of collections from customers, have been excluded from Mattels consolidated balance sheets and are summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Financial Position  

Mattels cash and equivalents were $901.1 million at December 31, 2007, a decrease of $304.4 million from 2006. The decrease was primarily driven by share repurchases of $806.3 million, dividend payments of $272.3 million, the $50.0 million repayment of the MAPS revolving loan facility, $50.0 million repayment of Medium-term notes, the acquisition of Origin for $79.1 million, the purchase of rights to manufacture, distribute, and market several game properties for $25.3 million, and the purchase of a $35.0 million long-term investment security, partially offset by cash flows generated from operating activities of $560.5 million, short-term borrowings of $349.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $222.6 million. Accounts receivable increased by $47.4 million to $991.2 million at December 31, 2007, reflecting higher fourth quarter sales and lower factored receivables. Management expects to collect the majority of these receivables in the first quarter of 2008. Inventory levels increased by $45.6 million from 2006, primarily due to international growth along with longer lead times in importing goods into certain countries, and higher production costs. Based on its analysis of point of sale information for its top US customers, management believes that inventory levels of Mattel products at retail were somewhat higher at December 31, 2007 than the low levels of inventory that existed at December 31, 2006 and at the end of 2007 were more reflective of normalized levels.  

Short-term borrowings includes borrowings under the domestic unsecured committed credit facilities of $349.0 million. The current portion of long-term debt decreased $14.3 million to $50.0 million at December 31, 2007, as compared to December 31, 2006 due to the $50.0 million repayment of the MAPS term loan facility in January 2007, of which $14.3 million was classified as current at December 31, 2006. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $202.0 million from December 31, 2006 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007, mainly due to a decrease in amounts due bank related to the termination of the European receivables facility in 2007 and the timing and amount of payments of various accrued liability balances, including incentive compensation, royalties, and advertising obligations. The current portion of income taxes payable decreased from $161.9 million at year-end 2006 to $17.1 million at December 31, 2007, primarily due to the reclassification of tax reserves for which a cash tax payment is not expected to be made in the next twelve months to other noncurrent liabilities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. (FIN) 48.  

43  

A summary of Mattels capitalization is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total noncurrent long-term debt decreased $85.7 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006, due to the $50.0 million repayment of the MAPS term loan facility in January 2007, of which $35.7 million was classified as noncurrent at December 31, 2006, and the reclassification of $50.0 million of Medium-term notes to current portion of long-term debt. Mattel expects to satisfy its future long-term capital needs through the generation of earnings and issuance of long-term debt instruments. Stockholders equity of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007 decreased by $126.2 million from December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of share repurchases and payment of the annual dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of 2007, partially offset by net income and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  

Mattels debt-to-capital ratio, including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt, increased to 29.1% at December 31, 2007 from 22.3% at December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher short-term borrowings of $349.0 million, share repurchases, and the annual dividend payment, partially offset by net income, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, $50.0 million repayment of the MAPS term loan facility, and $50.0 million of Medium-term notes repayments. Mattels objective is to maintain a year-end debt-to-capital ratio of approximately 25%.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Mattel has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  

44  

Commitments  

In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into debt agreements, contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattels right to create and market certain products, and for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery. These arrangements include commitments for future inventory purchases and royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guaranteed or minimum expenditures during the term of the contracts.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Represents total obligation, including imputed interest of $1.3 million.   

In connection with the January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN 48, liabilities for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2007 totaling approximately $80 million for which a cash tax payment is not expected to be made in the next twelve months were reclassified from income taxes payable (within current liabilities) to other noncurrent liabilities. Due to the uncertainty about the periods in which examinations will be completed and limited information related to current audits, Mattel is not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods in which cash settlements will occur with taxing authorities for the noncurrent liabilities.  

Litigation  

The content of Note 10 (Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mattel in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety in this Item 7.  

Derivative Litigation  

Seven stockholder derivative actions have been filed, three in Los Angeles County Superior Court in California (Advantage Investors, G.P. v. Dolan et al., filed September 13, 2007; SEB Investment Management AB v. Eckert et al., filed September 14, 2007; and Catholic Medical Mission Board v. Eckert et al., filed September 19, 2007,), one in the Court of Chancery of Delaware (Sterling Heights Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. Eckert et al., filed October 10, 2007) and three in U.S. District Court, Central District of California (City of Philadelphia Bd. of Pensions v. Eckert et al., filed October 11, 2007, Retirement Board of Allegheny County etc. v. Beard, et al., filed October 26, 2007, and Asbestos Workers, Local 14 Pension Fund v. Eckert et al., filed October 30, 2007 (previously filed in state court)), each asserting claims ostensibly on behalf and for the benefit of Mattel. The derivative actions allege that past and present members of Mattels Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with product safety and reporting practices allegedly related to Mattels product recalls during August and September 2007. In SEB Investment, plaintiff also sues certain executive officers of Mattel, and also alleges waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment against all defendants. In Sterling Heights, plaintiff also alleges that certain current and former directors who sold stock during the first half of 2007 breached their fiduciary duties by selling while allegedly in possession of non-public information   

45  

 relating to alleged product defects and seek disgorgement of unspecified amounts of profits from such sales. The derivative plaintiffs have asked for damages in unspecified amounts and equitable relief. In Sterling Heights, defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, which is not yet fully briefed, and plaintiff has filed a motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice in favor of the California state derivative actions. The state and federal derivative actions in California have been consolidated into one action each in state and federal court, but all are in the preliminary stage with no responsive pleading yet filed.  

Effects of Inflation  

Inflation rates in the US and in major foreign countries where Mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during 2007, 2006, or 2005. The US Consumer Price Index increased 2.8% in 2007, 3.2% in 2006, and 3.4% in 2005. Mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability under certain circumstances at certain times to pass on higher prices to its customers.  

Employee Savings Plan  

Mattel sponsors a 401(k) savings plan, the Mattel Personal Investment Plan, for its domestic employees. Mattel makes employer contributions in cash and allows employees to allocate both their voluntary contributions and their employer automatic and matching contributions to a variety of investment funds, including a fund that is fully invested in Mattel common stock (the Mattel Stock Fund). Employees are not required to allocate any funds to the Mattel Stock Fund, which allows employees to limit or eliminate their exposure to market changes in Mattels stock price. Furthermore, the Mattel Personal Investment Plan limits an employees maximum allocation to the Mattel Stock Fund to a percentage of the employees total account balance, which is currently 25%. Employees may generally reallocate their account balances on a daily basis. The only limitation on the frequency of reallocations applies to changes involving the Mattel Stock Fund by employees classified as insiders or restricted personnel under Mattels insider trading policy. Pursuant to Mattels insider trading policy, insiders and restricted personnel are limited to certain periods in which they may make allocations into or out of the Mattel Stock Fund.  

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Mattel makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those Mattel considers most critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures included below. The following is a review of the accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. As described below, however, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used instead.  

Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of Mattels significant accounting policies, estimates, and methods used in the preparation of Mattels consolidated financial statements. In most instances, Mattel must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.  

Accounts ReceivableAllowance for Doubtful Accounts  

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop   

46  

 the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including other selling and administrative expenses, net income, and accounts receivable. In addition, the allowance requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors in relation to its customers ability to pay amounts owed to Mattel.  

Mattels products are sold throughout the world. Products within the Domestic segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets and, to a limited extent, wholesalers, and directly to consumers. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence.  

In recent years, the mass-market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. In addition, many of Mattels customers have been negatively impacted by worsening economic conditions. From 2001 through early 2004, four large customers of Mattel filed for bankruptcy. Mattels sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral and are highly concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to the cyclical nature of toy sales, which results in a substantial portion of trade receivables being collected during the latter half of the year and the first quarter of the following year. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of Mattel. This could increase Mattels exposure to losses from bad debts.  

A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattels net sales and accounts receivable. In 2007, Mattels three largest customers, Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, and Target, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 41% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 50% of net sales. As of December 31, 2007, Mattels three largest customers accounted for approximately 34% of net accounts receivable, and its ten largest customers accounted for approximately 45% of net accounts receivable. The concentration of Mattels business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattels large customers were to experience financial difficulty.  

Mattel has procedures to mitigate its risk of exposure to losses from bad debts. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or upon receipt of products by the customer, depending on the terms, provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an agreement exists documenting the specific terms of the transaction; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectibility must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer. Extensive evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of each customers financial performance, cash generation, financing availability and liquidity status. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews being performed, if necessary, based on the customers financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit. Customer terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the results of the review. Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, factoring or purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.  

The following table summarizes Mattels allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

47  

Mattels allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the business environment, customers financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts between December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflect managements assessment of the factors noted above, including past due accounts, disputed balances with customers, and the financial condition of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.  

Mattel believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2007 is adequate and proper. However, as described above, Mattels business is greatly dependent on a small number of customers. Should one or more of Mattels major customers experience liquidity problems, then the allowance for doubtful accounts of $21.5 million, or 2.1% of accounts receivable, at December 31, 2007 may not be sufficient to cover such losses. Any incremental bad debt charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattels business segments.  

InventoriesAllowance for Obsolescence  

Inventories, net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, net income and inventories. As more fully described below, valuation of Mattels inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences, demand for product, or changes in the buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and inventory management of customers.  

In the toy industry, orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment since actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line, which would require management to record a valuation allowance on such inventory.  

Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research and current market information. Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, who usually request delivery within three months. In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times cause risk to Mattels business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase inventory valuation risk since Mattels inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed.  

Additionally, current conditions in the domestic and global economies are uncertain. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts of the economy, including the economies in which Mattel participates. Because all components of Mattels budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets it serves and demand for its products, the prevailing economic uncertainties make estimates of future demand for product more difficult. Such economic changes may affect the sales of Mattels products and its corresponding inventory levels, which could potentially impact the valuation of its inventory.  

48  

At the end of each quarter, management within each business segment, Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, American Girl Brands and International, performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item-by-item basis and identifies products that are believed to be impaired. Management assesses the need for, and the amount of, an obsolescence reserve based on the following factors:  

       Customer and/or consumer demand for the item;  

       Overall inventory positions of Mattels customers;  

       Strength of competing products in the market;  

       Quantity on hand of the item;  

       Standard retail price of the item;  

       Mattels cost for the item; and  

       Length of time the item has been in inventory.  

The time frame between when an estimate is made and the time of disposal depends on the above factors and may vary significantly. Generally, slow-moving inventory is liquidated during the next annual selling cycle.  

The following table summarizes Mattels obsolescence reserve at December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in the allowance for obsolescence from 2006 to 2007 was mainly due to a higher level of excess inventory in 2007. The decrease in the allowance for obsolescence from 2005 to 2006 was mainly due to the 2006 liquidation of excess inventory. Management believes that its allowance for obsolescence at December 31, 2007 is adequate and proper. However, the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary. Any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattels business segments.  

Recoverability of Goodwill and Nonamortizable Intangible Assets  

SFAS No. 142 requires companies to test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the recoverability of its goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income, goodwill, and other intangible assets.  

The recoverability of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment since the first step of the impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value. Based on the assumptions underlying the valuation, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting units book value. If the fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is not recognized. If an impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.  

SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be allocated to various reporting units, which are either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below the operating segment, for purposes of evaluating whether   

49  

 goodwill is impaired. Mattels reporting units are: Mattel Girls Brands US, Mattel Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, American Girl Brands and International. Goodwill is allocated to Mattels reporting units based on an allocation of brand-specific goodwill to the reporting units selling those brands. Mattel utilizes the fair value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future (the Income Approach) when evaluating goodwill for impairment. The Income Approach valuation method requires Mattel to make projections of revenue, operating costs and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must make an estimate of its weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. Changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step in the SFAS No. 142 impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded. As of September 30, 2007, Mattel performed the annual impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142 and determined that its goodwill was not impaired since, for each of the reporting units, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount during 2007, 2006, and 2005. There were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment test should be performed again at December 31, 2007.  

Testing nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment also involves a high degree of judgment due to the assumptions that underlie the valuation. Mattel evaluates nonamortizable intangible assets, including trademarks and trade names, for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values. The fair value is measured using a multi-period royalty savings method, which reflects the savings realized by owning the trademarks and trade names, and thus not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party. As of September 30, 2007, Mattel performed the annual impairment test for nonamortizable intangible assets as required by SFAS No. 142 and determined that its nonamortizable intangible assets were not impaired. There were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment test should be performed again at December 31, 2007.  

Sales Adjustments  

Mattel routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized. Sales adjustments for such programs totaled $622.8 million, $507.9 million, and $444.5 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  

The above-described programs primarily involve fixed amounts or percentages of sales to customers. Accruals for such programs are calculated based on an assessment of customers purchases and performance under the programs and any other specified factors. While the majority of sales adjustment amounts are readily determinable at period end and do not require estimates, certain of the sales adjustments require management to make estimates. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends and information from customers. Management believes that the accruals recorded for customer programs at December 31, 2007 are adequate and proper.  

Product Recalls and Withdrawals  

Mattel establishes a reserve for product recalls and withdrawals on a product-specific basis when circumstances giving rise to the recall or withdrawal become known. Facts and circumstances related to the recall or withdrawal, including where the product affected by the recall or withdrawal is located (e.g., with consumers, in customers inventory, or in Mattels inventory), cost estimates for shipping and handling for returns, whether the product is repairable, cost estimates for communicating the recall or withdrawal to consumers and customers, and cost estimates for parts and labor if the recalled or withdrawn product is deemed to be repairable, are considered when establishing a product recall or withdrawal reserve. These factors are updated and reevaluated each period and the related reserves are adjusted when these factors indicate that the recall or withdrawal reserve is either not sufficient to cover or exceeds the estimated product recall or withdrawal expenses.  

50  

Significant changes in the assumptions used to develop estimates for product recall or withdrawal reserves could affect key financial measures, including accounts receivable, inventory, net sales, cost of sales, other selling and administrative expenses, and net income. In addition, estimating product recall or withdrawal reserves requires a high degree of judgment in areas such as estimating the portion of recalled or withdrawn products sold to end consumers and the portion held by retailers, return rates, shipping and handling for returns, the way in which affected products held by consumers may be remediated (e.g., through redeemable vouchers, or a repair kit being provided), and the costs of meeting regulatory requirements in various countries (e.g., public notification).  

The following table summarizes Mattels reserves and reserve activity for the 2007 Product Recalls:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mattel believes that its reserves for the 2007 Product Recalls at December 31, 2007 are adequate and proper. However, as described above, if the portions of inventory held at retailers and end consumers are different than estimated, return rates and shipping and handling for returns are higher than expected, or the costs of meeting regulatory requirements are higher than expected, then the reserves for the 2007 Product Recalls of $15.0 million at December 31, 2007 may not be sufficient to cover such losses.  

Benefit Plan Assumptions  

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, Mattel and certain of its subsidiaries have retirement and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees of these companies. Mattel accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and its other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 5 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsEmployee Benefit Plans.  

Actuarial valuations are used in determining amounts recognized in financial statements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans. These valuations incorporate the following significant assumptions:  

       Weighted average discount rate to be used to measure future plan obligations and interest cost component of plan income or expense;  

       Rate of future compensation increases (for defined benefit pension plans);  

       Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded plans); and  

       Health care cost trend rates (for other postretirement benefit plans).  

Management believes that these assumptions are critical accounting estimates because significant changes in these assumptions could impact Mattels results of operations and financial position. Management believes that the assumptions utilized to record its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on the plans experience and advice received from its outside actuaries. Mattel reviews its benefit plan assumptions annually and modifies its assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. The effects of such changes in assumptions are amortized as part of plan income or expense in future periods in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106 and 158.  

51  

At the end of each fiscal year, Mattel determines the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the benefit plan liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate also impacts the interest cost component of plan income or expense. At December 31, 2007, Mattel determined the discount rate for its domestic benefit plans to be 6.2% as compared to 5.7% and 5.4% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. In estimating this rate, Mattel reviews rates of return on high-quality, corporate bond indices, which approximate the timing and amount of benefit payments. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, the increase in the discount rate from 5.7% to 6.2% will result in a decrease in benefit plan expense during 2008 of approximately $1.5 million.  

The rate of future compensation increases used by Mattel for the benefit obligation of its domestic defined benefit pension plans averaged 3.8%, 4.0%, and 4.4% for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, based on plan demographics. The rate of future compensation increases used by Mattel for the net periodic pension cost of its domestic defined benefit pension plans averaged 4.0% for 2007 and 4.4% for 2006 and 2005, based on plan demographics. These assumptions are reviewed annually based on historical salary increases for participants in the defined benefit pension plans. This assumption impacts the service and interest cost components of plan income or expense.  

The long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on managements expectation of earnings on the assets that secure Mattels funded defined benefit pension plans, taking into account the mix of invested assets, the arithmetic average of past returns, economic and stock market conditions and future expectations and the long-term nature of the projected benefit obligation to which these investments relate. The long-term rate of return is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets that is used in calculating pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred, net of tax, and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income or expense. Mattels long-term rate of return for its domestic defined benefit pension plans was 8.0% in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2008 of approximately $3.0 million.  

The health care cost trend rates used by Mattel for its other postretirement benefit plans reflect managements best estimate of expected claim costs over the next ten years. These trend rates impact the service and interest cost components of plan expense. Rates ranging from 9.0% in 2007 to 5.0% in 2011, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2011 and thereafter, were used in determining plan expense for 2007. These rates are reviewed annually and are estimated based on historical costs for participants in the other postretirement benefit plans as well as estimates based on current economic conditions. As of December 31, 2007, Mattel adjusted the health care cost trend rates for its other postretirement benefit plans to range from 8.0% in 2007 reducing to 5.0% in 2011, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2011 and thereafter. Assuming all other postretirement benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefit plan expense during 2008 by approximately $0.7 million.  

A one percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each future year would impact the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007 by approximately $4.8 million and $(4.4) million, respectively, while a one percentage point increase/(decrease) would impact the service and interest cost recognized for 2007 by approximately $0.3 million and $(0.3) million, respectively.  

Share-Based Payments  

Prior to January 1, 2006, Mattel accounted for its employee stock compensation plans based on the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is only recognized in the statements of operations for employee stock options with exercise prices below the   

52  

 measurement date market price of the companys stock (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsShare-Based Payments). The amount of additional compensation expense that would have resulted if Mattel had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes.  

Effective January 1, 2006, Mattel adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payments, using the modified-prospective transition method. Accordingly, results for prior periods have not been restated and compensation cost in 2006 and 2007 includes the portion of share-based payment awards attributable to employee service during the applicable period for (i) grants made prior to January 1, 2006, based on the measurement date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) grants made subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the measurement date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).  

Beginning January 1, 2006 and in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Mattel recognizes the cost of all new employee share-based payment awards on a straight-line attribution basis over the requisite employee service period, net of estimated forfeitures; whereas, prior to January 1, 2006, Mattel used the graded vesting attribution method prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. In accounting for the income tax benefits associated with employee exercises of share-based payments, Mattel has elected to adopt the alternative simplified method as permitted by FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 123(R)-3, Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 permits the adoption of either the transition guidance described in SFAS No. 123(R) or the alternative simplified method specified in FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 to account for the income tax effects of share-based payment awards. In determining when additional tax benefits associated with share-based payment exercises are recognized, Mattel follows the ordering of deductions under the tax law, which allows deductions for share-based payment exercises to be utilized before previously existing net operating loss carryforwards. In computing dilutive shares under the treasury stock method, Mattel does not reduce the tax benefit amount within the calculation for the amount of deferred tax assets that would have been recognized had Mattel previously expensed all share-based payment awards.  

Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the measurement date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility, and the expected dividends. The fair value of options granted has been estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of the options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattels stock for a period approximating the expected life, the expected dividend yield is based on Mattels most recent actual annual dividend payout, and the risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. Management believes that these assumptions are critical accounting estimates because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income.  

The following weighted average assumptions were used in determining the fair value of options granted:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

53  

The following table summarizes the sensitivity of valuation assumptions within the calculation of stock option fair values, if all other assumptions are held constant:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On December 28, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Mattel approved the acceleration of vesting of options for approximately 12.4 million shares with an exercise price of $16.09 or greater granted to employees other than Mattels Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Options held by non-employee members of the Board of Directors were also excluded from the acceleration. The primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to avoid recognizing future compensation expense associated with the accelerated stock options upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006. Additionally, for financial reporting purposes, there were other potential tax benefits derived from accelerating the vesting of outstanding stock options prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Due to the acceleration of vesting in 2005, future share-based payment grants are expected to impact Mattels consolidated statements of operations more significantly than in the current period. For those future grants, different valuation assumptions, or actual forfeitures differing significantly from estimated forfeitures, could have a material effect on Mattels future financial statements.  

Mattel recognized compensation expense of $7.4 million and $23.9 million for stock options during 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a component of other selling and administrative expenses. Stock option expense in 2006 included $19.3 million related to prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors. Prior to January 1, 2006, no compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock options. Compensation expense recognized related to grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs) to certain employees and non-employee Board members was $14.8 million and $3.6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled $54.4 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  

Income Taxes  

Mattels income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual and expected future income, US and foreign statutory income tax rates, and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which Mattel operates. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the US and in foreign jurisdictions, evaluating Mattels worldwide uncertain tax positions, and assessing the likelihood of realizing certain tax benefits. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect Mattels consolidated financial statements.  

54  

Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. As a result, the tax expense reflected in Mattels consolidated statements of operations is different than that reported in Mattels tax returns filed with the taxing authorities. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in Mattels tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in Mattels tax returns in future years for which Mattel has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated statement of operations. Mattel records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Management evaluates the level of Mattels valuation allowances at least annually, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results.  

Effective January 1, 2007, Mattel adopted FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 excludes income taxes from the scope of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. FIN 48 also requires that amounts recognized in the balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions be classified as a current or noncurrent liability, based upon the expected timing of the payment to a taxing authority.  

Upon adoption of FIN 48, Mattel reclassified tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions for which a cash tax payment is not expected within the next twelve months to noncurrent liabilities. Mattels adoption of FIN 48 did not require a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of its retained earnings. Mattel classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.  

Mattel records unrecognized tax benefits for US federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions related primarily to transfer pricing, tax credits claimed, tax nexus and apportionment. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Mattels measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits is based on managements assessment of all relevant information, including prior audit experience, the status of current audits, conclusions of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, identification of new issues, and any administrative guidance or developments. Mattel recognizes unrecognized tax benefits in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits are more-likely-than-not of being realized.  

The 2007 income tax provision includes net benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million related to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes.  

In 2006, Mattel recognized total tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of ongoing audits with foreign and state tax authorities. Of the $63.0 million of total tax benefit recorded, $57.5 million represents refunds of previously paid taxes, which was recorded as an expense in previous years. Accordingly, these refunds were recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period the refunds were received by Mattel. The remainder of the tax benefit recorded in 2006 is a net reduction to total income tax reserves resulting from tax settlements with foreign and state tax authorities.  

In 2005, Mattel reduced its total income tax reserves by $38.6 million as a result of tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world.  

55  

In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. The ultimate settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattels consolidated financial statements.  

New Accounting Pronouncements  

SFAS No. 157  

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts. SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data, for example, the reporting entitys own data. Fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Mattel as of January 1, 2008. However, FSP FAS No. 157-2 delayed the adoption date until January 1, 2009 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Mattel does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on its operating results or financial position.  

SFAS No. 159  

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Mattel as of January 1, 2008. Mattel does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material effect on its operating results or financial position.  

SFAS No. 141(R)  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141(R) (i) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values, (ii) changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, (iii) requires contingent consideration to be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, requires changes in fair value to be recognized in earnings until settled, (iv) requires companies to revise any previously issued post-acquisition financial information to reflect any adjustments as if they had been recorded on the acquisition date, (v) requires the reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties to be recognized in earnings, and (vi) requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS 141(R) also requires additional disclosure of information surrounding a business combination to enhance financial statement users understanding of the nature and financial impact of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with the exception of

 accounting for changes in a valuation allowance for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions accounted for under FIN 48, which is effective on January 1, 2009 for all acquisitions. Mattel has not completed its evaluation of SFAS No. 141(R), but does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material effect on its operating results or financial position.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measure  

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mattel includes a non-GAAP financial measure, gross sales, which it uses to analyze its operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Net sales, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments and the 2007 Product Recalls. Consistent with its segment reporting, Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, business unit, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattels business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products.  

A reconciliation of gross sales to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net sales, is as follows:
