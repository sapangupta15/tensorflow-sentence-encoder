Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The following discussion also includes gross sales and currency exchange rate impact, non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Regulation G”), to supplement the financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. The currency exchange rate impact reflects the portion (expressed as a percentage) of changes in Mattel's reported results that are attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Mattel uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion, including a reconciliation of gross sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net sales, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Overview

Mattel is a creations company that inspires the wonder of childhood. Mattel’s objectives are to grow its share in the marketplace, continue to improve its operating margins, and create long-term stockholder value. To achieve these objectives, management has established the following strategies:

First, Mattel is focused on embracing brand building, creativity, and innovation, and management will put a premium on speed and personal accountability. Management is focused on putting Mattel back on track for growth and improved profitability.

Additionally, Mattel is organizing around the following five strategic priorities:

•Build powerful brand franchises;

•Establish Toy Box as the partner of choice;

•Develop unmatched commercial excellence;

•Drive continuous cost improvement; and

•Build emerging market leadership.

2016 Overview

Mattel’s 2016 results were negatively impacted by industry-wide challenges, including a significant US toy category slowdown in the holiday period, and increased foreign exchange headwinds. The slowdown in industry sales growth triggered elevated retail promotional activity and decreased shipping, which had a significant impact on gross margin. Despite this, Mattel experienced solid performance in its core brands and saw significant growth in key emerging markets such as China.

Mattel’s 2016 financial highlights include the following:

•Net sales in 2016 were $5.46 billion, a 4% decrease, as compared to 2015 net sales of $5.70 billion.

•Gross sales in 2016 were $6.07 billion, a 3% decrease, as compared to 2015 gross sales of $6.28 billion.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2017 and Beyond

Mattel remains optimistic about performance in 2017 and beyond with a very strong licensed entertainment slate complemented by continuing key core brand momentum. In addition, Mattel believes its investments in emerging and developing markets, content partnerships, and innovation will support growth in the business.

The following table provides a summary of Mattel’s consolidated gross sales by brand results for 2016 and 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross sales were $6.07 billion in 2016, a decrease of $209.9 million, or 3%, as compared to $6.28 billion in 2015, with an unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 3 percentage points. The decrease in gross sales was due to lower sales of Other Girls products, partially offset by higher sales of Entertainment products. Of the 52% decrease in Other Girls gross sales, 47% was due to lower sales of Disney Princess products. Of the 13% increase in Entertainment gross sales, 12% was due to higher sales of DC Comics products.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 53.2% in 2016, as compared to 50.8% in 2015. Cost of sales in 2016 was flat with 2015 at $2.90 billion, as compared to a 4% decrease in net sales. Within cost of sales, product and other costs increased by $52.4 million, or 2%, to $2.35 billion in 2016 from $2.30 billion in 2015; royalty expenses decreased $35.7 million, or 13%, to $228.9 million in 2016 from $264.6 million in 2015; and freight and logistics expenses decreased by $10.7 million, or 3%, to $322.7 million in 2016 from $333.4 million in 2015.

Gross Margin

Gross margin decreased to 46.8% in 2016 from 49.2% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, higher sales adjustments, and higher input costs, partially offset by strategic pricing and Funding Our Future savings.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses

Advertising and promotion expenses primarily consist of: (i) media costs, which primarily include the media, planning, and buying fees for television, print, and online advertisements, (ii) non-media costs, which primarily include commercial and website production, merchandising, and promotional costs, (iii) retail advertising costs, which primarily include consumer direct catalogs, newspaper inserts, fliers, and mailers, and (iv) generic advertising costs, which primarily include trade show costs. Advertising and promotion expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.6% in 2016 from 12.6% in 2015, primarily as a result of lower media and non-media costs.

24

Other Selling and Administrative Expenses

Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.40 billion, or 25.7% of net sales, in 2016, as compared to $1.55 billion, or 27.1% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in other selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to Funding Our Future net savings of approximately $60 million, lower incentive and equity compensation of approximately $36 million, and lower severance and restructuring charges of approximately $32 million.

Other Non-Operating Expense (Income), Net

Other non-operating expense was $23.5 million in 2016, as compared to other non-operating income of $1.1 million in 2015. The increase in other non-operating expense was primarily due to the change in the remeasurement rate used by Mattel's Venezuelan subsidiary, which resulted in an unrealized foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $26 million, in the first quarter of 2016.

Provision for Income Taxes

Mattel’s provision for income taxes was $91.7 million in 2016, compared to $94.5 million in 2015. Mattel's effective tax rate on income before income taxes in 2016 was 22.4%, as compared to 20.4% in 2015. The 2016 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $16.8 million primarily related to reassessments of prior years' tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, and the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The 2015 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $19.1 million primarily related to reassessments of prior years' tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes.

The decrease in gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of Other Girls and Barbie products, partially offset by higher sales of Wheels. Of the 26% decrease in Other Girls gross sales, 19% was due to lower sales of Monster High products and 4% was due to lower sales of Disney Princess products. The 10% decrease in Barbie gross sales was due to continued inventory overhang in certain European markets and increased competition within the doll category in certain international markets. Of the 10% increase in Wheels gross sales, 10% was due to higher sales of Hot Wheels products. 

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 50.8% in 2015, as compared to 50.2% in 2014. Cost of sales decreased by $126.5 million, or 4%, from $3.02 billion in 2014 to $2.90 billion in 2015, as compared to a 5% decrease in net sales.

Gross Margin

Gross margin decreased from 49.8% in 2014 to 49.2% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin was due to unfavorable foreign exchange, higher product-related costs, unfavorable product mix, and higher royalty expenses, partially offset by price increases and Funding Our Future savings.

The 2015 net tax benefits primarily relate to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes. The 2014 net tax benefits primarily relate to reassessments of prior year's tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, partially offset by a tax charge related to a 2014 tax restructuring for the HIT Entertainment and MEGA Brands operations.

Cost Savings Programs

During 2013, Mattel initiated Operational Excellence 3.0, which targeted cumulative gross cost savings of approximately $175 million by the end of 2014. Mattel exceeded its Operational Excellence 3.0 goal by realizing approximately $179 million of cumulative gross cost savings throughout the program. 

During 2014, Mattel realized gross cost savings before severance charges and investments of approximately $119 million (or approximately $74 million in net cost savings). Of the gross cost savings realized in 2014, approximately $77 million was reflected within gross profit, approximately $35 million within other selling and administrative expenses, and approximately $7 million within advertising and promotion expenses.

During 2015, Mattel initiated the next phase of its cost savings program, Funding Our Future, which targeted additional cumulative gross cost savings of approximately $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2016. Mattel achieved cumulative gross cost savings of approximately $295 million, which was at the high end of its Funding Our Future goal. The cost savings program was designed to generate cost savings through various initiatives, including structural and process improvements and supply chain optimization.

During 2015, Mattel realized gross cost savings before severance charges and investments of approximately $153 million (or approximately $92 million in net cost savings). Of the gross cost savings realized in 2015, approximately $70 million was reflected within gross profit, approximately $73 million within other selling and administrative expenses, and approximately $10 million within advertising and promotion expenses.

Income Taxes

Mattel’s effective tax rate on income before income taxes in 2016 was 22.4%, as compared to 20.4% in 2015. The 2016 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $16.8 million, primarily related to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, and the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement.

Mattel’s effective tax rate on income before income taxes in 2015 and 2014 was 20.4% and 15.0%, respectively. The 2015 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $19.1 million, primarily related to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes.

The 2014 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $42.6 million, primarily related to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, partially offset by a tax charge related to a 2014 tax restructuring for the HIT Entertainment and MEGA Brands operations.

In the first quarter of 2016, Mattel retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which generally simplifies the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, into noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $195.8 million, other noncurrent assets increased by $193.6 million, and other noncurrent liabilities decreased by $2.2 million from the previously reported amounts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Mattel’s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and equivalents balances, access to short-term borrowing facilities, including its $1.60 billion domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), and issuances of long-term debt securities. Cash flows from operating activities could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for Mattel’s products, which could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions and changes in public and consumer preferences, or by increased costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of products or shortages in raw materials or component parts. Additionally, Mattel’s ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as global economic crises and tight credit environments, an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements, which include maintaining consolidated debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and interest coverage ratios, or a deterioration of Mattel’s credit ratings. Mattel’s ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity.

Of Mattel’s $869.5 million in cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2016, approximately $683 million is held by foreign subsidiaries. Mattel may need to accrue and pay additional income taxes if some or all of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were repatriated. Mattel does not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Mattel has several liquidity options to fund its domestic operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends, share repurchases, and debt service. Positive cash flows generated annually by its domestic operations, the Credit Facility, and access to both long-term and short-term public and private debt markets at highly competitive interest rates are available to fund domestic operations and obligations. If these sources are not adequate, Mattel also has the ability to repatriate highly taxed foreign earnings, receive repayment of intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries, and distribute liquidating dividends from foreign subsidiaries, all of which would have a very nominal impact, if any, on Mattel’s tax liabilities. Mattel believes that its policy to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries will not result in and is not reasonably likely to result in a material change to Mattel’s liquidity position.

Current Market Conditions

Mattel is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. Mattel believes that it has ample liquidity to fund its business needs, including beginning of year cash and equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to the commercial paper markets and its Credit Facility, which it uses for seasonal working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2016, Mattel had available incremental borrowing resources totaling $1.46 billion under the Credit Facility, and Mattel has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access this source of liquidity. Market conditions could affect certain terms of other debt instruments that Mattel enters into from time to time.

33

Mattel monitors the third-party depository institutions that hold the Company’s cash and equivalents. Mattel’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal, and secondarily on maximizing the yield on those funds. Mattel diversifies its cash and equivalents among counterparties and securities to minimize risks.

Mattel is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of its counterparties in hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations. The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the fair value measurements of Mattel’s foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Mattel closely monitors its counterparties and takes action, as necessary, to manage its counterparty credit risk.

Mattel expects that some of its customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials. Mattel monitors its customers’ financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate Mattel’s accounts receivable collectibility risks, and customer terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary. Additionally, Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, factoring, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.

Mattel sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for its employees. Actual returns below the expected rate of return, along with changes in interest rates that affect the measurement of the liability, would impact the amount and timing of Mattel’s future contributions to these plans.

Capital and Investment Framework

To guide future capital deployment decisions, with a goal of maximizing stockholder value, Mattel’s Board of Directors established the following capital and investment framework:

•To maintain approximately $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash available to fund a substantial portion of seasonal working capital;

•To maintain a year-end debt-to-capital ratio of about 35%;

•To invest approximately $180 million to $200 million in capital expenditures annually to maintain and grow the business;

•To make strategic opportunistic acquisitions; and

•To return excess funds to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Over the long term, assuming annual cash flows from operating activities remain strong, Mattel plans to use its free cash flows to invest in strategic acquisitions and to return funds to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. Mattel’s share repurchase program has no expiration date and repurchases will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. The ability to successfully implement the capital deployment plan is directly dependent on Mattel’s ability to generate strong annual cash flows from operating activities. There is no assurance that Mattel will continue to generate strong annual cash flows from operating activities or achieve its targeted goals for investing activities.

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities were $594.5 million during 2016, as compared to $734.6 million during 2015 and $888.6 million during 2014. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to higher working capital usage and lower net income. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to higher working capital usage and lower net income. 

Investing Activities

Cash flows used for investing activities were $311.9 million during 2016, as compared to $282.5 million during 2015 and $708.6 million during 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling in 2016. The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of MEGA Brands in 2014.

34

Financing Activities

Cash flows used for financing activities were $281.5 million during 2016, as compared to $500.2 million during 2015 and $227.3 million during 2014. The decrease in cash flows used for financing activities in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to the $350.0 million issuance of senior notes in the third quarter of 2016 and higher short-term borrowings, partially offset by the $300.0 million repayment of maturing senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in cash flows used for financing activities in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to prior year net proceeds from long-term borrowings and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by lower share repurchases.

During 2016 and 2015, Mattel did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During 2014, Mattel repurchased 4.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $177.2 million. Mattel's share repurchase program was first announced on July 21, 2003. On July 17, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized Mattel to increase its share repurchase program by $500.0 million. At December 31, 2016, share repurchase authorizations of $203.0 million had not been executed. Repurchases under the program will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. Mattel's share repurchase program has no expiration date. 

During 2016, 2015, and 2014, Mattel paid total dividends per share of $1.52, in each year, to holders of its common stock. The Board of Directors declared the dividends on a quarterly basis, and Mattel paid the dividends during the quarters in which the dividends were declared. The payment of dividends on common stock is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and is subject to customary limitations. Dividend payments were $518.5 million, $515.1 million, and $514.8 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

Seasonal Financing

See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Seasonal Financing and Debt.”

Financial Position

Mattel’s cash and equivalents decreased $23.3 million to $869.5 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to $892.8 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to dividend payments, purchases of tools, dies, and molds and other property, plant, and equipment, and the acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds from short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

Accounts receivable decreased $29.9 million to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2016, as compared to $1.15 billion at December 31, 2015. Inventory increased $26.3 million to $613.8 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to $587.5 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to accelerated customer payments, partially offset by higher American Girl receivables as a result of external distribution and a shift in sales to countries with longer payment terms. The increase in inventory was primarily due to higher inventory to meet expected future demands and higher American Girl production for external distribution.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $16.2 million to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2016, as compared to $1.31 billion at December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation, accrued severance, and royalties, partially offset by tight management of vendor disbursements.

As of December 31, 2016, Mattel had short-term borrowings outstanding of $192.2 million, including $47.2 million of foreign short-term borrowings and $145.0 million of domestic short-term borrowings, which was $175.3 million higher than December 31, 2015. 

35

A summary of Mattel’s capitalization is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noncurrent long-term debt increased by approximately $350 million from December 31, 2015 to $2.13 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily due to issuance of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2021 ("2016 Senior Notes").

Stockholders’ equity decreased $225.5 million from December 31, 2015 to $2.41 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily due to dividend payments and currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net income.

Mattel’s debt-to-total capital ratio, including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt, increased from 44.4% at December 31, 2015 to 49.1% at December 31, 2016 as a result of higher short-term borrowings and lower stockholders’ equity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Mattel has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into debt agreements and contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattel’s right to create and market certain products and for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery. These arrangements include commitments for future inventory and service purchases and royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the terms of the contracts. Mattel also has defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans, which require future cash contributions and benefit payments. Additionally, Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for premises and equipment used, which contain minimum rental payments.

36

The following table summarizes Mattel’s contractual commitments and obligations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Represents total obligation, including imputed interest of $0.1 million.

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which a cash tax payment is not expected to be made in the next twelve months are classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Due to the uncertainty about the periods in which examinations will be completed and limited information related to current audits, Mattel is not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods in which cash settlements will occur with taxing authorities for the noncurrent liabilities.

Subsequent Event

On January 25, 2017, Mattel announced that its Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per common share. The dividend is payable on March 3, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 16, 2017.

Litigation

The content of Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation” is hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 7.

Effects of Inflation

Inflation rates in the US and in major foreign countries where Mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during 2016, 2015, or 2014. Mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability, under certain circumstances and at certain times, to pass on higher prices to its customers.

Employee Savings Plan

Mattel sponsors a 401(k) savings plan, the Mattel, Inc. Personal Investment Plan (the “Plan”), for its domestic employees. Contributions to the Plan include voluntary contributions by eligible employees and employer automatic and matching contributions by Mattel. The Plan allows employees to allocate both their voluntary contributions and their employer automatic and matching contributions to a variety of investment funds, including a fund that is invested in Mattel common stock (the “Mattel Stock Fund”). Employees are not required to allocate any of their Plan account balance to the Mattel Stock Fund, allowing employees to limit or eliminate their exposure to market changes in Mattel’s stock price. Furthermore, the Plan limits the percentage of the employee’s total account balance that may be allocated to the Mattel Stock Fund to 25%. Employees may generally reallocate their account balances on a daily basis. However, pursuant to Mattel’s insider trading policy, employees classified as insiders and restricted personnel under Mattel’s insider trading policy are limited to certain periods in which they may make allocations into or out of the Mattel Stock Fund.

37

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Mattel makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those Mattel considers most critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures included below. These accounting policies and estimates include significant judgments made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. As described below, however, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used instead.

For a summary of Mattel’s significant accounting policies, estimates, and methods used in the preparation of Mattel’s consolidated financial statements, see Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” In most instances, Mattel must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).

Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a “critical accounting estimate” because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including other selling and administrative expenses, net income, and accounts receivable. In addition, the allowance requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors in relation to its customers’ ability to pay amounts owed to Mattel.

Mattel’s products are sold throughout the world. Products within the North America segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets and, to a limited extent, wholesalers, and directly to consumers. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence.

In recent years, the mass-market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. Mattel’s sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral and are highly concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to the seasonal nature of toy sales, which results in a substantial portion of trade receivables being collected during the latter half of the year and the first quarter of the following year. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of Mattel. This could increase Mattel’s exposure to losses from bad debts.

A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattel’s net sales and accounts receivable. In 2016, Mattel’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us, and Target, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 39% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 49% of net sales. As of December 31, 2016, Mattel’s three largest customers accounted for approximately 35% of net accounts receivable, and its ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of net accounts receivable. The concentration of Mattel’s business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattel’s large customers were to experience financial difficulty.

Mattel has procedures to mitigate its risk of exposure to losses from bad debts. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or upon receipt of products by the customer, depending on the terms, provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an agreement exists documenting the specific terms of the transaction; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Value added taxes are recorded on a net basis and are excluded from revenue. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectibility must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer. Extensive evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of each customer’s financial performance, cash generation, financing availability, and liquidity status. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews being performed, if necessary, based on the customers’ financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit. Customers’ terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the results of the review. Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, factoring, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.

38

The following table summarizes Mattel’s allowance for doubtful accounts:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mattel’s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the business environment, customers’ financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts reflect management’s assessment of the factors noted above, including past due accounts, disputed balances with customers, and the financial condition of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.

Mattel believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2016 is adequate and proper. However, as described above, Mattel’s business is greatly dependent on a small number of customers. Should one or more of Mattel’s major customers experience liquidity problems, then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to cover such losses. Any incremental bad debt charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattel’s business segments.

Inventories—Allowance for Obsolescence

Inventories, net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess, and slow-moving inventory. Inventory allowances are charged to cost of sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for obsolescence is a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, net income, and inventories. As more fully described below, valuation of Mattel’s inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences, demand for product, or changes in the buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and inventory management of customers.

In the toy industry, orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment since actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line, which would require management to record a valuation adjustment on such inventory.

Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, who usually request delivery within three months. In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattel’s business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase inventory valuation risk since Mattel’s inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed.

When current conditions in the domestic and global economies become uncertain, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts of the economy, including the economies in which Mattel participates. Because all components of Mattel’s budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets it serves and demand for its products, economic uncertainty makes estimates of future demand for product more difficult. Such economic changes may affect the sales of Mattel’s products and its corresponding inventory levels, which could potentially impact the valuation of its inventory.

39

At the end of each quarter, management within each business segment, North America, International, and American Girl, performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item-by-item basis and identifies products that are believed to be impaired. Management assesses the need for, and the amount of, an obsolescence reserve based on the following factors: 

•Customer and/or consumer demand for the item;

•Overall inventory positions of Mattel’s customers;

•Strength of competing products in the market;

•Quantity on hand of the item;

•Sales price of the item;

•Mattel’s cost for the item; and

•Length of time the item has been in inventory.

The timeframe between when an estimate is made and the time of disposal depends on the above factors and may vary significantly. Generally, slow-moving inventory is liquidated during the next annual selling cycle.

The following table summarizes Mattel’s obsolescence reserve:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management believes that its allowance for obsolescence at December 31, 2016 is adequate and proper. However, the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary. Any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattel’s business segments.

Goodwill and Nonamortizable Intangible Assets

Mattel tests goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. Management believes that the accounting estimates related to the fair value estimates of its goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets are “critical accounting estimates” because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income, goodwill, and other intangible assets.

Assessing goodwill for impairment involves a high degree of judgment due to the assumptions that underlie the valuation. For purposes of evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at the operating segment level. Mattel’s reporting units are: (i) North America, (ii) International, and (iii) American Girl. Mattel then assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. When the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is necessary, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit’s book value. If the fair value is greater than the book value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If an impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.

When performing the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test, Mattel utilizes the fair value based upon the discounted cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future (the “Income Approach”). The Income Approach valuation method requires Mattel to make projections of revenue, operating costs, and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must make an estimate of a weighted average cost of capital that a market participant would use as a discount rate. Changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step of the impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded.

40

During the third quarter of 2016, Mattel assessed its goodwill for impairment by performing the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Mattel determined that its goodwill was not impaired since, for each of the reporting units, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 

Testing nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment also involves a high degree of judgment due to the assumptions that underlie the valuation. Mattel evaluates nonamortizable intangible assets, including trademarks and trade names, for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values. The fair value is measured using a multi-period excess earnings method, which reflects the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the trademark and trade names after deducting the appropriate contributory asset charges.

During the third quarter of 2016, Mattel performed the annual impairment test for the remaining nonamortizable intangible assets as required and determined that its remaining nonamortizable intangible assets were not impaired as the fair values of the nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded their carrying values. Mattel also considered events and circumstances subsequent to these impairment tests in concluding there was no impairment as of December 31, 2016.

Sales Adjustments

Mattel routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized. Sales adjustments for such programs totaled $617.0 million, $581.0 million, and $694.6 million during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

The above-described programs primarily involve fixed amounts or percentages of sales to customers. Accruals for such programs are calculated based on an assessment of customers’ purchases and performance under the programs and any other specified factors. While the majority of sales adjustment amounts are readily determinable at period end and do not require estimates, certain of the sales adjustments require management to make estimates. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends, and information from customers. Management believes that the accruals recorded for customer programs as of December 31, 2016 are adequate and proper.

Benefit Plan Assumptions

Mattel and certain of its subsidiaries have retirement and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees of these companies. See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Employee Benefit Plans.”

Actuarial valuations are used in determining amounts recognized in the financial statements for certain retirement and other postretirement benefit plans. These valuations incorporate the following significant assumptions: 

•Weighted average discount rate to be used to measure future plan obligations and interest cost component of plan income or expense;

•Rate of future compensation increases (for defined benefit pension plans);

•Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded plans); and

•Health care cost trend rates (for other postretirement benefit plans).

Management believes that these assumptions are “critical accounting estimates” because significant changes in these assumptions could impact Mattel’s results of operations and financial position. Management believes that the assumptions utilized to record its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on the plans’ experience and advice received from its outside actuaries. Mattel reviews its benefit plan assumptions annually and modifies its assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. The effects of such changes in assumptions are amortized as part of plan income or expense in future periods.

41

At the end of each fiscal year, Mattel determines the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the benefit plan liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate also impacts the interest cost component of plan income or expense. As of December 31, 2016, Mattel determined the discount rate for its domestic benefit plans used in determining the projected and accumulated benefit obligations to be 3.9%, as compared to 4.2% and 3.8% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In estimating this rate, Mattel reviews rates of return on high-quality corporate bond indices, which approximate the timing and amount of benefit payments. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, the decrease in the discount rate from 4.2% to 3.9% would result in a decrease in benefit plan expense during 2017 of $0.3 million.

As a result of the curtailment of Mattel's domestic defined benefit pension plans, the rate of future compensation increase was not applicable for the 2016 benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost calculations. The rate of future compensation increases used by Mattel for the benefit obligation and the net periodic pension cost of its domestic defined benefit pension plans averaged 3.8% for 2015 and 2014, based on plan demographics. This assumption is reviewed annually based on historical salary increases for participants in the defined benefit pension plans and impacts the service and interest cost components of plan income or expense.

The long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on management’s expectation of earnings on the assets that secure Mattel’s funded defined benefit pension plans, taking into account the mix of invested assets, the arithmetic average of past returns, economic and stock market conditions and future expectations, and the long-term nature of the projected benefit obligation to which these investments relate. The long-term rate of return is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets that is used in calculating pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred, net of tax, and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income or expense. Mattel’s long-term rate of return used in determining plan expense for its domestic defined benefit pension plans was 6.5% in 2016, as compared to 7.5% during the first half of 2015 and revised to 6.8% for the second half of 2015, and 8.0% in 2014. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2017 of $3.4 million.

The health care cost trend rates used by Mattel for its other postretirement benefit plans reflect management’s best estimate of expected claim costs over the next ten years. These trend rates impact the service and interest cost components of plan expense. Rates ranging from 8.3% in 2016 to 4.5% in 2024, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2023 for participants younger than age 65 and 2024 for participants age 65 and older, were used in determining plan expense for 2016. These rates are reviewed annually and are estimated based on historical costs for participants in the other postretirement benefit plans as well as estimates based on current economic conditions. As of December 31, 2016, Mattel maintained the health care cost trend rates for its other postretirement benefit plan obligation at 7.0% for participants younger than age 65 and 7.8% for participants age 65 and older. For participants younger than age 65, the cost trend rates are estimated to reduce to 4.5% by 2024, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2024. For participants age 65 and older, the cost trend rates are estimated to reduce to 4.5% by 2024, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2024. Assuming all other postretirement benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2017 of $0.1 million.

A one percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each future year would impact the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 by $2.1 million and $(1.9) million, respectively, and the service and interest cost recognized for 2016 by $0.1 million and $(0.1) million, respectively.

Share-Based Payments

Mattel recognizes the cost of employee share-based payment awards on a straight-line attribution basis over the requisite employee service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the measurement date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility, and the expected dividends. Mattel estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of the options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattel’s stock for a period approximating the expected life, the expected dividend yield is based on Mattel’s most recent actual annual dividend payout, and the risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. Management believes that these assumptions are “critical accounting estimates” because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income.

42

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $4.09, $1.97, and $4.57, respectively. The following weighted average assumptions were used in determining the fair value of options granted:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following tables summarizes the sensitivity of valuation assumptions within the calculation of stock option fair values, if all other assumptions are held constant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mattel recognized compensation expense of $10.5 million, $15.2 million, and $12.5 million for stock options during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which is included within other selling and administrative expenses. Compensation expense recognized related to grants of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), including performance-based restricted stock units (“Performance RSUs”), was $43.4 million, $41.5 million, and $39.5 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and is also included within other selling and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2016, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled $85.1 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

Income Taxes 

Mattel’s income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual and expected future income, US and foreign statutory income tax rates, and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which Mattel operates. Management believes that the accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the US and in foreign jurisdictions, evaluating Mattel’s worldwide uncertain tax positions, and assessing the likelihood of realizing certain tax benefits. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect Mattel’s consolidated financial statements. 

Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in Mattel’s consolidated statements of operations is different than that reported in Mattel’s tax returns filed with the taxing authorities. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in Mattel’s tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in Mattel’s tax returns in future years for which Mattel has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated statement of operations. Mattel records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Management evaluates the level of Mattel’s valuation allowances at least annually, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. 

43

Mattel records unrecognized tax benefits for US federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions related primarily to transfer pricing, tax credits claimed, tax nexus, and apportionment. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Mattel’s measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits is based on management’s assessment of all relevant information, including prior audit experience, the status of audits, conclusions of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, identification of new issues, and any administrative guidance or developments. Mattel recognizes unrecognized tax benefits in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits will more-likely-than-not (a greater than 50 percent likelihood) be realized. 

Mattel’s effective tax rate on income before income taxes in 2016 was 22.4%, as compared to 20.4% in 2015. The income tax provision included net tax benefits of $16.8 million, $19.1 million, and $42.6 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The 2016 net tax benefits primarily relate to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, and the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The 2015 net tax benefits primarily relate to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes. The 2014 net tax benefits primarily related to the reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, partially offset by a tax charge related to a 2014 tax restructuring for the HIT Entertainment and MEGA Brands operations. 

In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. The ultimate settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattel’s consolidated financial statements. 

New Accounting Pronouncements

See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Mattel presents certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mattel uses these metrics to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance, and each is discussed in detail below. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures by other companies.

Currency Exchange Rate Impact

The currency exchange rate impact reflects the portion (expressed as a percentage) of changes in Mattel's reported results that are attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

For entities reporting in currencies other than the US dollar, Mattel calculates the percentage change of period-over-period results at constant currency exchange rates (established as described below) by translating current period and prior period results using these rates. It then determines the currency exchange rate impact percentage by calculating the difference between the percentage change at such constant currency exchange rates and the percentage change at actual exchange rates.

Mattel established the exchange rates that it uses for these constant currency calculations years ago. It considers whether any changes to these rates are appropriate at the beginning of each year but, generally, has held them unchanged.

Gross Sales

Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Net sales, as reported, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, brand, and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel’s business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the details of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with brands or individual products, making net sales less meaningful. Because sales adjustments are not allocated to individual products, net sales are only presented on a consolidated and segment basis and not on a brand level.
