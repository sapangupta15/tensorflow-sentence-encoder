Regulated Utilities

SCE&G is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 678,000 customers and the purchase, sale and transportation of natural gas to approximately 329,000 customers (each as of December 31, 2013). SCE&G’s business experiences seasonal fluctuations, with generally higher sales of electricity during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and generally higher sales of natural gas during the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&G’s electric service territory extends into 24 counties covering nearly 17,000 square miles in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 35 counties in South Carolina and covers approximately 22,600 square miles. More than 3.2 million persons live in the counties where SCE&G conducts its business. Resale customers include municipalities, electric cooperatives, other investor-owned utilities, registered marketers and federal and state electric agencies. Predominant industries served by SCE&G include chemicals, educational services, paper products, food products, lumber and wood products, health services, textile manufacturing, rubber and miscellaneous plastic products and fabricated metal products.

PSNC Energy purchases, sells and transports natural gas to approximately 509,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers (as of December 31, 2013). PSNC Energy serves 28 franchised counties covering 12,000 square miles in North Carolina. The predominant industries served by PSNC Energy include educational services, food products, health services, automotive, chemicals, non-woven textiles, electrical generation and construction.

CGT operates as an open access, transportation-only interstate pipeline company regulated by FERC. CGT operates in southeastern Georgia and in South Carolina and has interconnections with Southern Natural at Port Wentworth, Georgia and with Southern LNG, Inc. at Elba Island, near Savannah, Georgia. CGT also has interconnections with Southern Natural in Aiken County, South Carolina, and with Transco in Cherokee and Spartanburg counties, South Carolina. CGT’s customers include SCE&G (which uses natural gas for electricity generation and for gas distribution to retail customers), SEMI (which markets natural gas to industrial and sale for resale customers, primarily in the Southeast), municipalities, county gas authorities, federal and state agencies, marketers, power generators and industrial customers primarily engaged in the manufacturing or processing of ceramics, paper, metal, and textiles.

Nonregulated Businesses

SEMI markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy-related risk management services. SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, sells natural gas to approximately 454,000 customers (as of December 31, 2013, and includes approximately 68,000 customers in its regulated division) in Georgia’s natural gas market. In third quarter 2013, SCANA Energy’s contract to serve as Georgia’s regulated provider of natural gas was renewed by the GPSC through August 31, 2015. SCANA Energy’s total customer base represents an approximately 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgia’s deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in Georgia.

SCI owns and operates a 1,125 mile fiber optic telecommunications network and ethernet network and data center facilities in South Carolina. Through a joint venture, SCI has an interest in an additional 2,280 miles of fiber in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. SCI also provides tower site construction, management and rental services and sells towers in South Carolina and North Carolina. SCI leases fiber optic capacity, data center space and tower space to certain affiliates at market rates.

The preceding Corporate Structure and Organization section describes other regulated and nonregulated businesses owned by SCANA.

COMPETITION

For a discussion of the impact of competition, see the Overview section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

SCANA’s regulated subsidiaries, including SCE&G, require cash to fund operations, construction programs and dividend payments to SCANA. SCANA’s nonregulated subsidiaries require cash to fund operations and dividend payments to SCANA. To replace existing plant investment and to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, SCANA’s regulated subsidiaries must attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their construction programs, rate increases will be sought. 

6

The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, when requested.

For a discussion of various rate matters and their impact on capital requirements, see the Regulatory Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

During the period 2014-2016, SCANA and SCE&G expect to meet capital requirements through internally generated funds, issuance of equity and short-term and long-term borrowings. SCANA and SCE&G expect that they have or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet their projected cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.

For a discussion of cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures, contractual cash obligations, financing limits, financing transactions and other related information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

Ratios of earnings to fixed charges for each of the five years ended December 31, 2013, were as follows:

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Electric Sales

SCE&G’s sales of electricity and margins earned from the sale of electricity by customer classification as percentages of electric revenues for 2012 and 2013 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for resale include sales to three municipalities and one electric cooperative. Short-term system sales were not significant for any period presented.

During 2013 SCE&G experienced a net increase of approximately 8,000 electric customers (growth rate of 1.2%), increasing its total electric customers to approximately 678,000 at year end.

For the period 2014-2016, SCE&G projects total territorial kWh sales of electricity to increase 0.6% annually (assuming normal weather), total retail sales growth of 0.6% annually (assuming normal weather), total electric customer base to increase 1.8% annually and territorial peak load (summer, in MW) to increase 1.9% annually. SCE&G projects a retail kWh sales decrease of approximately 0.2% and customer growth of 1.1% from 2013 to 2014. SCE&G’s goal is to maintain a planning reserve margin of between 14% and 20%, however, weather and other factors affect territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any given day to fall below the reserve margin goal. 

Electric Interconnections

SCE&G purchases all of the electric generation of GENCO’s Williams Station under a Unit Power Sales Agreement which has been approved by FERC. Williams Station has a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 605 MW.

7

SCE&G’s transmission system, which extends over a large part of the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina, interconnects with Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, Duke Energy Progress, Inc., Santee Cooper, Georgia Power Company and the Southeastern Power Administration’s Clarks Hill (Thurmond) Project. SCE&G is a member of VACAR, one of several geographic divisions within the SERC. SERC is one of eight regional entities with delegated authority from NERC for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards approved by FERC. SERC is divided geographically into five diverse sub-regions that are identified as Central, Delta, Gateway, Southeastern and VACAR. The regional entities and all members of NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America. For a discussion of the impact certain legislative and regulatory initiatives may have on SCE&G’s transmission system, see Electric Operations within the Overview section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

Fuel Costs and Fuel Supply

The average cost of various fuels and the weighted average cost of all fuels (including oil) for the years 2011-2013 follow:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The sources and percentages of total MWh generation by each category of fuel for the years 2011-2013 and the estimates for the years 2014-2016 follow: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2013, the Company used coal to generate electricity at six fossil fuel-fired plants, including its cogeneration facility located in Charleston, South Carolina. Unit trains and, in some cases, trucks and barges delivered coal to these plants. SCE&G completed the retirement of one of these plants (comprised of three units) in 2012 and 2013 and intends to retire certain other coal-fired generating units by 2018, subject to future developments in environmental regulations, among other matters. One of the units to be retired by 2018 was fueled with coal prior to 2013, but is expected to be fueled exclusively with natural gas until its retirement.

Coal is primarily obtained through long-term supply contracts. Long-term contracts exist with suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 2.8 million tons annually. Sulfur restrictions on the contract coal range from 1.0% to 1.6%. These contracts expire at various times through 2016. Spot market purchases may occur when needed or when prices are believed to be favorable.

SCANA and SCE&G believe that SCE&G’s operations comply with all applicable regulations relating to the discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. See additional discussion at Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse are parties to a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, SCE&G has to supply enriched product to Westinghouse and Westinghouse will supply nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&G’s exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. 

The Consortium currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Summer Station Unit 1 under a services alliance agreement. Although SCE&G has provided the Consortium with notice of its election to terminate the existing agreement, it is anticipated that SCE&G will enter into new agreements to provide similar support services to Summer Station Unit 1 and to the New Units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation. Those new agreements may, but will not necessarily, be between SCE&G and the Consortium.

In addition, SCE&G has contracts covering its nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services and enrichment services. These contracts have varying expiration dates through 2024. SCE&G believes that it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services and that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment of normal operations of its nuclear generating units.

SCE&G can store spent nuclear fuel on-site until at least 2017 and has commenced construction of a dry cask storage facility to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Summer Station Unit 1. SCE&G may evaluate other technology as it becomes available. In addition, Summer Station Unit 1 has sufficient on-site storage capacity to permit storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete unloading should become desirable or necessary. For information about the contract with the DOE regarding disposal of spent fuel, see Hazardous and Solid Wastes within the Environmental Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

GAS OPERATIONS

Gas Sales-Regulated

Regulated sales of natural gas by customer classification as a percent of total regulated gas revenues sold or transported for 2012 and 2013 were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the three-year period 2014-2016, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in MMBTUs to increase 1.4% annually (excluding transportation and assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in MMBTU sales include residential of 2.1%, commercial of 0.8% and industrial of 0.8%.

For the three-year period 2014-2016, SCE&G projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in MMBTUs to increase 0.8% annually (excluding transportation and assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in MMBTU sales include residential of 1.0%, commercial of 0.6% and industrial of 1.0%.

For the three-year period 2014-2016, SCANA’s and SCE&G’s total consolidated regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase annually 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively. During 2013 SCANA recorded a net increase of approximately 18,000 regulated gas customers (growth rate of 2.2%), increasing its regulated gas customers to approximately 837,000. Of this increase, SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 7,000 gas customers (growth rate of 2.1%), increasing its total gas customers to approximately 329,000 (as of December 31, 2013).

Demand for gas changes primarily due to weather and the price relationship between gas and alternate fuels.

Gas Cost, Supply and Curtailment Plans

 SCE&G purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers in both the spot and long-term markets. The gas is delivered to South Carolina through firm transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2014 and 2018), Transco (expiring in 2017) and CGT (expiring in 2014, 2018, 2023 and 2026). The maximum daily volume of gas that SCE&G is entitled to transport under these contracts is 222,404 MMBTU from Southern Natural, 64,652 MMBTU from Transco and 425,929 MMBTU from CGT. Additional natural gas volumes may be delivered to SCE&G’s system as capacity is available through interruptible transportation.

The daily volume of gas that SEMI is entitled to transport under service agreements with CGT (expiring in 2016, 2017 and 2023) on a firm basis is 82,615 MMBTU.

SCE&G purchased natural gas, including fixed transportation, at an average cost of $5.35 per MCF during 2013 and $4.73 per MCF during 2012.

SCE&G was allocated 5,382 MMCF of natural gas storage capacity on the systems of Southern Natural and Transco. Approximately 4,039 MMCF of gas were in storage on December 31, 2013. To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, SCE&G supplements its supplies of natural gas with two LNG liquefaction and storage facilities. The LNG plants are capable of storing the liquefied equivalent of 1,880 MMCF of natural gas. Approximately 1,635 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage on December 31, 2013.

PSNC Energy purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a short-term basis at market based prices and on a long-term basis for reliability assurance at first of the month index prices plus a reservation charge in certain cases. Transco transports natural gas to North Carolina through transportation agreements with varying expiration dates through 2032. On a peak day, PSNC Energy is capable of receiving daily transportation volumes of natural gas under these contracts, utilizing firm contracts of 610,062 MMBTU from Transco.

PSNC Energy purchased natural gas, including fixed transportation, at an average cost of $5.13 per MMBTU during 2013 compared to $4.65 per MMBTU during 2012.

To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking services. Underground natural gas storage service agreements with Dominion Transmission, Inc., Columbia Gas Transmission, Transco and Spectra Energy provide for storage capacity of approximately 13,000 MMCF. Approximately 10,000 MMCF of gas were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2013. In addition, PSNC Energy’s LNG facility can store the liquefied equivalent of 1,000 MMCF of natural gas with regasification capability of approximately 100 MMCF per day. Approximately 900 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at December 31, 2013. LNG storage service agreements with Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG provide for 1,300 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of storage space. Approximately 1,100 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2013.

SCANA and SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to accommodate growth.

Gas Marketing-Nonregulated

SEMI markets natural gas and provides energy-related risk management services primarily in the Southeast. In addition, SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, markets natural gas to approximately 454,000 customers (as of December 31, 2013) in Georgia’s natural gas market. SCANA Energy’s total customer base represents an approximate 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgia’s deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state.

REGULATION

For a discussion of legislative and regulatory initiatives being implemented that will affect SCE&G’s transmission system, see Electric Operations within the Overview section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

For a discussion of the regulatory jurisdictions to which SCANA and its subsidiaries are subject, see the Regulatory Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

SCE&G has obtained FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness and to assume liabilities as a guarantor(pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act). SCE&G may issue unsecured promissory notes, commercial paper and direct loans in amounts not to exceed $1.6 billion outstanding with maturity dates of one year or less, and may enter into guaranty agreements in favor of lenders, bankers, and dealers in commercial paper in amounts not to exceed $600 million. GENCO has obtained FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness not to exceed $150 million outstanding with maturity dates of one year or less. The authority described herein will expire in October 2014.

SCE&G holds licenses under the Federal Power Act for each of its hydroelectric projects. The licenses expire as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SCE&G is presently operating the Saluda hydroelectric project under an annual license (scheduled to expire in August) while its long-term re-licensing application is being reviewed by FERC.

At the termination of a license under the Federal Power Act, FERC may extend or issue a new license to the previous licensee, or may issue a license to another applicant, or the federal government may take over the related project. If the federal government takes over a project or if FERC issues a license to another applicant, the federal government or the new licensee, as the case may be, must pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project, not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages.

RATE MATTERS

For a discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G, and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

Prior to the first billing cycle of January 2014, SCE&G's retail electric rates for its residential and certain small commercial customers included an eWNA approved by the SCPSC, which largely mitigated the impact of weather on electric margins. In connection with a December 2013 SCPSC order, SCE&G discontinued the eWNA.

SCE&G’s retail electric rates include certain costs associated with its DSM Programs as authorized by the SCPSC. More specifically, these rates include the costs and lost net margin revenue associated with DSM Programs, along with an incentive for investing in such programs. 

Under the BLRA, SCE&G is allowed to file revised rates with the SCPSC each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation. Requested rate adjustments are based on SCE&G’s updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 11%.

In May 2011 and in November 2012, the SCPSC approved updated capital cost schedules sought by SCE&G that, among other matters, incorporated then-identifiable additional capital costs and revised substantial completion dates for the New Units, and included amounts to resolve certain claims. Details of these SCPSC approvals are further described in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G. 

11

In December 2012, the SCPSC approved a 4.23% overall increase in SCE&G's retail electric base rates and authorized SCE&G an allowed return on common equity of 10.25% (related to non-BLRA expenditures). The SCPSC also approved a mid-period reduction to the cost of fuel component in rates, as well as a reduction in the DSM Programs component rider to retail rates, among other things. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G for additional details. 

SCE&G’s gas rate schedules for its residential, small commercial and small industrial customers include a WNA approved by the SCPSC, which is in effect for bills rendered for billing cycles in November through April. The WNA increases tariff rates if weather is warmer than normal and decreases rates if weather is colder than normal. The WNA does not change the seasonality of gas revenues, but reduces fluctuations in revenues and earnings caused by abnormal weather.

PSNC Energy is authorized by the NCUC to utilize a CUT which allows PSNC Energy to adjust its base rates semi-annually for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer consumption, whether impacted by weather or other factors.

Fuel Cost Recovery Procedures

The SCPSC’s fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in SCE&G’s retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any over-collection or under-collection from the preceding 12-month period. The statutory definition of fuel costs includes certain variable environmental costs, such as ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and particulates. SCE&G may request a formal proceeding concerning its fuel costs at any time. SCPSC proceedings related to SCE&G's cost of fuel component are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

SCE&G’s natural gas tariffs include a PGA clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred, including transportation costs. SCE&G’s gas rates are calculated using a methodology which may adjust the cost of gas monthly based on a 12-month rolling average. SCPSC proceedings related to SCE&G's natural gas tariffs are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

PSNC Energy is subject to a Rider D rate mechanism which allows it to recover from customers all prudently incurred gas costs, including gas costs that were uncollectible from certain customers. The Rider D rate mechanism also allows it to recover, in any manner authorized by the NCUC, losses on negotiated gas and transportation sales.

PSNC Energy’s rates are established using a benchmark cost of gas approved by the NCUC, which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the market price of natural gas. PSNC Energy revises its tariffs with the NCUC as necessary to track these changes and accounts for any over- or under-collections of the delivered cost of gas in its deferred accounts for subsequent rate consideration. The NCUC reviews PSNC Energy’s gas purchasing practices annually. In addition, PSNC Energy utilizes a CUT which allows it to adjust its base rates semi-annually for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer consumption. NCUC proceedings related to PSNC Energy's rates are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and hazardous waste management. Developments in these areas may require that equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or replaced. The ultimate effect of these regulations and standards upon existing and proposed operations cannot be predicted. For a more complete discussion of how these regulations and standards impact SCANA and SCE&G, see the Environmental Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

OTHER MATTERS
