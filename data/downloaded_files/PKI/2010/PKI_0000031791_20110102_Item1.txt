Our strategy includes:  

       Achieving significant growth in both of our core business segments, Human Health and Environmental Health, through strategic acquisitions and licensing;  

       Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;  

       Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;  

       Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and  

       Attracting, retaining and developing talented and motivated employees.  

Recent Developments  

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently acquired the following businesses:  

Business Combinations and Asset Purchases:  

Acquisition of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG. In February 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG (chemagen). chemagen manufactures and sells nucleic acid sample preparation systems and reagents utilizing M-PVA magnetic bead technology. We expect this acquisition to enhance our genetic screening business by expanding our product offerings to diagnostics, academic and industrial end markets. We paid the shareholders of chemagen approximately $35.0 million in cash at the closing for the stock of chemagen, plus potential additional consideration of up to $20.3 million. The purchase price is also subject to potential adjustments for chemagens indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of chemagens equity holders. We expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of VisEn Medical Inc. In July 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of VisEn Medical Inc. (VisEn). VisEn is an in vivo molecular imaging technology company. We expect this acquisition to enhance our cellular imaging business by expanding our technologies and capabilities into preclinical research undertaken in academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies. We paid the equity holders of VisEn $23.0 million in cash for the stock of VisEn, of which $18.2 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of $4.8 million is held in an escrow account to secure potential adjustments for VisEns indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of VisEns equity holders. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we finalized the purchase price and related allocation resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets, included in long-term liabilities, of $8.5 million and a decrease in goodwill of $8.5 million. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.  

Acquisition of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC. In May 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of SGL Newco, Inc., the parent company of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC (Signature Genomic). Signature Genomic is a provider of diagnostic cytogenetic testing of chromosome abnormalities in individuals with unexplained physical and developmental disabilities. We expect this acquisition to expand our existing genetic testing business and expand our position in early detection of disease, specifically in the molecular diagnostics market. We paid the equity holders of Signature Genomic $90.0 million in cash, of which $77.5 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of $12.5 million is held in an escrow account to secure certain adjustments for Signature Genomics indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of Signature Genomics equity holders. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.  

Acquisition of Remaining Interest in the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Joint Venture. In May 2010, we acquired the remaining fifty percent equity interest in our joint venture (the ICPMS Joint Venture) with the company previously known as MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) product line and other related tangible assets from DH Technologies Development Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation (Danaher). We expect this acquisition will help support the continued success of the premier ICPMS product line by allowing us to direct development with a dedicated and consistent approach. The fair value of the acquisition was $67.7 million, including cash consideration of $35.0 million, non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets we own, and $30.4 million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held prior to the acquisition. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $25.6 million from the re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. This pre-tax gain is reported in interest and other (income) expense, net, for fiscal year 2010. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.  

We recently took the following additional actions to further strengthen our core businesses:  

Restructuring:  

During fiscal year 2010, we incurred a $12.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. We also recognized an $11.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. Our management approved these plans principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets and to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain other end markets. The restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space were offset by the recognition of a $3.0 million gain that had been deferred from a previous sales-leaseback transaction on this facility. We also recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $2.3 million relating to our previous restructuring plans due to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring

 expenses and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products, respectively. We expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we will incur offsetting costs.  

Discontinued Operations:  

Divestiture of Illumination and Detection Solutions Business. In November 2010, we sold our Illumination and Detection Solutions (IDS) business, which was included in our Environmental Health segment, for approximately $500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date. We expect the divestiture of our IDS business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure, and to provide capital to reinvest in other Human Health and Environmental Health end markets. The buyer acquired our IDS business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in Germany, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in Singapore and Germany. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.  

Divestiture of Photoflash Business. In June 2010, we sold our Photoflash business for approximately $13.5 million, including a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $4.4 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.  

As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following action:  

Share Repurchase Program:  

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors (our Board) authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program). On August 31, 2010, we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of January 2, 2011, approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase from the 15.0 million shares authorized by our Board under the Repurchase Program. From January 3, 2011 through February 24, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $80.6 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program.  

Business Segments and Products  

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and Environmental Health. We performed our annual impairment testing on January 4, 2010, the annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value), we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.

Marketing  

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces. As of January 2, 2011, we employed approximately 3,000 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.  

Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies  

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in Item 1A. Risk Factors for an additional description of this issue.  

Intellectual Property  

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear  

11  

Table of Contents 

 royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.  

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of these matters.  

Backlog  

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.  

Competition  

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.  

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.  

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.  

Research and Development  

Research and development expenditures were approximately $95.4 million during fiscal year 2010, approximately $90.8 million during fiscal year 2009, and approximately $93.0 million during fiscal year 2008.  

We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2011, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment.

Environmental Matters  

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.  

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.  

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $6.0 million as of January 2, 2011, which represents our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.  

In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. We accrued $9.7 million representing our managements estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters, which was damaged in the fire. We paid $2.5 million during fiscal year 2009, $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We sold the building on April 27, 2010. Net proceeds from the sale were $11.0 million, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.4 million in operating income.  

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.  

Employees  

As of January 2, 2011, we employed approximately 6,200 employees in our continuing operations, compared to employing approximately 8,200 employees in our continuing operations one year earlier. The primary reason for the decrease in the number of our employees is due to the sale of our IDS business, which was partially offset by investments in higher growth geographic regions. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers councils. As of January 2, 2011, we employed an aggregate of approximately 800 union and workers council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Reporting Segments  

The expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, have been included as Corporate below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.  

The table below sets forth sales and operating income (loss) by reporting segment for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008:

Financial Information About Geographic Areas  

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year 2010, we had $1,034.4 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 61% of our total sales. During fiscal year 2010, we derived approximately 43% of our international sales from our Human Health segment, and approximately 57% of our international sales from our Environmental Health segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.  

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
