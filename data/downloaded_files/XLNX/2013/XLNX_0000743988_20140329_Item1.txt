ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx, the Company or we) designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies, including:

•integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs), including programmable System on Chips (SoCs) and three-dimensional ICs, or 3D ICs;

•software design tools to program the PLDs;

•targeted reference designs;

•printed circuit boards; and

•intellectual property (IP), which consists of Xilinx and various third-party verification and IP cores.

In addition to its programmable platforms, Xilinx provides design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. 

Our PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that our customers program to perform desired logic functions, and programmable SoCs, which combine industry standard ARM® processor-based systems with programmable logic in a single device. We also design and develop 3D ICs, which combine multiple FPGA logic die or a combination of FPGA and transceiver die in a single package to exceed the capacity and bandwidth of monolithic devices. Our product portfolio is designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. 

We sell our products and services through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and electronic manufacturing service providers (EMS). Sales are generated by these independent distributors, independent sales representative or our direct sales organization. 

Xilinx was founded and incorporated in California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com.

Industry Overview 

There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Xilinx designs and develops PLDs, a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs may include application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs). PLDs, ASICs and ASSPs may be utilized in many of the same types of electronic systems. However, differences in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, capacity, features and functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine which devices are best-suited for specific applications. 

3
PLDs have key competitive advantages over ASICs and ASSPs, including:

•Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility. Both of these advantages are enabled by Xilinx desktop software which allows users to implement and revise their designs quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes. 

•PLDs are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many different users for a myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized for an individual user or a specific application. 

PLDs are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size when compared to chips that are designed to perform a fixed function in a single or small set of applications. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be smaller than PLDs performing the same fixed function, resulting in a lower unit cost. However, there is a high fixed cost associated with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to PLD customers. This fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development is expected to significantly increase on next generation technology nodes. From a total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when used in high-volume production, and PLDs have generally been more cost effective when used in low- to mid-volume production. However, we expect PLDs to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation technology nodes. 

An overview of typical PLD end market applications for our products is shown in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for expansion is the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next generation electronic systems. The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can only be justified for high-volume or highly-specialized commodity products. Programmable platforms, alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product requirements - cost, power, performance and density - in a business environment characterized by increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP non-recurring engineering costs and increased economic and development risk.

With every new generation of FPGAs, our strategy is to increase the performance, density and system-level functionality and integration, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. This enables us to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and design methodologies allowing our customers to focus on innovation and differentiation of their products.

Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors such as Altera Corporation (Altera), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi), and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (Marvell) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (Texas Instruments), as well as from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Other competitors include manufacturers of: 

•high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

•ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; 

•high-speed, low-density CPLDs;

•high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;

•products with embedded processors;

•products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and 

•other new or emerging programmable logic products.

We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:

•product pricing;

•time-to-market;

•product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;

•field upgradability;

•adaptability of products to specific applications;

•ease of use and functionality of software design tools;

•availability and functionality of predefined IP; 

•inventory and supply chain management;

•access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; 

•ability to provide timely customer service and support; and

•access to advanced packaging technology.

Design Platforms and Services

Programmable Platforms

We offer three types of programmable platforms that support our customers’ designs and reduce their development efforts: 

The Base Platform is the delivery vehicle for all of our new silicon offerings used to develop and run customer-specific software applications and hardware designs. Released at launch, the Base Platform is comprised of: FPGA silicon; Vivado® Design Suite design environment; integration support of optional third-party synthesis, simulation, and signal integrity tools; reference designs; development boards and IP.

The Domain-Specific Platform targets one of the three primary Xilinx FPGA user profiles: the embedded processing developer; the DSP developer; or the logic/connectivity developer. It accomplishes this by augmenting the Base Platform with a targeted set of integrated technologies, including: higher-level design methodologies and tools; domain-specific IP including embedded, mixed signal, video, DSP and connectivity; domain-specific development hardware and reference designs; and operating systems and software.

The Market-Specific Platform enables software or hardware developers to quickly build and run their specific application or solution. Built for specific markets such as automotive, consumer, aerospace and defense, communications, audio, video and broadcast, industrial, or scientific and medical, the Market-Specific Platform integrates both the Base and Domain-Specific Platforms with higher targeted applications elements such as IP, reference designs and boards optimized for a particular market.

Design Tools

To accommodate the various design methodologies and design flows employed by the wide range of our customers’ user profiles such as system designers, algorithm designers, software coders and logic designers, we provide the appropriate design environment tailored to each user profile for design creation, design implementation and design verification. During April 2012, Xilinx introduced the next-generation Vivado Design Suite designed to improve developer productivity resulting in faster design integration and implementation. The Vivado Design Suite hallmarks include an easy-to-use IP-centric design flow and significant improvement in run times. The standards-based Vivado tools include high-level synthesis to provide a more direct flow in retargeting DSPs and general purpose processor designs into our FPGAs, IP Integrator to rapidly stitch together cores at higher levels of abstraction, and a new analytical place-and-route engine which significantly improves run times. The Vivado Design Suite supports both Xilinx 7 series FPGAs and Zynq-7000, our programmable SoCs.

The previous generation tool suite, the ISE® Design Suite, supports Xilinx 7 series FPGAs, programmable SoCs and all previous generation FPGAs, enabling customers to transition to the Vivado Design Suite when the timing is right for their design needs. Both the Vivado Design Suite and ISE Design Suite operate with a wide range of third-party Electronic Design Automation software point-tools offerings.

Intellectual Property 

Xilinx and various third parties offer hundreds of no charge and fee-bearing IP core licenses covering Ethernet, memory controllers, Interlaken and PCIe® interfaces, as well as an abundance of domain-specific IP in the areas of embedded, DSP and connectivity, and market-specific IP cores. In addition, our products and technology leverage industry standards such as ARM AMBA® AXI-4 interconnect technology, IP-XACT and IEEE P1735 encryption to facilitate plug-and-play FPGA design and take advantage of the large ecosystem of ARM IP developers.

Development Boards, Kits and Configuration Products

Adopting this standard for all of our base boards enables the creation of a scalable and extensible delivery mechanism for all Xilinx programmable platforms.

We also offer comprehensive development kits including hardware, design tools, IP and reference designs that are designed to streamline and accelerate the development of domain-specific and market-specific applications.

8
Finally, Xilinx offers a range of configuration products including one-time programmable and in-system programmable storage devices to configure Xilinx FPGAs. These programmable read-only memory (PROM) products support all of our FPGA devices. 

Third-Party Alliances 

Xilinx and certain third parties have developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP, boards, tools, services and support through the Xilinx alliance program. Xilinx also works with these third parties to promote our programmable platforms through third-party tools, IP, software, boards and design services.

Engineering Services

Xilinx engineering services provide customers with engineering resources to augment their design teams and to provide expert design-specific advice. Xilinx tailors its engineering services to the needs of its customers, ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation.

Research and Development

Our research and development (R&D) activities are primarily directed toward the design of new ICs, the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the design of logic IP, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering PLD power consumption. As a result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several years including the Virtex UltraScale, Kintex UltraScale, Virtex-7, Kintex-7, Artix-7 and Zynq-7000 families. We have made enhancements to our IP core offerings and introduced Vivado tools, our next generation software design suite. We extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of 65nm, 45nm, 40nm and 28nm manufacturing technology, enabling us to be the first company in the PLD industry to ship 45nm high-volume as well as 28nm and 20nm FPGA devices. Additionally, our investment in R&D has allowed us to ship the industry’s first 28nm with embedded ARM technology as well as the industry’s first 3D IC devices.

Our R&D challenge is to continue to develop new products that create value-added solutions for customers. In fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, our R&D expenses were $492.4 million, $475.5 million and $435.3 million, respectively. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success and are committed to maintaining a significant level of R&D investment. 

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs, EMSs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs and EMSs. 

We use a dedicated global sales and marketing organization as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts. Distributors and independent sales representatives create demand within the balance of our customer base in defined territories. Distributors also provide inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM customers. 

Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, including such risks as credit loss, inventory shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability. 

In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a change in list prices subsequent to the initial sale. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors’ end customers. 

Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide. As of March 29, 2014 and March 30, 2013, Avnet accounted for 55% and 64%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 46%, 46% and 48% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not carry many of the inventory risks posed by ASICs, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition. See "Note 2. Summary of Significant 

9
Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about concentrations of credit risk and "Note 16. Segment Information" for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations.

No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012. 

Backlog 

As of March 29, 2014, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $322.0 million, compared to $253.0 million as of March 30, 2013. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result, backlog from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs. Rather, we purchase our wafers from independent foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), TSMC, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung). Currently, UMC manufactures the majority of our wafers and TSMC manufactures the wafers for our newest products. 

Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer foundry. 

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading-edge process technologies, and we adjust loadings at particular foundries to meet our business needs.

Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by independent test subcontractors or by Xilinx personnel. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our test services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan and Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved and currently maintains quality management systems certification to TL9000/ISO9001 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore and Hyderabad, India. In addition, Xilinx achieved and currently maintains ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 environmental health and safety management system certifications in the San Jose and Singapore locations.

Patents and Licenses

While our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of March 29, 2014, we held over 3,200 issued United States (U.S.) patents, which vary in duration, and over 300 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our proprietary technology. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, IP cores, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to our products and business. We have licensed some parties to certain portions of our patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third-party patents as well. 

We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or embedded in our PLDs, such as processors. Those licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell these PLDs to our customers. We also have acquired various licenses to certain third-party proprietary software, open-source software and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend. 

10
We maintain the Xilinx trade name and trademarks, including the following trademarks that are registered in the U.S. and other countries: Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Artix, ISE, Kintex, Spartan, Virtex, Vivado and Zynq. Maintaining these trademarks, and the goodwill associated with them, is important to our business. We have also obtained the rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are related to our products and business.

We intend to continue to protect our IP rights (including, for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) vigorously. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.

Corporate Responsibility

Xilinx places a high level of importance on corporate responsibility. Through senior-level sponsorship, regular environmental, health and safety assessments and company-wide performance targets, we strive to achieve a culture that emphasizes contribution to local and global communities through a number of key initiatives:

Company
