PART I  

Item 1. Business   

Overview  

We are a leading provider of technology, services and solutions to the diagnostics, research, environmental, safety and security, industrial and laboratory services markets. Through our advanced technologies, applications, and services, we address critical issues that help to improve the health and safety of people and their environment.  

We are a Massachusetts corporation, founded in 1947. Our headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, and we market our products and services in more than 150 countries. As of January 3, 2010, we employed approximately 8,200 employees in continuing operations. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PKI and we are a component of the S&P 500 Index.  

We maintain a website with the address http://www.perkinelmer.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Our Strategy  

Our strategy is focused on providing innovative products, applications, and services that drive productivity improvements in targeted high growth market segments and developing value-added applications and solutions to foster continued market development and expansion. For example, we launched EcoAnalytix, a global initiative to provide product, training, support and service offerings targeting food safety, water quality and biofuels development applications. To execute on our strategy and drive higher revenue growth, we focus on broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative technology and expenditures for research and development. Our strategy includes:  

       Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;  

       Achieving significant growth in both of our focus areas through strategic acquisitions and licensing;  

       Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;  

       Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and  

       Attracting, retaining and developing talented and motivated employees.  

Recent Developments  

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:  

Business Combinations and Asset Purchases:  

Acquisition of Remaining Interest in the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Joint Venture. In January 2010, we entered into a binding letter agreement with DH Technologies Development Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation, to purchase the remaining interest in our joint venture with MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) product line. We expect this acquisition will help ensure the continued success of the premier ICPMS product line through a dedicated and consistent approach. We anticipate that the transfer of the interest will be completed by the end of

 the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. We expect to pay approximately $35.0 million in cash for this acquisition, and to record a gain on our previously held interest. We expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.  

Purchase of Intangible Assets from GE Healthcare. In September 2009, we purchased the core technology and patents of GE Healthcares 3H and 14C Catalog Radiochemicals, Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) reagents and Cytostar-T plate portfolios for aggregate consideration of $12.0 million in cash. The Catalog Radiochemical products are used for a variety of research applications, including screening of potential drug candidates through binding assays. The SPA bead-based light-emitting assay and Cytostar-T plate technologies are offerings that enable the automation of High Throughput Screening (HTS) processes to help drug discovery researchers determine if potential new drug compounds are effective against their intended disease targets. We expect that incorporation of these technologies will strengthen our G-protein-coupled receptor and Kinase research product lines and complement our HTS and research reagent solutions. The core technology and patents that we purchased do not meet the definition of a business, as the purchased assets were not accompanied by any associated processes. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We report the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of our Human Health segment from the purchase date.  

Acquisition of Sym-Bio LifeScience Co., Ltd. In August 2009, we acquired the outstanding equity interests of Sym-Bio LifeScience Co., Ltd. (Sym-Bio). Sym-Bio is a major supplier of diagnostics instruments and related reagents, particularly in the area of infectious diseases, to hospitals in China. We expect this acquisition to expand our access to the hospital market segment in China, offering a larger base from which to expand our prenatal and newborn screening business in the country and providing us with a significant diagnostics manufacturing and research and development base within China. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. We paid the shareholders of Sym-Bio approximately $51.2 million in cash for this acquisition plus an additional amount of $12.5 million held in an escrow account for contingencies, of which $7.3 million is for potential additional contingent consideration with a fair value of $6.9 million at the acquisition date. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.  

Acquisition of Analytica of Branford, Inc. In May 2009, we acquired the outstanding stock of Analytica of Branford, Inc. (Analytica). Analytica is a leading developer of mass spectrometry and ion source technology. We expect this acquisition to allow us to offer our customers access to critical technologies such as time-of-flight and quadrupole mass spectrometers and new ion sources that provide more complete information as well as better throughput. We also gained significant intellectual property in the field of mass spectrometry and ion source technology. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. We paid the shareholders of Analytica approximately $21.7 million in cash for this acquisition plus up to $1.3 million in additional consideration, which we expect to pay during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.  

Acquisition of Opto Technology Inc. In January 2009, we acquired the outstanding stock of Opto Technology Inc. (Opto Technology). Opto Technology is a supplier of light-emitting diode (LED) based lighting components and subsystems. We expect this acquisition to expand our portfolio of high brightness LED components by adding optical subsystems to provide energy efficient solid state lighting solutions to original equipment manufacturers. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the customer base acquired. We paid the shareholders of Opto Technology approximately $20.6 million in cash for this acquisition plus up to $8.0 million in potential additional contingent consideration, of which we recorded $4.9 million as the fair value at the acquisition date. During fiscal year 2009, we recorded a decrease of $0.2 million to the potential additional contingent consideration as a fair value adjustment through current period

 earnings. During fiscal year 2009, we received approximately $0.2 million from the former shareholders of Opto Technology for net working capital adjustments. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.  

We recently took the following actions to further strengthen our core businesses:  

Restructuring:  

During fiscal year 2009, we incurred $9.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities. We also recognized an $11.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility. Our management approved these plans principally to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate cost savings from the restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the decline in revenue. We expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we will incur offsetting costs.  

Discontinued Operations:   

Photonics and Photoflash Businesses Divesture. In December 2008, as part of our new strategic business alignment into the Human Health and Environmental Health segments and our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, our management approved separate plans to divest our Photonics and Photoflash businesses within our Environmental Health segment. Our Photonics and Photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and modules. These products are used in a variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine tools. The distressed economic conditions during fiscal year 2009 adversely impacted our plan to market and sell the Photonics and Photoflash businesses. We initiated necessary actions during fiscal year 2009 to respond to these changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we determined that we could not effectively market and sell the Photonics business given the changed circumstances and, after careful consideration, we decided to cease our plan to actively market and sell the Photonics business. The Photonics business is no longer reflected as discontinued operations. However, we remain committed to a plan to actively market and sell the Photoflash business. This business continues to be reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.  

As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following action:  

Share Repurchase Program:  

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors (our Board) authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the New Repurchase Program). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program.

Business Segments and Products  

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and Environmental Health. We announced a new alignment of our businesses effective at the start of fiscal year 2009 that allows us to prioritize our capabilities in two key strategic operating areas. We reorganized into these two new operating segments to align our resources to meet the demands of the markets we serve and to focus on the important outcomes enabled by our technologies. The results reported for fiscal year 2009 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2008 and 2007 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes in our operating segments. In conjunction with the realignment of our operating segments, we also redefined the reporting units we use to test for the impairment of goodwill related to our businesses. We performed our annual impairment testing as of January 1, 2009, our annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value) we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.

Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies  

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See further description in the applicable risk factor under Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Intellectual Property  

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.  

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of these matters.  

Backlog  

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.  

Competition  

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.  

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We do  

12  

Table of Contents 

 compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes for industrial applications and ultra specialty lighting sources, photo detectors and photodiodes, and switched power supplies. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.  

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.  

Research and Development  

Research and development expenditures were approximately $107.3 million during fiscal year 2009, approximately $108.9 million during fiscal year 2008, and approximately $106.4 million during fiscal year 2007. The fiscal year 2007 amount included an in-process research and development (IPR&D) charge of $1.5 million related to the acquisitions of Evotec Technologies GmbH and Euroscreen Products, S.A. in January 2007.  

We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety and security markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2010, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety and security markets within our Environmental Health segment.  

Environmental Matters  

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.  

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.  

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.6 million as of January 3, 2010, which represents our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.  

In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. We accrued $9.7 million representing

 managements estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters, which was damaged in the fire. We paid $2.5 million during fiscal year 2009, $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining accrual of $1.7 million will be settled by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. We are actively marketing and have a plan to sell the building.  

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.  

Employees  

As of January 3, 2010, we employed approximately 8,200 employees in continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers councils. As of January 3, 2010, we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,200 union and workers council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.  

Financial Information About Reporting Segments  

The assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, have been included as Corporate below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas  

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year 2009, we had $1,079.3 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. During fiscal year 2009, we derived approximately 32% of our international sales from our Human Health segment, and approximately 68% of our international sales from our Environmental Health segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.  

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
