RISK FACTORS 

Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See "FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION." 

Utility Regulatory Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas and System Energy) 

The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 

The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance charges, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. 

In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions and previously incurred capital expenditures. The regulators can disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited by statute, which could cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering such costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. Although four of the Utility operating companies (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans) currently obtain recovery under formula rate plans, at some point in the future these formula rate plans may no longer be extended, at which time these Utility operating companies would operate again in a more traditional rate case environment. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana were required by the LPSC to file full rate cases by January 2013 when their current formula rate plans expire. 

The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, which could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

The Utility operating companies recover fuel and purchased power costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 

The Utility operating companies recover their fuel and purchased power costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies.

The Utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction and operation of generating resources has been changed by the FERC, which will require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process. 

The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005, the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule. 

In 2007 through 2011, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 FERC decision on the cost allocation methodology. There have been challenges to the level of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the FERC’s decision and the prudence of the Utility operating companies’ production costs. The ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, could be uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings. The outcome and timing of this FERC proceeding and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 

There is uncertainty as to the timing or form of any successor arrangement to the System Agreement and the effect of such arrangement (or absence thereof) on Entergy and the Utility operating companies. 

Based upon the effect of the FERC decision described in the preceding risk factor, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided notice of its intent to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. In November 2007, Entergy Mississippi provided its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. Each notice of termination is effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of notice (December 2013 for Entergy Arkansas and November 2015 for Entergy Mississippi) or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. The FERC accepted the notices in November 2009; the LPSC and City Council have requested rehearing of that order. In February 2011, the FERC denied the request for rehearing. The LPSC has appealed the FERC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and oral argument was held January 13, 2012. 

The Utility operating companies have concluded that joining the MISO RTO is in the best interest of all stakeholders and are seeking regulatory approvals to accomplish the transfer of functional control of their transmission assets to the MISO RTO by December 2013. However, Entergy cannot predict when or whether it will obtain the approvals necessary to join the MISO RTO, when the Utility operating companies’ generation and transmission systems can be fully integrated into the MISO RTO, or whether alternative arrangements will need to be implemented to allow Entergy Arkansas, and eventually Entergy Mississippi, to operate independent of the System Agreement, and the effect such arrangements (or the absence thereof) will have on Entergy or the Utility operating companies. 

For further information regarding the FERC and APSC proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation – System Agreement” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries.

The arrangement for the operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system faces regulatory and operating challenges and uncertainty in connection with the Utility operating companies’ proposal to move to the MISO RTO and the scheduled expiration of the current Independent Coordinator of Transmission arrangement in November 2012. 

In 2000, the FERC issued an order encouraging utilities to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control of an independent RTO. In November 2006, the Utility operating companies installed the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), a regional transmission organization, as their Independent Coordinator of Transmission (ICT) with responsibility for certain transmission tariff functions, including granting or denying transmission service, administering OASIS, evaluating all transmission requests, and serving as the reliability coordinator. The initial term of the ICT was for four years and in November 2010 the FERC approved an extension of the ICT arrangement for two years, or until November 2012. In its order issued in March 2009 pertaining to a requested modification regarding the weekly procurement process (WPP) through the ICT arrangement, the FERC imposed conditions related to the ICT arrangement and indicated it wanted an evaluation of the success of the ICT arrangement and transmission access on the Entergy transmission system. In compliance with the FERC’s March 2009 order, the Utility operating companies filed with the FERC a process for evaluating the modification or replacement of the current ICT arrangement. An Entergy Regional State Committee (E-RSC), comprised of one representative from each of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators has been formed and, in concert with the FERC, retained an independent entity to conduct a cost/benefit analysis of comparing the ICT arrangement to a proposal under which Entergy would join the SPP RTO. The scope of the study was expanded to consider Entergy joining the MISO RTO as another alternative. On April 25, 2011, Entergy announced that each of the Utility operating companies propose joining the MISO RTO. In May 2011, the Utility operating companies submitted to each of their respective retail regulators the cost-benefit analysis comparing the ICT arrangement to joining the SPP RTO or the MISO RTO. The Utility operating companies either have filed or expect to file in 2012 applications with their local regulators seeking to join the MISO RTO and transfer control of the companies’ transmission assets to the MISO RTO. The target implementation date for joining the MISO RTO is December 2013. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the ICT and MISO, see “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation - Federal Regulation - Independent Coordinator of Transmission” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 

There is uncertainty as to whether the Utility operating companies’ proposal to join the MISO RTO by December 2013 will receive all required regulatory approvals in a timely manner and, if the proposal is approved, the nature and effect of any operational challenges the Utility operating companies might face in connection with integration into the MISO RTO. For the period of time prior to integration of all of the Utility operating companies into the MISO RTO or in the event all necessary approvals to participate in the MISO RTO are not obtained in a timely manner, an extension of the current ICT arrangement or the establishment of a similar arrangement with another qualified entity may be required. The outcome of any effort to negotiate an extension of the current arrangement or to make alternative arrangements cannot be predicted at this time.

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 

Entergy's and its Utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Although most of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear forward sales are on a pure unit-contingent basis, which depends on the availability of the asset, some of the unit-contingent contracts guarantee a specified minimum capacity factor. In the event these plants were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk if capacity factors decrease. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially affected. 

Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be “turned off.” Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plants may face lower margins due to higher costs and lower energy sales for unit-contingent power supply contracts or potentially higher energy replacement costs for unit-contingent contracts with capacity guarantees that are not met due to extended or unplanned outages. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2012, and with substantial additional amounts after that time. Entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, although the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy’s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies or System Energy. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan is expected to result in regulatory changes in the U.S. that may impose additional costs on all U.S. nuclear plants, some of which could be material. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 

The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs 

242 

Table of Contents 

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

associated with storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies’ nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs – Spent Fuel Disposal” section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

  Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $117.5 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $12.2 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy's Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $117.5 million per reactor per incident (Entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.3 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $17.5 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $117.5 million cap. 

NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to assessments (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. As of April 1, 2011, the maximum assessment amounts total $72.7 million for the Utility plants and $89.3 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL’s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment. 

As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 

Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner may contract with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the transferred funds mentioned above. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. 

In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy’s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 

New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy’s nuclear power plants. 

New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, municipalization of nuclear units, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

A failure to obtain renewed licenses for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 

The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire in June 2012, September 2013 and December 2015, respectively. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC’s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC. Initial hearings on certain of the contentions admitted by the ASLB currently are expected to begin by the end of 2012. In the Pilgrim license renewal proceeding, the ASLB has denied the last pending proposed contention and has terminated proceedings before it. Appeals of ASLB decisions remain pending before the NRC. Also pending before the NRC is a motion by Entergy affiliates requesting specific authorization to NRC staff to issue the Pilgrim license. In responding to that motion, NRC staff stated the position that whether to issue a license where no admitted contentions are pending is a matter of staff discretion. There is no schedule for NRC action on the pending appeals or motion. 

In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. For the Indian Point plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also must ensure that requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered in New York State primarily by the New York Department of State, are satisfied prior to getting the renewed licenses. For further information regarding these environmental regulations see “Environmental Regulation, Clean Water Act” in Part I, Item 1. 

The NRC operating license for Vermont Yankee was to expire in March 2012. In March 2011 the NRC renewed Vermont Yankee’s operating license for an additional 20 years, as a result of which the license now expires in 2032. Vermont Yankee also is operating under a Certificate of Public Good from the State of Vermont that expires in March 2012, but has an application pending before the Vermont Public Service Board for a new Certificate of Public Good for operation until March 2032. For additional discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the financial statements. 

If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants, see “ENTERGY’S BUSINESS – Entergy Wholesale Commodities – Property – Nuclear Generating Stations” in Part I, Item 1 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries.

The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date or if current regulatory requirements change which then could require additional funding.  

Under NRC regulations, Entergy’s nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of our decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. In the event the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.  

With respect to the decommissioning trusts for Indian Point 2 and Palisades, the total amount in each of those trusts as of December 31, 2011 would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term radiological decommissioning of the respective unit as of the license termination date of each respective plant, but rather the funds would have been sufficient to place the unit in a condition of safe storage status pending future completion of decommissioning. For example, if an Entergy subsidiary decides to shut down and immediately begin decommissioning one of those nuclear power plants on its license expiration date, its trust funds for the plant as of December 31, 2011 would have been insufficient and the applicable Entergy subsidiary would have been required to rely on other capital resources to fund the remainder of the radiological decommissioning obligations unless the completion of decommissioning could be deferred during some number of years of safe storage status (as is permitted by NRC regulations). If any Entergy subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct a prompt decommissioning, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources.  

Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected.  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk through either advance sale of energy and capacity into forward markets or accepting spot prices primarily in day-ahead markets. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 88%, 81%, 39%, 25% and 25% of its generation portfolio's planned energy output for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. In order to hedge future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. 

Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power 

246

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 

Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 

The price that different counterparties offer for forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The recent economic downturn and negative trends in the energy commodity markets have resulted in lower natural gas prices, and current prevailing market prices for electricity in the New York and New England power regions are therefore generally below the prices of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ existing contracts in those regions. To the extent these market conditions persist, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ realized price per MWh can be expected to continue to decline. See “Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis, Results of Operations, Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants.” With operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expiring between 2012 and 2015, and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration. 

Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy's control to a significant degree, are: 

  ·    prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;    

  ·    seasonality;    

  ·    availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;    

  ·    changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil and refined products;    

  ·    liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy’s full hedging term;    

  ·    the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;    

  ·    electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;    

  ·    the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;    

  ·    weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;    

  ·    the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions and the implementation of conservation programs;

  ·    regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;    

  ·    increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear markets;    

  ·    union and labor relations;    

  ·    changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI);    

  ·    changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and    

  ·    natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.    

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC’s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities charges for power from its facilities. 

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see “Entergy’s Business - Regulation of Entergy’s Business” in Part I, Item 1 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially affected. 

The nuclear power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from such operations and assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, including the nuclear power plants, are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit's operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets. 

As discussed in Part I, Item 1, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, Property, in this Form 10-K, the operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015 and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the states in which the plants operate and the Vermont Yankee plant is the subject of certain state and federal proceedings and federal litigation relating to continued operation of that plant. If Entergy concludes that any of these nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate significantly beyond its current license expiration date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the nuclear power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

General Business 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 

249

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy's service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 

The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the fourth quarter of 2008 and much of 2009. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal, including the Entergy Corporation $3.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in August 2012. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 

A downgrade in Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments or repay certain indebtedness. 

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant’s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation's, any of the Utility operating companies', or System Energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases and other agreements. 

Most of Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2011, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure for Entergy Wholesale Commodities business transactions of $133 million under guarantees, $20 million of guarantees that 

250 

Table of Contents 

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

support letters of credit, and $6 million of posted cash collateral to the ISOs. As of December 31, 2011 the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements could increase by $132 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2011, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $44 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. 

The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 

Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies' service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the "Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 

The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 

The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, and other regulated air contaminants from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change and initiatives to compel CO2 emission reductions are discussed below. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "Regulation of Entergy's Business – Environmental Regulation" section of Part I, Item 1. 

The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 

Entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies’ transmission system. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. Entergy has notified the SERC of potential violations of certain NERC reliability standards, including certain Critical Infrastructure Protection, Facilities Design, Connection and Maintenance, and System Protection and Control standards. Entergy is working with the SERC to provide information concerning these potential violations. In addition, FERC’s Division of Investigations is conducting an investigation of certain issues relating to the Utility operating companies compliance with certain Reliability Standards related to protective system maintenance, facility ratings and modeling, training, and communications.

The effects of weather and economic conditions and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies' results of operations. 

Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

Industrial sales volume was depressed in the latter part of 2008 and through most of 2009, in part because the overall economy declined, with lower usage across the industrial sector affecting both the large customer industrial segment as well as small and mid-sized industrial customers. It is possible that continued or recurrent poor economic conditions could result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel CO2 emission reductions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. 

In an effort to address climate change concerns, Federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units, and additional new source performance standards are expected to be proposed in 2012. Developing and implementing plans for compliance with CO2 emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" could make some of Entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. In addition, multiple lawsuits currently are pending against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. 

These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

To manage their near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas, uranium (and its conversion), coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position. 

Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations or financial position. 

Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position. 

The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 

The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements or draw on the credit support provided by the counterparties, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 

The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. 

The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations to be promulgated under the act will impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the act, certain swaps will be subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major participants in the swap market will be subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Position limits will also apply to certain swaps activities. The act requires the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking is not yet final. Both the Utility operating companies

and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin or compliance costs upon market participants or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business would be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps. 

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding. 

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy's benefit plan liabilities. The recent recession and volatility in the capital markets have affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. Guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy's pension contributions in the future. For further information regarding Entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reference is made to the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 

The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 

Terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ technology systems may adversely affect Entergy’s results of operations. 

As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy's generation facilities, an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power that affects its ability to operate, or an act against the information technology systems and network infrastructure of Entergy and its subsidiaries.

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite the implementation of security measures by Entergy and its subsidiaries, all technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to such activities. If Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised. 

If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies’ business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches also may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. 

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’ and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy's, the Utility operating companies' and System Energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy's accounting for tax obligations, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements. 

Entergy and the Utility operating companies may be unable to satisfy the conditions or obtain the approvals to complete the transaction with ITC or such approvals may contain material restrictions or conditions. 

See “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” in Entergy Corporation’s Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the agreements that Entergy entered in December 2011 to spin off its transmission business and merge it with a newly-formed subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp. The consummation of the ITC transaction is subject to numerous conditions, including (i) consummation of certain transactions and financings contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement (such as the separation of the Transmission Business conducted by the Utility operating companies, (ii) obtaining the required ITC shareholder approvals, and (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals from governmental agencies necessary to consummate the ITC transaction, and that no such regulatory approvals impose a burdensome condition on ITC or Entergy as described in the Merger Agreement. Entergy can make no assurances that the ITC transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. Governmental agencies may not approve the ITC transaction or may impose conditions to the approval of the ITC transaction or require changes to the terms of the ITC transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the ITC transaction, imposing costs on or limiting the revenues of Entergy or the Utility operating companies or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the ITC transaction. Any condition or change could result in a burdensome condition on the Transmission Business or ITC under the Merger Agreement and might cause Entergy or ITC to abandon the ITC transaction. In addition, Entergy must pay its costs related to the ITC transaction including, legal, accounting, advisory, financing and filing fees and printing costs, whether the ITC transaction is completed or not. Any failure to consummate the ITC transaction as currently contemplated, or at all, could have a material effect on the business and results of operations of Entergy and the Utility operating companies and the trading price of Entergy Corporation’s common stock could be adversely affected.

(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) 

The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's and Entergy New Orleans' results of operations and liquidity. 

Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted quarterly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's or Entergy New Orleans' cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans which could adversely affect results of operations. 

(System Energy) 

System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 

System Energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy filed in October 2011 an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf’s operating license to 2045. The NRC accepted the filing in December 2011 and there is an expected NRC review period of 22 months before an order would be issued. System Energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies' support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the "Grand Gulf - Related Agreements" section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the "Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements" section of Part I, Item 1. 

(Entergy Corporation) 

Entergy Corporation's holding company structure could limit its ability to pay dividends. 

Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries’ ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, reference is made to the "COMMON EQUITY – Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions" section of Note 7 to the financial statements.

If completed, the transaction with ITC may not achieve its anticipated results. 

Entergy entered into the ITC transaction with the expectation that it would result in various benefits, including the receipt by Entergy’s shareholders of shares of ITC common stock as a result of the transaction. If the ITC transaction is consummated, it is possible that the full strategic, financial, operational and regulatory benefits to Entergy and its shareholders that Entergy expected would result from the ITC transaction may not be achieved or that such benefits may be delayed or not occur due to unforeseen changes in market, economic or regulatory conditions or other events. As a result, the aggregate market price of the common stock of Entergy Corporation and the shares of ITC common stock that shareholders of Entergy Corporation would receive in the ITC transaction could be less than the market price of Entergy Corporation’s common stock if the ITC transaction had not occurred.

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business 

See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income decreased $7.7 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate, lower other income, and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, substantially offset by higher net revenue, lower depreciation and amortization expenses, and lower interest expense. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $105.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue, a lower effective income tax rate, higher other income, and lower depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses. 

Net Revenue 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective July 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the rate case settlement. 

The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010 in accordance with regulatory treatment. The gains resulted in an increase in 2010 in interest and investment income and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income. 

259 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to a revision to transmission investment equalization billings under the Entergy System Agreement among the Utility operating companies (for the approximate period of 1996 – 2011) recorded in the fourth quarter 2011. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by more favorable weather-adjusted usage in the residential sector. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower margins on co-owner contracts and lower wholesale billings to affiliate companies due to lower expenses. 

The capacity acquisition recovery variance is primarily due to the cessation of the capacity acquisition rider to recover expenses incurred because those costs are recovered in base rates effective July 2010. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,078 GWh, or 10%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily in the small industrial customers segment, as well as in the petroleum refining, chemicals, industrial inorganic, and pulp and paper industries, reflecting strong sales growth on continuing signs of economic recovery. The effect of more favorable weather was the primary driver of the increase in residential and commercial sales. 

The provision for regulatory proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective July 2010, partially offset by the recovery in 2009 of 2008 extraordinary storm costs, as approved by the APSC, which ceased in January 2010. The recovery of storm costs is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the rate case settlement and the 2008 extraordinary storm costs. 

In 2009, Entergy Arkansas capitalized $12.5 million of Ouachita Plant service charges that were previously expensed. The result of the capitalization in 2009 was a decrease in net revenues with an offsetting decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses. 

The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust. The gains resulted in an increase in interest and investment income and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income in accordance with regulatory treatment. 

260 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to reduced margin on wholesale contracts including lower capacity billings to an affiliate for the Ouachita unit that was later purchased by the affiliate in November 2009, and lower margins on co-owner contracts, somewhat offset by lower wholesale energy costs. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $98.6 million in rider revenues primarily due to lower System Agreement payments in 2010;    

  ·    a decrease of $95.6 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to a change in the energy cost recovery rider rate change effective April 2010; and    

  ·    a decrease of $72.5 million in gross wholesale revenue due to decreased sales to affiliated customers and the expiration of a wholesale customer contract in 2009.    

The decrease was offset by volume/weather, as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market price of purchased power. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $6.1 million in fossil-fueled generation costs due to higher fossil plant outage costs due to a greater scope of work in 2011;    

  ·    an increase of $3.9 million in transmission and distribution maintenance work in 2011;    

  ·    $3.5 million in contract costs due to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO; and    

  ·    an increase of $3 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher labor and contract costs caused by several factors.    

The increase was offset by a $7.5 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. 

Other income decreased primarily due to the investment gains on the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010, as discussed above in net revenue, and the carrying charges on storm restoration costs recorded in 2010 related to the January 2009 ice storm. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the 2009 ice storm costs and Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the August 2010 issuance of securitization bonds to finance these costs. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $21.7 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;    

  ·    an increase of $6.2 million in vegetation and maintenance expenses; and    

261 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    an increase of $5.4 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher labor costs, higher materials costs, and additional projects.    

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $19.4 million due to 2008 storm costs which were deferred per an APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. 

Other income increased primarily due to the investment gains on the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust discussed above in net revenue. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 44.6%, 39.6%, and 55.0%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In April 2011, several thunderstorms with either tornados or straight-line winds caused damage to Entergy Arkansas’s transmission and distribution lines, equipment poles, and other facilities. The incurred cost of repairing that damage is $70 million, of which $19 million is operating and maintenance costs that are charged against the storm cost provision, and the remainder is capital investment. 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow from operations increased $51.9 million in 2011 primarily due to: 

  ·    income tax refunds of $90 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $66.4 million in 2010. In 2011, Entergy Arkansas received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds result from a decrease in 2010 taxable income from what was previously estimated because of the recognition of additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with a tax accounting change filed in 2010 and from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas previously made cash tax payments; and    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

262 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The increase was offset by under-recovery of fuel costs and spending resulting from the April 2011 storms discussed above. 

Cash flow from operations increased $128.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in net revenue as discussed above, ice storm spending in 2009, and the collection of previously under-recovered fuel costs through the normal operation of the energy cost recovery rider. The increase was offset by an increase of $112 million in pension contributions, and an increase of $65 million in income tax payments. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. In 2010 Entergy Arkansas made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $90.3 million in 2011 primarily due to an increase of $66.3 million in nuclear fuel purchases primarily due to the purchase of nuclear fuel inventory from System Fuels because the Utility companies will now purchase nuclear fuel throughout the nuclear fuel procurement cycle, rather than purchasing it from System Fuels at the time of refueling. The increase is also due to $51 million in storm restoration spending resulting from the April storms as discussed above, and $30 million in transmission substation reliability work in 2011. The increase was partially offset by money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $24.1 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $12.6 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $131.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the sale to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana of one-third of the Ouachita plant for $75 million in 2009;    

  ·    proceeds from the sale/leaseback of nuclear fuel of $118.6 million in 2009. See Note 18 to the financial statements for a discussion of the consolidation of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity effective January 1, 2010; and    

  ·    increases in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the ANO 1 reactor coolant pump upgrade project and security upgrades.    

The increase was offset by a decrease in distribution construction expenditures as a result of an ice storm hitting Entergy Arkansas’s service territory in the first quarter 2009. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $64.9 million in 2011 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $575 million of first mortgage bonds by Entergy Arkansas and $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds by Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, in 2010 compared to the issuance of the $55 million Series J note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in 2011; and    

  ·    a decrease in borrowings on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility.    

The increase was offset by: 

  ·    the retirement of $450 million of first mortgage bonds and $139.5 million of pollution control revenue bonds in 2010 compared to the retirement of the $35 million Series G note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in 2011; and    

  ·    a decrease of $55.6 million in common stock dividends in 2011.    

263 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $23.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    retirements of $450 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010;    

  ·    retirements of $139.5 million of pollution control bonds in 2010; and    

  ·    an increase of $125.1 million in common stock dividends paid in 2010.    

The increase was offset by: 

  ·    issuances of $575 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; and    

  ·    the issuance in August 2010 of $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds by Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas.    

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Arkansas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas.    

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $234 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

In addition, Entergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $31.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $26.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $113.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, the ability to access capital, and the outcome of Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the Entergy System Agreement (which is discussed in “System Agreement” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis). Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Arkansas’s long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Arkansas had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $394.9 million.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Hot Spring Energy Facility Purchase Agreement 

In April 2011, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Hot Spring Energy Facility, a 620 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle turbine plant located in Hot Spring County, Arkansas, from a subsidiary of KGen Power Corporation. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $253 million. Entergy Arkansas also expects to invest in various plant upgrades at the facility after closing and expects the total cost of the acquisition, including plant upgrades, transaction costs, and contingencies, to be approximately $277 million. A new transmission service request has been submitted to the ICT to determine if investments for supplemental upgrades in the Entergy transmission system are needed to make energy from the Hot Spring Energy Facility deliverable to Entergy Arkansas for the period after Entergy Arkansas exits the System Agreement. The initial results of the service request were received in January 2012 and indicate that available transfer capability does not exist with existing transmission facilities and that upgrades are required. The studies do not provide a final and definitive indication of what those upgrades would be. Entergy Arkansas has submitted transmission service requests for facilities studies which, when performed by the ICT, will provide more detailed estimates of the transmission upgrades and the associated costs required to obtain network service for the Hot Spring plant. Accordingly there are still uncertainties that must be resolved. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC and the FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In February 2012 the FERC issued an order approving the acquisition. Closing is expected to occur in mid-2012. 

In July 2011, Entergy Arkansas filed its application with the APSC requesting approval of the acquisition and full cost recovery. In January 2012, Entergy Arkansas, the APSC General Staff, and the Arkansas Attorney General filed a Motion to Suspend the Procedural Schedule and Joint Stipulation and Settlement for consideration by the APSC. Under the settlement, the parties agreed that the acquisition costs may be recovered through a capacity acquisition rider and agreed that the level of the return on equity reflected in the rider would be submitted to the APSC for resolution. Because the transmission upgrade costs remain uncertain, the parties requested that the APSC suspend the procedural schedule and cancel the hearing scheduled for January 24, 2012, pending resolution of the transmission costs. The APSC issued an order accepting the settlement as part of the record and directing Entergy Arkansas to file the transmission studies when available and directing the parties to propose a procedural schedule to address the results of those studies. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Arkansas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Arkansas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas’s corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy Arkansas’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In April 2011, Entergy Arkansas entered into a new $78 million credit facility that expires in April 2012. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Entergy Arkansas credit facility as of December 31, 2011. 

Entergy Arkansas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Arkansas has also obtained an order from the APSC authorizing long-term securities issuances through December 2012. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 

Retail Rates 

2009 Base Rate Filing 

In September 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. In June 2010 the APSC approved a settlement and subsequent compliance tariffs that provide for a $63.7 million rate increase, effective for bills rendered for the first billing cycle of July 2010. The settlement provides for a 10.2% return on common equity. 

Production Cost Allocation Rider 

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings. These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas’s deferred fuel cost balance, because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. 

See Note 2 to the financial statements and Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - System Agreement” for discussions of the System Agreement proceedings. 

Energy Cost Recovery Rider 

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. 

In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an investigation into Entergy Arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. The investigation focused on Entergy Arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. In March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in Entergy Arkansas's March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October 2006.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In January 2007 the APSC issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. The APSC found that Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. The coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and Entergy Arkansas has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. The APSC staff was directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas’s assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within 60 days of the order. After a final determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the order. In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s petition for rehearing and for stay of the APSC order. 

In October 2008 Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas’s rehearing petition and because the value for Entergy Arkansas’s customers obtained through the resolved railroad litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions identified by the APSC as imprudent. In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas’s rehearing request and the unresolved issues in the proceeding. The APSC ordered the parties to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which the parties did. In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for rehearing, and held a hearing in September 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy Arkansas. A decision is pending. Entergy Arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

The APSC also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through September 2010. Testimony has been filed and the APSC will decide the case based on the record in the proceeding, including the prefiled testimony. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

Entergy Arkansas January 2009 Ice Storm 

In January 2009, a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas’s transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs. In June 2010, the APSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of storm cost recovery bonds, including carrying costs of $11.5 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs. In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, issued $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the issuance of the storm cost recovery bonds. 

Federal Regulation 

See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

268 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to ANO and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines and includes in-service examinations, replacement and mitigation strategy. Several major modifications to the ANO units have been implemented to mitigate the susceptibility of large bore dissimilar metal welds. In addition, a replacement reactor vessel head has been fabricated for ANO 2 and is onsite. Routine inspections of the existing ANO 2 reactor vessel head have identified no significant material degradation issues for that component. These inspections will continue at planned refueling outages. Timing for installation of the new reactor vessel head will be based on the results of future inspection efforts. 

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2011 was $33.7 million. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be approximately $53 million. Entergy Arkansas’s contributions to the pension trust were $120.4 million in 2011 and are currently estimated to be approximately $31.9 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Arkansas in 2011 were $17 million, including $6.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $18.1 million, including $5.8 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects to contribute approximately $26.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2012.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business 

See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income increased $12.3 million primarily due to lower interest expense and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher effective income tax rate. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $37.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue, a lower effective income tax rate, and lower interest expense, offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, and higher taxes other than income taxes. 

Net Revenue 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in credits passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to less favorable weather on the residential sector as well as the unbilled sales period. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 62 GWh, or 0.3%, in billed electricity usage, primarily due to increased consumption by an industrial customer as a result of the customer’s cogeneration outage and the addition of a new production unit by the industrial customer. 

The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel recovery. 

280 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to a revision to transmission investment equalization billings under the Entergy System Agreement among the Utility operating companies (for the approximate period of 1996 – 2011) recorded in the fourth quarter 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the revision. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase in deferred fuel expense due to the timing of receipt of System Agreement payments and credits to customers;    

  ·    an increase in natural gas fuel expense primarily due to increased generation; and    

  ·    an increase in deferred fuel expense due to fuel and purchased power expense decreases in excess of lower fuel cost recovery revenues.    

The increase was offset by a decrease in the average market price of purchased power and decreased net area demand. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan increases effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan increases. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,861 GWh, or 10%, in billed electricity usage, primarily in the industrial sector as a result of increased consumption in the chemicals industry, and also the effect of more favorable weather on the residential and commercial sectors. 

The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009 relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $100.9 million in rider revenues due to lower System Agreement credits in 2010;    

  ·    formula rate plan increases effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010, as noted above;    

  ·    an increase of $64.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to increased usage primarily in the industrial sector; and    

  ·    the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above.    

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in gross wholesale revenues primarily due to the transfer of several wholesale customers to Entergy Texas in 2009 and decreased system agreement remedy receipts. 

281

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the average market price of purchased power. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to the amortization of lower expenses associated with the planned maintenance and refueling outage at River Bend in the first quarter 2011. 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $6 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to fewer outages and a reduced scope of work compared to 2010; and    

  ·    a decrease of $4.2 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in costs due to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO, as well as several individually insignificant items. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to a revision in the second quarter 2010 related to depreciation on storm cost-related assets and an increase in plant in service. Recovery of the storm cost-related assets will now be through the Act 55 financing of storm costs as approved by the LPSC in June 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    redemptions of first mortgage bonds of $68 million in June 2010 and $304 million in November 2010, partially offset by the issuance of first mortgage bonds of $250 million in October 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of long-term debt; and    

  ·    interest expense accrued in 2010 related to the expected result of the LPSC Staff audit of the fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel recovery.    

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $12.4 million in fossil expenses due to higher plant maintenance costs and plant outages and a $12.1 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefit costs. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenues primarily in the residential and commercial sectors and an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates, a higher 2010 assessment, and a reduction in capitalized property taxes as compared to 2009. 

Other income decreased primarily due to a decrease of $30.1 million in interest and investment income related to the debt assumption agreement with Entergy Texas. In June 2010, Entergy Texas repaid the outstanding assumed debt and the debt assumption agreement was terminated. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding as a result of redemptions of first mortgage bonds of $292 million in December 2009, $68 million in June 2010, and $304 million in November 2010, partially offset by issuances of first mortgage bonds of $300 million in October 2009 and $250 million in October 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the decrease in long-term debt.

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates were 30.3%, 28.5%, and 36.8% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $244 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    proceeds of $240.3 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings in 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    higher nuclear refueling outage spending at River Bend. River Bend had a refueling outage in 2011 and did not have one in 2010.    

The decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $56.3 million in 2011 compared to income tax refunds of $16.8 million in 2010. In 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana previously made cash tax payments. 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $491.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    storm cost proceeds of $240.3 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings;    

  ·    the absence in 2010 of the storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    income tax refunds of $16.8 million in 2010 compared to income tax payments of $60.6 million in 2009. In 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana previously made cash tax payments.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $274.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment in 2010 of $150.3 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $90.1 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in nuclear fuel purchases because River Bend had a refueling outage in 2011 and did not have one in 2010. 

Decreases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $39.4 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $12.9 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $255.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment of $150.3 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $90.1 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

  ·    proceeds from the sale/leaseback of nuclear fuel of $72.8 million in 2009. See Note 18 to the financial statements for discussion of the consolidation of nuclear fuel company variable interest entities effective January 1, 2010; and    

  ·    an increase in construction expenditures primarily due to $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at River Bend. See “New Nuclear Development” below.    

The increase was partially offset by the purchase of one-third (Unit 3) of the three-unit, 789 MW Ouachita Power Plant for $75 million in November 2009 from Entergy Arkansas and money pool activity. 

Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool increased by $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to increasing by $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $171.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase of $177.7 million in common equity distributions. 

Financing activities used cash of $173.8 million in 2010 compared to providing cash of $146.7 million in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    net cash issuances of $178.2 million of long-term debt in 2009;    

  ·    net cash redemptions of $38.6 million of long-term debt in 2010; and    

  ·    an increase of $93.6 million in common equity distributions.

Capital Structure 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana as of December 31, 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in member’s equity as a result of an increase of $177.6 million in common equity distributions. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members’ equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred equity maturities or retirements;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    distribution and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations:

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has $318.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 

Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements. 

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. 

New Nuclear Development 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC’s general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project. In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the development activities. The testimony and legal briefs of the LPSC staff generally support the request of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, although other parties filed briefs, without supporting testimony, in opposition to the request. An evidentiary hearing was held in October 2011 and the ALJ’s decision is pending. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred equity/membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

All debt and common and preferred equity/membership interest issuances by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred equity/membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2011. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. 

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike 

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In October 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana drew all of its $85 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s request to defer and accrue carrying cost on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm cost or final carrying cost rate. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. 

In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $244.1 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $240.3 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $90 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $150.3 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana used $150.3 million to acquire 1,502,643.04 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. 

Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project 

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012 hearing dates. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 

The rates that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Retail Rates – Electric 

In March 2005, the LPSC approved a settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. The settlement included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that, among other provisions, establishes a return on common equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula rate plan filing in June 2005. The formula rate plan was subsequently extended one year. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 test years.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s 2007 test year filing and provided for a formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% - 11.40%). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a $36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC. In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.8 million reduction in rates effective in the June 2010 billing cycle and a $0.5 million refund. At its May 19, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. 

In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.25% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70% share of River Bend, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate increase for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $7.8 million increase in the revenue requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.12% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The revised filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $25.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective, beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in January 2011. 

In May 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a special formula rate plan rate implementation filing with the LPSC that implements effective with the May 2011 billing cycle a $5.1 million rate decrease to reflect adjustments in accordance with a previous LPSC order relating to the acquisition of Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center by Entergy Louisiana. As a result of the closing of the acquisition and termination of the pre-acquisition power purchase agreement with Acadia, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s allocation of capacity related to this unit ended, resulting in a reduction in the additional capacity revenue requirement. 

In May 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2010 test year. The filing reflects an 11.11% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflects a $22.8 million rate decrease for incremental capacity costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff subsequently filed a joint report that also stated that no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan, and the LPSC approved it in October 2011. 

In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is required to file a full rate case by January 2013, if the LPSC has not acted to deny the requested transmission change-of-control to the MISO RTO. If the LPSC has denied this request, then the rate case must be filed by September 30, 2012.

Retail Rates – Gas 

In January 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2008. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $529 thousand based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $255 thousand rate increase pursuant to an uncontested settlement with the LPSC staff. 

In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2009. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus fifty basis points, resulting in no rate change. In April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a revised evaluation report reflecting changes agreed upon with the LPSC Staff. The revised evaluation report also resulted in no rate change. 

In January 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2010. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 8.84% and a revenue deficiency of $0.3 million. In March 2011, the LPSC Staff filed its findings, suggesting an adjustment that will produce an 11.76% earned return on common equity for the test year and a $0.2 million rate reduction. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented the $0.2 million rate reduction effective with the May 2011 billing cycle. The LPSC docket is now closed. 

In January 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2011. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.48%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5%, plus or minus fifty basis points. The sixty-day review and comment period for this filing remains open. 

Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 

In January 2003 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit included a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff reached a settlement to resolve the audit that requires Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to refund $18 million to customers, including the realignment to base rates of $2 million of SO2 costs. The ALJ held a stipulation hearing and in November 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement. The refund was made in the November 2011 billing cycle. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana had previously recorded provisions for the estimated outcome of this proceeding. 

In December 2011 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate another proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 2005 through 2009. 

In April 2010 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause filings for its gas distribution operations. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana for the period from 2003 through 2008. Discovery was completed and, in June 2011, the LPSC Staff filed an audit report generally supporting the appropriateness of charges flowed through the purchased gas adjustment clause filings. The LPSC approved the staff audit report in October 2011. 

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend nuclear power plant. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business 

See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income increased $242.5 million primarily due to a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts, which resulted in a $422 million income tax benefit. The net income effect was partially offset by a $199 million regulatory charge, which reduced net revenue, because a portion of the benefit will be shared with customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income decreased slightly by $1.4 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, a higher effective income tax rate, and higher interest expense, almost entirely offset by higher net revenue. 

Net Revenue 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The mark-to-market tax settlement sharing variance results from a regulatory charge because a portion of the benefits of a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts will be shared with customers, slightly offset by the amortization of a portion of that charge beginning in October 2011. See Notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective May 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan increase. 

302 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,095 GWh, or 4%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily as a result of increased consumption by a large customer in the chemical industry as the result of a plant expansion. The increase was partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. 

Other regulatory charges (credits) 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts because a portion of the settlement will be shared with customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,253 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily as a result of increased consumption by a large customer in the petroleum refining industry, as well as increases in the chemical industry. The effect of more favorable weather was the primary driver of the increase in the residential and commercial sales. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a net increase in the formula rate plan effective November 2009 which allowed Entergy Louisiana to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of settlement and the formula rate plan reset. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $200.7 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased usage;    

  ·    an increase of $114.9 million in rider revenues primarily due to lower System Agreement credits in 2010; and    

  ·    the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above.    

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the average market price of purchased power, an increase in demand, and an increase in the recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of natural gas.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $17.1 million in transmission investment equalization expenses as a result of a billing adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter 2011 related to prior transmission costs (for the approximate period of 1996-2011) allocable to Entergy Louisiana under the Entergy System Agreement and an increase of $17.5 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall higher scope of outages compared to prior year and the addition of Acadia Unit 2 in April 2011. 

Other income increased primarily due to an increase of $10.8 million in distributions earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm cost financing and an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2011. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $16.2 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;    

  ·    an increase of $6.4 million in fossil expenses due to higher outage expenses compared to prior year; and    

  ·    an increase of $5.9 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor costs.    

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were (357)%, 22.3%, and 16.2%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2011 is primarily due to the reversal in the third quarter 2011 for uncertain tax positions resulting from a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and for a discussion of the IRS settlement and audits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

304 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $453 million in 2011 primarily due to proceeds of $462 million received in 2010 from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. The decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $39.6 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $28.3 million in 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of the storm cost financings. In 2011, Entergy Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds primarily result from a decrease in 2010 taxable income from what was previously estimated because of the recognition of additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with a tax accounting change filed in 2010. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $844.5 million in 2010 primarily due to proceeds of $462.4 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings, the absence in 2010 of the storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009, a decrease of $195.3 million in income tax payments, and increased recovery of fuel costs due to a higher fuel rate for the period, offset by an increase of $58.5 million in pension contributions. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of the storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. In 2010, Entergy Louisiana made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Louisiana previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $50.1 million in 2011 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment in 2010 of $262.4 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $200 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

The increase was partially offset by: 

  ·    the purchase of the Acadia Power Plant for approximately $300 million in April 2011; and    

  ·    an increase in nuclear fuel purchases because of the timing of refueling outages and the purchase of nuclear fuel inventory from System Fuels because the Utility companies will now purchase nuclear fuel throughout the nuclear fuel procurement cycle, rather than purchasing it from System Fuels at the time of refueling.    

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $49.9 million in 2011 compared to decreasing by $2.9 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $425.1 million in 2010 primarily due to the investment in 2010 of $262.4 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $200 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings, partially offset by decreased construction expenditures as a result of higher distribution construction expenditures in 2009 due to Hurricane Gustav and decreased fossil construction expenditures due to the suspension of the Little Gypsy repowering project in 2009. The decrease in construction expenditures was partially offset by an increase of $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at River Bend, as discussed below, increased nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project and the dry fuel storage project, and increased transmission construction expenditures primarily due to additional reliability work. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the storm cost financings. See MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - “Little Gypsy Repowering Project” for a discussion of the suspension and subsequent cancellation of the Little Gypsy repowering project.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Louisiana’s financing activities provided cash of $209.5 million in 2011 compared to using cash of $99.6 million in 2010 primarily due to the following cash flow activity: 

  ·    the issuance by Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Entergy Louisiana, of $207.2 million of senior secured investment recovery bonds with a coupon of 2.04% in September 2011;    

  ·    net cash issuances of $200 million of first mortgage bonds in 2011 compared to net cash redemptions of $120 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010;    

  ·    an increase in borrowings on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility;    

  ·    borrowings of $50 million on its credit facility in 2011;    

  ·    the retirement of the $30 million Series D note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in January 2010;    

  ·    the issuance of the $20 million Series F note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in March 2011; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

The increases were offset by the following: 

  ·    common equity dividends of $358.2 million paid in 2011;    

  ·    the issuance in October 2010 of $115 million of 5% Revenue Bonds Series 2010; and    

  ·    a principal payment of $35.5 million in 2011 for the Waterford 3 sale-leaseback obligation compared to a principal payment of $17.3 million in 2010.    

Increases in Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool increased by $118.4 million in 2011. 

Entergy Louisiana’s financing activities used $99.6 million in 2010 compared to providing $361.3 million in 2009. The following cash flow activity occurred: 

  ·    net cash redemptions of $120 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010;    

  ·    the retirement in January 2010 of the $30 million Series D note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity;    

  ·    the issuance in October 2010 of $115 million of 5% Revenue Bonds Series 2010;    

  ·    the payment on credit borrowings of $24.1 million by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity;    

  ·    $20.6 million in common equity distributions in 2009; and    

  ·    a principal payment of $17.3 million in 2010 for the Waterford 3 sale-leaseback obligation compared to a principal payment of $6.6 million in 2009.    

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Capital Structure 

Entergy Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)    Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Louisiana.    

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members’ equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred equity maturities or retirements;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    distribution and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $217 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Louisiana, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Vidalia purchased power agreement and the Unit Power Sales Agreement, both of which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

307 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $23.8 million to its pension plans and approximately $10 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $229.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth, including the replacement of the Waterford 3 steam generators and the Ninemile 6 self-build project, both of which are discussed below. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 

Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements. 

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Louisiana’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. 

Waterford 3 Steam Generator Replacement Project 

Entergy Louisiana planned to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in the spring 2011. Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water reactors throughout the nuclear industry. In December 2010, Entergy Louisiana advised the LPSC that the replacement generators would not be completed and delivered by the manufacturer in time to install them during the spring 2011 refueling outage. During the final steps in the manufacturing process, the manufacturer discovered separation of stainless steel cladding from the carbon steel base metal in the channel head of both replacement steam generators (RSGs), in areas beneath and adjacent to the divider plate. As a result of this damage, the manufacturer was unable to meet the contractual delivery deadlines, and the RSGs were not installed in the spring 2011. Entergy Louisiana worked with the manufacturer to fully develop and evaluate repair options, and expects the replacement steam generators to be delivered in time for the Fall 2012 refueling outage. Extensive inspections of the existing steam generators at Waterford 3 in cooperation with the manufacturer were completed in April 2011. The review of data obtained during these inspections supports the conclusion that Waterford 3 can operate safely for another full cycle before the replacement of the existing steam generators. Entergy Louisiana has formally reported its findings to the NRC. At this time, a requirement to perform a mid-cycle outage for further inspections in order to allow the plant to continue operation until its Fall 2012 refueling outage is not anticipated. Entergy Louisiana currently expects the cost of the project, including carrying costs, to be approximately $687 million, assuming the replacement occurs during the Fall 2012 refueling outage. 

In June 2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the replacement project, including full cost recovery. Following discovery and the filing of testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement of the proceeding. The LPSC unanimously approved the settlement in November 2008. The settlement resolved the following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision to undertake the replacement project at the then-estimated cost of $511 million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the target installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest; and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extension or renewal of the formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary pro forma adjustments. Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs.

See State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery below for a discussion of the renewal of Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan for the 2011 test year and its provisions addressing the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project. 

Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project 

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012 hearing dates. 

New Nuclear Development 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC’s general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project. In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the development activities. The testimony and legal briefs of the LPSC staff generally support the request of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, although other parties filed briefs, without supporting testimony, in opposition to the request. An evidentiary hearing was held in October 2011 and the ALJ’s decision is pending. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new and existing facilities.    

Entergy Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and distribution rates are favorable.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Louisiana’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $200 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. As of December 31, 2011, $50 million was outstanding on the credit facility. 

Entergy Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. 

In January 2012, Entergy Louisiana issued $250 million of 1.875% Series first mortgage bonds due December 2014. Entergy Louisiana used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under the Entergy System money pool. 

Little Gypsy Repowering Project 

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant. In March 2009 the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project’s economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. This action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. In April 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC’s directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. In May 2009 the LPSC issued an order declaring that Entergy Louisiana’s decision to place the Little Gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent. 

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the Little Gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period. In June 2010 and August 2010, the LPSC Staff and Intervenors filed testimony. The LPSC Staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the LPSC may want to consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the LPSC may consider ordering no return; and (5)

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

indicated that Entergy Louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. In the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, Entergy Louisiana determined that it was probable that the Little Gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset. A hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the ALJ in November 2010. In January 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation. The settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover $200 million as of March 31, 2011, and carrying costs on that amount on specified terms thereafter. The settlement also provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization. In April 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to authorize the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the project and to issue a financing order by which Entergy Louisiana could accomplish such securitization. In August 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the September 2011 issuance of the securitization bonds. 

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike 

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav (and, to a much lesser extent, Hurricane Ike) caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. On October 9, 2008, Entergy Louisiana drew all of its $134 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s request to defer and accrue carrying costs on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm costs or final carrying costs rate. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. 

In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings. 

In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $468.9 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $462.4 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $200 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $262.4 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana used $262.4 million to acquire 2,624,297.11 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and there is no recourse against Entergy or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 

The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

In May 2005 the LPSC approved a rate filing settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana. The initial formula rate plan filing was made in May 2006. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 test years. 

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Louisiana’s 2006 and 2007 test year filings provided for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.25% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%). Entergy Louisiana was permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $2.5 million increase that included a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In April 2010, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.1 million reduction in rates effective in the May 2010 billing cycle and a $0.1 million refund. In addition, Entergy Louisiana moved the recovery of approximately $12.5 million of capacity costs from fuel adjustment clause recovery to base rate recovery. At its April 21, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. 

In May 2010, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.82% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for Waterford 3, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate change for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $3.5 million increase in the retail revenue requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year formula rate plan filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.82% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $2.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in December 2010. 

In May 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a special formula rate plan rate implementation filing with the LPSC that implements effective with the May 2011 billing cycle a $43.1 million net rate increase to reflect adjustments in accordance with a previous LPSC order relating to the acquisition of Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center. The net rate increase represents the decrease in the additional capacity revenue requirement resulting from the termination of the power purchase agreement with Acadia and the increase in the revenue requirement resulting from the ownership of the Acadia facility. In August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing to correct the May 2011 filing and decrease the rate by $1.1 million.

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In May 2011, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2010 test year. The filing reflects an 11.07% earned return on common equity, which is just outside of the allowed earnings bandwidth and results in no cost of service rate change under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflects a very slight ($9 thousand) rate increase for incremental capacity costs. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff subsequently filed a joint report that reflects an 11.07% earned return and results in no cost of service rate change under the formula rate plan, and the LPSC approved the joint report in October 2011. 

In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Louisiana’s current formula rate plan. The next formula rate plan filing, for the 2011 test year, will be made in May 2012 and will include a separate identification of any operating and maintenance expense savings that are expected to occur once the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project is complete. Pursuant to the LPSC decision, from September 2012 through December 2012 earnings above an 11.05% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) would be accrued and used to offset the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. If the project is not in service by January 1, 2013, earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period January 1, 2013 through the date that the project is placed in service will be accrued and used to offset the incremental revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. Upon the in-service date of the replacement steam generators, rates will increase, subject to refund following any prudence review, by the full revenue requirement associated with the replacement steam generators, less (i) the previously accrued excess earnings from September 2012 until the in-service date and (ii) any earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period following the in-service date, provided that the excess earnings accrued prior to the in-service date shall only offset the revenue requirement for the first year of operation of the replacement steam generators. These rates are anticipated to remain in effect until Entergy Louisiana’s next full rate case is resolved. Entergy Louisiana is required to file a full rate case by January 2013, if the LPSC has not acted to deny the requested transmission change-of-control to the MISO RTO. If the LPSC has denied this request, then the rate case must be filed by September 30, 2012. 

In April 2010, the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Louisiana's fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through the fuel adjustment clause by Entergy Louisiana for the period from 2005 through 2009. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established. 

In August 2000, the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Louisiana. The time period that is the subject of the audit was January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2001. The scope of this docket was expanded to include a review of annual reports on fuel and purchased power transactions with affiliates and a prudence review of transmission planning issues and to include the years 2002 through 2004. Hearings were held and in May 2008 the ALJ issued a final recommendation that found in Entergy Louisiana’s favor on the issues, except for the disallowance of hypothetical SO2 allowance costs included in affiliate purchases. The ALJ recommended a refund of the SO2 allowance costs collected to date and a realignment of these costs into base rates prospectively with an amortization of the refunded amount through base rates over a five-year period. The LPSC issued an order in December 2008 affirming the ALJ’s recommendation. Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision for the disallowance, including interest, and refunded approximately $7 million to customers in 2009. 

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard industry practices and guidelines. As discussed above in more detail, Entergy Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms. 

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity

 Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2011 was $23.6 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $37.4 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $60.6 million to its pension plans in 2011 and anticipates funding approximately $23.8 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2011 were $18.2 million, including $3.9 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $22.1 million, including $3.6 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $10 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business 

See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income increased $23.4 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $6.0 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher taxes other than income taxes, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher interest expense. 

Net Revenue 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 97 GWh in weather-adjusted usage in the residential and commercial sectors and a decrease in sales volume in the unbilled sales period. 

The transmission equalization variance is primarily due to the addition in 2011 of transmission investments that are subject to equalization. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $57.5 million in gross wholesale revenues due to an increase in sales to affiliated customers, partially offset by a decrease of $26.9 million in power management rider revenue. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in deferred fuel expense as a result of higher fuel revenues due to higher fuel rates, partially offset by a decrease in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,046 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage in all sectors, primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on the residential sector. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $22 million in power management rider revenue as the result of higher rates, the volume/weather variance discussed above, and an increase in Grand Gulf rider revenue as a result of higher rates and increased usage, offset by a decrease of $23.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of prior over-collections, offset by an increase in the average market price of purchased power coupled with increased net area demand. 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to increased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense; and    

  ·    the sale of $4.9 million of surplus oil inventory.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.9 million in legal expenses due to the deferral in 2010 of certain litigation expenses in accordance with regulatory treatment. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher 2011 assessment as compared to 2010, partially offset by higher capitalized property taxes as compared with prior year. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a revision caused by FERC’s acceptance of a change in the treatment of funds received from independent power producers for transmission interconnection projects. 

327 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates and a higher 2010 assessment as compared to 2009 and an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenues primarily in the residential and commercial sectors. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2010, including the new nuclear development project that is discussed below. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 20.9%, 37.0%, and 35.3%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2011 is primarily due to an intercompany settle up for federal income taxes for years prior to 2008 which include an allocation of the tax benefit of Entergy Corporation’s expenses to the subsidiaries generating taxable income for the respective years. Entergy Mississippi received benefits for the effects of various tax positions settled with the IRS pertaining to the 2006/2007 audit. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $20.5 million in 2011 primarily due to the purchase of $42.6 million of fuel oil inventory from System Fuels because System Fuels will no longer procure fuel oil for the Utility companies. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the recovery of fuel costs. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $101.9 million in 2010 primarily due to decreased recovery of fuel costs primarily as a result of prior period over-collections and an increase of $27.7 million in pension contributions, offset by a decrease of $7.1 million in income tax payments. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for further discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. In 2010, Entergy Mississippi received federal tax cash refunds and made state tax cash payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The federal refunds resulted from the 2009 tax return filed in 2010 and the associated true up adjustment which relates primarily to the acceleration of deductions for plant-related expenditures. The state payments result from the allocation of the combined Mississippi tax reflected on the 2009 tax return filed in 2010 and for amended Mississippi returns for 2006-2008 filed in 2010.

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased $22.3 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in construction expenditures because of a $49 million payment in 2010 to a System Energy subsidiary for costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and the repayment by System Fuels of Entergy Mississippi’s $5.5 million investment in System Fuels. The decrease was offset by money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool decreased $31.4 million in 2010. Entergy Mississippi did not have a receivable from the money pool in 2011. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $14.6 million in 2010 primarily due to increased construction expenditures resulting from a $49 million payment to a System Energy subsidiary for costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf, as discussed below, and increased transmission construction expenditures resulting from additional transmission reliability work in 2010, offset by money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool decreased $31.4 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $31.4 million in 2009. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Mississippi’s financing activities provided $51.0 million of cash in 2011 compared to using $36.2 million of cash in 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $275 million of first mortgage bonds in 2011 compared to the issuance of $80 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; and    

  ·    a decrease of $40.1 million in common stock dividends.    

The cash provided was partially offset by the redemption of $180 million of first mortgage bonds in 2011 compared to the redemption of $100 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010 and money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool decreased by $31.3 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $33.3 million in 2010. 

Entergy Mississippi’s financing activities used $36.2 million of cash in 2010 compared to providing $27.8 million of cash in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the redemption, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 7.25% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2010;    

  ·    the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009; and    

  ·    the issuance of $80 million of 6.20% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2010; offset by    

  ·    money pool activity.

Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool increased by $33.3 million in 2010 compared to decreasing by $66 million in 2009. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Mississippi’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and other capital investments, and existing debt obligations and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $129 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems, and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $8.4 million to its pension plans and approximately $5.5 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Mississippi’s long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Mississippi had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $68.5 million. 

Hinds Energy Facility Purchase Agreement 

In April 2011, Entergy Mississippi announced that it has signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Hinds Energy Facility, a 450 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle turbine plant located in Jackson, Mississippi, from a subsidiary of KGen Power Corporation. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $206 million. Entergy Mississippi also expects to invest in various plant upgrades at the facility after closing and expects the total cost of the acquisition to be approximately $246 million. A new transmission service request has been submitted to determine if investments for supplemental upgrades in the Entergy transmission system are needed to make the Hinds Energy Facility deliverable to Entergy Mississippi for the period after Entergy Mississippi exits the System Agreement. Facilities studies are ongoing to determine transmission upgrades costs associated with the plant, with results expected by early March 2012. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the MPSC and the FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In February 2012 the FERC issued an order approving the acquisition. Closing is expected to occur in mid-2012. In July 2011, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC requesting approval of the acquisition and full cost recovery. A hearing on the request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity is scheduled for February 28, 2012. A hearing on Entergy Mississippi’s proposed cost recovery has not been scheduled. 

New Nuclear Generation Development Costs 

Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi is developing a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Mississippi paid for and has recognized on its books $49 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. In October 2010, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC requesting that the MPSC determine that it is in the public interest to preserve the option to construct new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and that the MPSC approve the deferral of Entergy Mississippi’s costs incurred to date and in the future related to this project, including the accrual of AFUDC or similar carrying charges. In October 2011, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed with the MPSC a joint stipulation. The stipulation states that there should be a deferral of the $57 million of costs incurred through September 2011 in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf. The costs shall be treated as a regulatory asset until the proceeding is resolved. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi also agree that the MPSC should conduct a hearing during 2012 to consider the relief requested by Entergy Mississippi in its application, including evidence regarding whether costs incurred in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf were prudently incurred and are otherwise allowable. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi further agree that such prudently incurred costs shall be recoverable in a manner to be determined by the MPSC. In the Stipulation, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi agree that the development of a nuclear unit project option is consistent with the Mississippi Baseload Act. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi further agree that the deferral of costs incurred in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf also is consistent with the Mississippi Baseload Act. Entergy Mississippi will not accrue carrying charges or continue to accrue AFUDC on the costs, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The MPSC approved the stipulation in November 2011. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Mississippi’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Mississippi may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indenture, and other agreements. Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

In May 2011, Entergy Mississippi renewed its three separate credit facilities through May 2012 in the aggregate amount of $70 million. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2011. 

Entergy Mississippi’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Entergy Mississippi has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $175 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Mississippi has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 

The rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Mississippi is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Formula Rate Plan 

In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider. In March 2010 the MPSC issued an order: (1) providing the opportunity for a reset of Entergy Mississippi's return on common equity to a point within the formula rate plan bandwidth and eliminating the 50/50 sharing that had been in the plan, (2) modifying the performance measurement process, and (3) replacing the revenue change limit of two percent of revenues, which was subject to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap, with a limit of four percent of revenues, although any adjustment above two percent requires a hearing before the MPSC. The MPSC did not approve Entergy Mississippi's request to use a projected test year for its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing and, therefore, Entergy Mississippi will continue to use a historical test year for its annual evaluation reports under the plan. 

In March 2009, Entergy Mississippi made with the MPSC its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year. The filing reported a $27.0 million revenue deficiency and an earned return on common equity of 7.41%. Entergy Mississippi requested a $14.5 million increase in annual electric revenues, which is the maximum increase allowed under the terms of the formula rate plan. The MPSC issued an order on June 30, 2009, finding that Entergy Mississippi’s earned return was sufficiently below the lower bandwidth limit set by the formula rate plan to require a $14.5 million increase in annual revenues, effective for bills rendered on or after June 30, 2009. 

In March 2010, Entergy Mississippi submitted its 2009 test year filing, its first annual filing under the new formula rate plan rider. In June 2010 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates, but does provide for the deferral as a regulatory asset of $3.9 million of legal expenses associated with certain litigation involving the Mississippi Attorney General, as well as ongoing legal expenses in that litigation until the litigation is resolved. 

In March 2011, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2010 test year filing. The filing shows an earned return on common equity of 10.65% for the test year, which is within the earnings bandwidth and results in no change in rates. In November 2011 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior quarter. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. 

In July 2008 the MPSC began a proceeding to investigate the fuel procurement practices and fuel adjustment schedules of the Mississippi utility companies, including Entergy Mississippi. The MPSC stated that the goal of the proceeding is fact-finding so that the MPSC may decide whether to amend the current fuel cost recovery process. Hearings were held in July and August 2008. Further proceedings have not been scheduled. 

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint 

The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general’s suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court. In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint.

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In July 2011, the attorney general requested a status conference regarding its motion to remand. The court granted the attorney general’s request for a status conference, which was held in September 2011. Consistent with the court’s instructions, both parties submitted letters to the court in September 2011 providing updates on the facts of the case and the law, and the court has now taken the parties’ arguments under advisement. 

Federal Regulation 

See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2011 was $7.7 million. Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $12.3 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $29.2 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011 and anticipates that it will contribute approximately $8.4 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Mississippi in 2011 were $5.5 million, including $2 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $6.4 million, including $1.8 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects to contribute approximately $5.5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business 

See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income increased $4.9 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, lower taxes other than income taxes, a lower effective income tax rate, and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower net revenue. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income remained relatively unchanged, increasing $0.6 million, primarily due to higher net revenue and lower interest expense, almost entirely offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, lower other income, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Net Revenue 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan decreases effective October 2010 and October 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan filing. 

The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to milder weather in 2011 compared to 2010. 

The gas cost recovery asset variance is primarily due to the recognition in 2010 of a $3 million gas operations regulatory asset associated with the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas formula rate plan case and the amortization of that asset. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the formula rate plan settlement. 

344 

Table of Contents 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors due in part to a 4% increase in the average number of residential customers and a 3% increase in the average number of commercial customers, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. 

Gross operating revenues 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $16.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates;    

  ·    a decrease of $15.4 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of lower fuel rates and the effect of milder weather; and    

  ·    formula rate plan decreases effective October 2010 and October 2011, as discussed above.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross wholesale revenue due to increased sales to affiliated customers and more favorable volume/weather, as discussed above. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 348 GWh, or 7%, in billed retail electricity usage primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year. 

The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year, along with the recognition of a gas regulatory asset associated with the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas formula rate plans. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan settlement. 

The effect of 2009 rate case settlement variance results from the April 2009 settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate case, and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the operation of Grand Gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates effective June 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to the deferral in 2011 of $13.4 million of 2010 Michoud plant maintenance costs pursuant to the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s 2010 test year formula rate plan filing approved by the City Council in September 2011 and a decrease of $8.0 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to higher plant outage costs in 2010 due to a greater scope of work at the Michoud plant. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the 2010 test year formula rate plan filing.

Table of Contents 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes resulting from lower electric and gas retail revenues as compared with the same period in 2010. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment in May 2010 of the notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization and the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $15.1 million in fossil expenses due to higher outage expenses compared to prior year;    

  ·    an increase of $2.2 million in distribution expenses primarily due to increases in vegetation maintenance, overhead and underground inspections, and substation maintenance and repairs; and    

  ·    an increase of $1.9 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs.    

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates and an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher electric and gas retail revenues as compared with the same period in 2009. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income decreased primarily due to carrying costs on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs recorded in 2009. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate on notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization, in addition to the repayment of those notes in May 2010 and the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 30.6%, 34.8%, and 33.5%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates. 

Hurricane Katrina 

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to Entergy New Orleans’s service territory. Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs, including obtaining assistance through federal legislation for damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. 

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) 

In December 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included CDBG funding that allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery priorities. In March 2007, the City Council certified that Entergy New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006 that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan, and certified Entergy New Orleans’s estimated costs of $465 million for its gas system rebuild (which is discussed below). Entergy New Orleans received $180.8 million of CDBG funds in 2007 and $19.2 million in 2010. 

Gas System Rebuild 

In addition to the Hurricane Katrina storm restoration costs that Entergy New Orleans incurred, Entergy New Orleans expects that over a longer term rebuilding of the gas system in New Orleans will be necessary due to the massive salt water intrusion into the system caused by the flooding in New Orleans. The salt water intrusion is expected to shorten the life of the gas system, making it necessary to rebuild portions of that system over time, earlier

than otherwise would be expected, with the project extending many years into the future. Entergy New Orleans received insurance proceeds for a portion of the estimated future construction expenditures associated with rebuilding its gas system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution approving the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate and storm-cost recovery filings requires Entergy New Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated sub-account of other deferred credits until the proceeds are spent on the rebuild project. This other deferred credit is shown as “Gas system rebuild insurance proceeds” on Entergy New Orleans’s balance sheet. 

Bankruptcy Proceedings 

As a result of the effects of Hurricane Katrina and the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the New Orleans area, on September 23, 2005, Entergy New Orleans filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court seeking reorganization relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On May 7, 2007, the bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization. With the receipt of CDBG funds, and the agreement on insurance recovery with one of its excess insurers, Entergy New Orleans waived the conditions precedent in its plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on May 8, 2007. Included in the terms in the plan of reorganization Entergy New Orleans issued notes to affiliates. Entergy New Orleans repaid, at maturity in May 2010, these notes that represented affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million, including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was relatively flat in 2011 as the receipt of $19.2 million of Community Development Block Grant funds in 2010 related to Hurricane Katrina costs was offset by a decrease of $28.8 million in income tax payments in 2011. The decrease in income tax payments is in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The decrease results from lower 2010 taxable income from what was estimated due to revised bonus depreciation deduction and additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with the tax accounting method change filed in 2010. 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $99.6 million in 2010 primarily due to income tax payments of $68.2 million made in 2010 compared to refunds of $22.1 million received in 2009 and an increase in pension contributions of $11.9 million. In 2010, Entergy New Orleans made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy New Orleans previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010.

FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. The decrease was partially offset by the receipt of $19.2 million of Community Development Block Grant funds, as discussed above. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $14.5 million in 2011 primarily due to money pool activity and a withdrawal in 2010 from the storm escrow account related to Hurricane Gustav costs. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in construction expenditures due to decreased spending on the gas system rebuild project and System Fuels repayment of Entergy New Orleans’s $3.3 million investment in System Fuels. 

Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased $12.7 million in 2011 compared to decreasing $44.3 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $28.3 million in 2010 primarily due to money pool activity and a withdrawal from the storm escrow account that was related to Hurricane Gustav costs, partially offset by: 

  ·    higher fossil construction expenses primarily due to current year outages and the Michoud 3 generator rewind project;    

  ·    higher distribution construction expenditures primarily due to increased reliability work; and    

  ·    a decrease in Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds received in 2010 as compared to 2009.    

 Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased $44.3 million in 2010 compared to increasing $6.1 million in 2009. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $109.5 million in 2011 primarily due to the repayment in 2010 of $74.3 million of affiliate notes payable that were issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization, the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010, and the repayment of $25 million of 6.75% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2010, offset by the issuance of $25 million of 5.10% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2010. 

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $118.6 million in 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the repayment of $74.3 million of affiliate notes payable in May 2010;    

  ·    the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010;    

  ·    the repayment of $25 million of 6.75% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2010; and    

  ·    an increase of $14.1 million in dividends paid on common stock.    

The increase was partially offset by the issuance of $25 million of 5.10% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2010.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans has $53.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans reflects capital required to support existing business. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 and to the financial statements.

Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project 

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012 hearing dates.

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Rate Cases, Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders 

On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. On April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive settlement. The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion of a $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit, implemented in January 2008, to a permanent reduction and substantial realignment of Grand Gulf cost recovery from fuel to electric base rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009, with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes. A new three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1% benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point bandwidth. Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning. The formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions, plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure events. 

In May 2010, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports. The filings requested a $12.8 million electric base revenue decrease and a $2.4 million gas base revenue increase. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council's Advisors reached a settlement that resulted in an $18.0 million electric base revenue decrease and zero gas base revenue change effective with the October 2010 billing cycle. The City Council approved the settlement in November 2010. 

In May 2011, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports for the 2010 test year. The filings requested a $6.5 million electric rate decrease and a $1.1 million gas rate decrease. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s Advisors reached a settlement that results in an $8.5 million incremental electric rate decrease and a $1.6 million gas rate decrease. The settlement also provides for the deferral of $13.4 million of Michoud plant maintenance expenses incurred in 2010 and the establishment of a regulatory asset that will be amortized over the period October 2011 through September 2018. The City Council approved the settlement in September 2011. The new rates were effective with the first billing cycle of October 2011. 

The 2008 rate case settlement also included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. In September 2009 the City Council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans. The rate settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. 

In October 2006, the City Council approved a rate filing settlement agreement that, among other things, authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider that began in March 2007. These storm reserve funds will be held in a restricted escrow account.

Federal Regulation 

See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy New Orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month, including fuel price. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Effective June 2009, Entergy New Orleans reclassified the fuel component of unbilled accounts receivable to deferred fuel and will no longer include the fuel component in the unbilled calculation, which is in accordance with regulatory treatment. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2011 was $5.5 million. Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $8.5 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $12.2 million in qualified pension contributions in 2011 and anticipates approximately a $4.8 million pension contribution in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy New Orleans in 2011 were $3.7 million, including $1.2 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $4.2 million, including $1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $3.7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business 

See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income increased by $14.6 million primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher taxes other than income taxes, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased by $2.4 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower other income, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher other operation and maintenance expenses. 

Net Revenue 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate actions, including an annual base rate increase of $59 million beginning August 2010, with an additional increase of $9 million beginning May 2011, as a result of the settlement of the December 2009 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 721 GWh, or 4.5%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales compared to last year. Usage in the industrial sector increased 8.2% primarily in the chemicals and refining industries. 

The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases for ongoing purchased power capacity and additional capacity purchases. 

362 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to the base rate increases and the volume/weather effect, as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in demand coupled with an increase in deferred fuel expense as a result of lower fuel refunds in 2011 versus 2010, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of natural gas. 

Other regulatory charges decreased primarily due to the distribution in the first quarter 2011 of $17.4 million to customers of the 2007 rough production cost equalization remedy receipts. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rough production cost equalization proceedings. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to increased sales to municipal and co-op customers due to the addition of new contracts. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to increased electricity usage primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, resulting from a 1.5% increase in customers, coupled with the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. Billed electricity usage increased a total of 777 GWh, or 5%. 

The rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $18.6 million allocation recorded in the second quarter of 2009 for 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 2007, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate actions, including an annual base rate increase of $59 million beginning August 2010 as a result of the settlement of the December 2009 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

The securitization transition charge variance is due to the issuance of securitization bonds. In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. The securitization transition charge is offset with a corresponding increase in interest on long-term debt with no impact on net income. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the securitization bond issuance.

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases in ongoing purchased power capacity expense and additional capacity purchases. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $145.6 million in gross wholesale revenues as a result of the addition of new customer contracts and the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $59.9 million in fuel cost recovery revenues primarily attributable to lower fuel rates and interim fuel refunds in the first quarter 2010 and the third and fourth quarters 2010. The interim fuel refunds and the PUCT approvals are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of purchased power and natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expenses as the result of lower fuel revenues, as discussed above. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $8.5 million in transmission expenses due to a billing adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter 2011 related to prior transmission investment equalization costs (for the approximate period of 1996 - 2011) allocable to Entergy Texas under the Entergy System Agreement;    

  ·    an increase of $2.4 million in the over-recovery of energy efficiency revenues; and    

  ·    several individually insignificant items.    

The increase was partially offset by the amortization of $11 million of rate case expenses in 2010 and a decrease of $3.9 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in stock option expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher city franchise and gross receipts taxes and an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher 2011 assessment as compared to 2010, partially offset by lower street rentals. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of $11 million of rate case expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. The increase was partially offset by a charge of $6.8 million in June 2009 resulting from the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav storm cost recovery settlement with the PUCT. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of this settlement. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to a provision recorded for sales and use taxes, an increase in local franchise taxes, and an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of a higher 2010 assessment as compared to 2009, partially offset by lower millage rates. 

Other income decreased primarily due to carrying costs recorded in 2009 on storm restoration costs as approved by Texas legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery filings.

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest on deferred fuel costs and the pay-down of the debt assumption agreement liability. The decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $546 million in securitization bonds in November 2009. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates were 38.0%, 39.0%, and 36.6% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $195.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    $73.4 million of fuel cost refunds in 2011 versus $179.5 million of fuel cost refunds in 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the fuel cost refunds; and    

  ·    income tax refunds of $13.5 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $48.7 million in 2010.    

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $244.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the timing of collection of receivables from customers;    

  ·    income tax payments of $48.7 million in 2010 compared to income tax refunds of $72.3 million in 2009. In 2010, Entergy Texas made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The tax payments resulted from differences between Entergy Texas’s estimated utilization of net operating losses and actual utilization on the 2009 tax return filed in 2010;    

  ·    an $87.8 million fuel cost refund made in the first quarter 2010 and an $77 million fuel cost refund made in the third and fourth quarters 2010; and    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The decrease was partially offset by the absence in 2010 of Hurricane Ike restoration spending that occurred in 2009.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $98.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to money pool activity. 

Increases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool increased by $49.5 million in 2011 compared to decreasing by $55.6 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $95.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to money pool activity and a decrease in construction expenditures due to Hurricane Ike spending in 2009, offset by a decrease of $31.5 million in insurance proceeds and increased remittances to the securitization trust account as a result of the issuance of $546 million in securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the issuance of the securitization bonds. 

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $55.6 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $69.3 million in 2009. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Texas’s financing activities provided $10.9 million of cash in 2011 compared to using $87.0 million of cash in 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the retirement of $199 million of debt assumption liabilities and securitization bonds in 2010 compared to the retirement of $57.4 million of securitization bonds in 2011; and    

  ·    a decrease of $80.6 million in common equity distributions.    

The cash provided was partially offset by the issuance of $200 million of 3.60% Series mortgage bonds in May 2010 compared to the issuance of $75 million of 4.10% Series first mortgage bonds in September 2011. 

Entergy Texas’s financing activities used $87 million of cash in 2010 compared to providing $127.6 million of cash in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds;    

  ·    the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009;    

  ·    the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009;    

  ·    the issuance of $200 million of 3.60% Series mortgage bonds in May 2010; and    

  ·    the retirement of $199 million of debt assumption liabilities and securitization bonds in 2010 compared to $620 million in 2009.    

The use of cash was partially offset by: 

  ·    the repayment of Entergy Texas’s $160 million note payable to Entergy Corporation in January 2009;    

  ·    the repayment of $100 million outstanding on Entergy Texas’s credit facility in February 2009;    

  ·    money pool activity; and    

  ·    a decrease of $33.1 million in common equity distributions.    

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $50.8 million in 2009.

Capital Structure 

Entergy Texas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.    

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion and also including the debt assumption liability. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Texas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Texas requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt maturities or retirements;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $131 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $7.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $5.2 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Texas has $7.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Texas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Texas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Texas’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2011. 

Entergy Texas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization through October 2013 from the FERC under which it may borrow at any one time outstanding, $200 million in the aggregate. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Texas has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. 

Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav 

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Texas’s service territory. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Entergy Texas filed an application in April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable,  

368 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

including estimated costs for work to be completed. On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in the storm cost recovery case. Under the terms of the agreement $566.4 million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery. Insurance proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount. Of the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas’s request and the amount agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not directly attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in the second quarter 2009. The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as utility plant. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs, by securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization bonds. 

In the third quarter 2009, Entergy settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received $75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5 million). 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 

The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Filings with the PUCT 

2009 Rate Case 

In December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $198.7 million increase reflecting an 11.5% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2009 test year. The rate case also includes a $2.8 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which Entergy Texas retail customers are partially responsible, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas implemented a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to refund. Intervenors and PUCT Staff filed testimony recommending adjustments that would result in a maximum rate increase, based on the PUCT Staff’s testimony, of $58 million. 

The parties filed a settlement in August 2010 intended to resolve the rate case proceeding. The settlement provides for a $59 million base rate increase for electricity usage beginning August 15, 2010, with an additional increase of $9 million for bills rendered beginning May 2, 2011. The settlement stipulates an authorized return on equity of 10.125%. The settlement states that Entergy Texas's fuel costs for the period April 2007 through June 2009 are reconciled, with $3.25 million of disallowed costs, which were included in an interim fuel refund. The settlement also sets River Bend decommissioning costs at $2.0 million annually. Consistent with the settlement, in the third quarter 2010, Entergy Texas amortized $11 million of rate case costs. The PUCT approved the settlement in December 2010. 

2011 Rate Case 

In November 2011, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $112 million base rate increase reflecting a 10.6% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2011 test year. The rate case also proposed a purchased power recovery rider. The parties have agreed to a procedural schedule that contemplates a final decision by July 30, 2012, with rates relating back to June 30, 2012. On January 12, 2012, the PUCT voted not to address the purchased power recovery rider in the current rate case, but the PUCT voted to set a baseline in the rate case proceeding that would be applicable if a purchased power capacity rider is approved in a separate proceeding.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, not recovered in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. 

In January 2008, Entergy Texas made a compliance filing with the PUCT describing how its 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts under the System Agreement were allocated between Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. In December 2008 the PUCT adopted an ALJ proposal for decision recommending an additional $18.6 million allocation to Texas retail customers. Because the PUCT allocation to Texas retail customers is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to Louisiana retail customers, the PUCT's decision results in trapped costs between the Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions with no mechanism for recovery. Entergy Texas filed with the FERC a proposed amendment to the System Agreement bandwidth formula to specifically calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost equalization receipts for 2007. In May 2009 the FERC issued an order rejecting the proposed amendment. Because of the FERC's order, Entergy Texas recorded the effects of the PUCT's allocation of the additional $18.6 million to Texas retail customers in the second quarter 2009. On an after-tax basis, the charge to earnings was approximately $13.0 million (including interest). The PUCT and FERC decisions are now final. 

In May 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a four-month period beginning June 2009. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through March 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning July 2009. 

In October 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $71 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a six-month period beginning January 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $87.8 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through October 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning January 2010. 

In June 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $66 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through May 2010. In September 2010 the PUCT issued an order providing for a $77 million refund, including interest, for fuel cost recovery over-collections through June 2010. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning with the September 2010 billing cycle. 

In December 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the parties that was approved by the PUCT in March 2011, Entergy Texas refunded over-collections through November 2010 of approximately $73 million, including interest through the refund period. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period that began with the February 2011 billing cycle. 

In December 2011, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $43 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties to the proceeding reached an agreement that Entergy Texas will refund $67 million, including interest, over a three-month period, which refund includes additional over-recoveries through December 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties requested that interim rates consistent with the settlement be approved effective with the March 2012 billing month, and this request was granted by the presiding ALJ on February 16, 2012. 

Entergy Texas’s November 2011 rate case filing, which is discussed above, also includes a request to reconcile $1.3 billion of fuel and purchased power costs covering the period July 2009 through June 2011.

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base. Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Texas does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Texas’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas’s financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Texas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by 

371 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension and qualified projected benefit obligation cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2011 was $4.4 million. Entergy Texas anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $10.4 million. Entergy Texas contributed $18.2 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011. Entergy Texas’s contributions to the pension trust are currently estimated to be approximately $7.7 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Texas in 2011 were $4.1 million, including $1.5 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $6 million, including $1.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC. 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

System Energy’s principal asset currently consists of a 78.5% ownership interest and 11.5% leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenues. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2011 Compared to 2010 

Net income decreased $18.4 million primarily due to an increase in the effective income tax rate. A decrease in operating income was offset by an increase in other income and a decrease in interest expense, which led to a slight increase in income before income taxes. Operating income was lower because of lower rate base compared to 2010. Other income was higher and interest expense was lower primarily because of AFUDC accrued on the Grand Gulf uprate project. 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $33.7 million primarily due to a decrease in the effective income tax rate. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 53.9%, 40.4%, and 66.5%, respectively. The increase in the rate for 2011 is primarily due to an intercompany settle up for federal income taxes for years prior to 2008 which include an allocation of the tax benefit of Entergy Corporation’s expenses to the subsidiaries generating taxable income for the respective years. The effects of various tax positions settled with the IRS pertaining to the 2006/2007 audit require System Energy to pay back prior benefits of the Entergy Corporation’s expenses it received when the benefits were originally allocated based upon the tax return as filed. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

System Energy Resources, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $180.3 million in 2011 primarily due to income tax refunds of $100.9 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $56 million in 2010. In 2011 System Energy received cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds result from a decrease in 2010 taxable income from what was previously estimated because of the recognition of additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with a tax accounting change filed in 2010 and from the reversal of temporary differences for which System Energy previously made cash tax payments. 

Cash flow provided by operations decreased $167.5 million in 2010 primarily due to income tax payments of $56 million in 2010 compared to income tax refunds of $120.4 in 2009, and an increase of $26.6 million in pension contributions. In 2010 System Energy made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which System Energy previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $126.8 million in 2011 primarily due to: 

  ·    The proceeds from the transfer, in the first quarter 2010, of $100.3 million in development costs related to Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC;    

  ·    An increase in construction expenditures resulting primarily from spending on the power uprate project at Grand Gulf;    

  ·    The repayment in 2010 of $25.6 million by Entergy New Orleans of a note issued in resolution of its bankruptcy proceedings; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in nuclear fuel purchases due to the timing of refueling outages. 

Increases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool increased by $22.5 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $7.4 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $35.2 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase of $129.5 million in nuclear fuel purchases due to the timing of refueling outages, and an increase in construction expenditures primarily due to the Grand Gulf power uprate project. The increase was partially offset by: 

  ·    the proceeds from the transfer of $100.3 million in development costs related to Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC discussed below;    

  ·    money pool activity; and    

  ·    the repayment by Entergy New Orleans of a $25.6 million note issued in resolution of its bankruptcy proceedings.    

Increases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool increased by $7.4 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $47.6 million in 2009.

Financing Activities 

Cash used in financing activities increased $131.4 million in 2011 primarily due to the issuance of $60 million of 5.33% Series G notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in 2010, the repayment of $38.3 million in commercial paper in 2011 as compared to the issuance of $20.3 million in commercial paper in 2010, and the partial retirement of $40 million of 6.2% pollution control bonds in 2011. The increase was slightly offset by a $24 million decrease in dividend paid on common stock. 

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $40.3 million in 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance in April 2010 of $60 million of 5.33% Series G notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity to finance its fuel procurement activities; and    

  ·    commercial paper issuances by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity to finance its fuel procurement activities.    

The decrease was partially offset by: 

  ·    an increase of $24.9 million in dividends paid on common stock; and    

  ·    an increase of $13.3 million in the January 2010 principal payment made on the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback compared to the January 2009 principal payment.    

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

System Energy’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common shareholder’s equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

System Energy requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt maturities or retirements;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $19 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment, or systems.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $4.1 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $228.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for System Energy reflects capital required to support the existing business of System Energy. The estimate also includes the costs of System Energy’s planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. On November 30, 2009, the MPSC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for implementation of the uprate. A license amendment application was submitted to the NRC in September 2010. After performing more detailed project design, engineering, analysis and major materials purchases, System Energy’s current estimate of the total capital investment to be made in the course of the implementation of the Grand Gulf uprate project is approximately $754 million, including SMEPA’s share. The estimate includes spending on certain major equipment refurbishment and replacement that would have been required over the normal course of the plant’s life even if the uprate were not done. The purpose of performing this major equipment refurbishment and replacement in connection with the uprate is to avoid additional plant outages and construction costs in the future while improving plant reliability. The investment estimate may be revised in the future as System Energy evaluates the progress of the project, including the costs required to install instrumentation in the steam dryer in response to recent guidance from the NRC staff obtained during the review process for certain Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) issued by the NRC in December 2011. The NRC’s review of the project is ongoing. System Energy is responding to the recent RAIs and will seek to minimize potential cost effects or delay, if any, to the Grand Gulf uprate implementation schedule. 

System Energy also invested, through its subsidiary Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, in initial development costs for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf and River Bend sites, including licensing and design activities. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In addition, Entergy temporarily suspended reviews of the two license applications for the sites and will explore alternative nuclear technologies for this project. In the first quarter 2010 the $100 million in construction work in progress incurred by Entergy New Nuclear Development was transferred to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Currently, all of System Energy’s retained earnings are available for distribution.

Sources of Capital 

System Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

System Energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common stock issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

In February 2012, System Energy VIE issued $50 million of 4.02% Series H notes due February 2017. System Energy used the proceeds to purchase additional nuclear fuel. 

System Energy has obtained a short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow, through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy’s short-term borrowing limits. System Energy has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances. The current long-term authorization extends through July 2013. 

System Energy’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Nuclear Matters 

System Energy owns and operates Grand Gulf. System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Environmental Risks 

System Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of System Energy’s financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

In the first quarter 2011, System Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $38.9 million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory asset.  

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2011was $6.9 million. System Energy anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $11.5 million. System Energy contributed $28.4 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011and expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for System Energy in 2011 were $4.1 million, including $1.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $5.6 million, including $1.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy anticipates contributions for postretirement health care and life insurance benefits costs to be $4.1 million in 2012.
