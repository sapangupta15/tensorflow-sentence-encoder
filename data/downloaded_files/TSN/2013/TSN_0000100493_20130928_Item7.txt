ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY

We are one of the world’s largest meat protein companies and the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials, feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.

OVERVIEW

•General – Operating income grew 7% in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012, which was led by record earnings in our Chicken segment and improved performance in our Beef segment. Revenues increased 4% to a record $34.4 billion, driven by price and mix improvements. We were able to overcome a $1.2 billion increase in input costs through strong operational execution and margin management. The following are a few of the key drivers:

•We continued to execute our strategy of accelerating growth in domestic value-added chicken sales, prepared food sales and international chicken production, innovating products, services and customer insights and cultivating our talent development to support Tyson's growth for the future. 

•Market environment – Our Chicken segment delivered record results in fiscal 2013 driven by strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions. The Chicken segment experienced increased feed costs but was able to offset the impact with operational, mix and price improvements. Our Beef segment’s operating performance improved, despite lower domestic availability of fed cattle supplies, due to better operational execution, less volatile live cattle markets, and stronger export markets. Our Pork segment results remained within its normalized operating margin range, but were down slightly from last year due to periods of increased domestic availability of pork products. Our Prepared Foods segment was challenged by product mix and rapidly increasing raw material prices.

•Discontinued Operation – After conducting an assessment during fiscal 2013 of our long-term business strategy in China, we determined our Weifang operation (Weifang), which was part of our Chicken segment, was no longer core to the execution of our strategy given the capital investment it required to execute our future business plan. We completed the sale of Weifang in July 2013. Weifang's results are reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Our accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 – Net income included the following item:

•$19 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to recognized currency translation adjustment gain.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Sales Volume – Sales were negatively impacted by a slight decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of $255 million. This was primarily due to decreases in the Beef and Pork segments, partially offset by increases in the Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. 

•Average Sales Price – Sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.6 billion. All segments experienced increased average sales prices, largely due to continued tight domestic availability of protein, increased pricing associated with rising live and raw material costs, and improved mix. The majority of the increase was driven by the Chicken and Beef segments. 

2012 vs. 2011 –

•Sales Volume – Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of $1.7 billion. All segments, with the exception of the Pork segment, had a decrease in sales volume, with the majority of the decrease in the Beef segment.

•Average Sales Price – The increase in sales was largely due to an increase in average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $2.7 billion. All segments, with the exception of the Pork segment, had an increase in average sales prices largely due to continued tight domestic availability of protein and increased live and raw material costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average sales price in the Pork segment which was driven down by lower live hog costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Cost of sales increased by approximately $1.2 billion due to higher input cost per pound. 

•The $1.2 billion impact of higher input costs was primarily driven by:

•Increase in feed costs of $470 million in our Chicken segment.

•Increase in live cattle and hog costs of approximately $395 million.

•Increase in raw material and other input costs in our Prepared Foods segment of approximately $110 million. 

•Increase due to net losses of $15 million in fiscal 2013, compared to net gains of approximately $66 million in fiscal 2012, from our Pork segment commodity risk management activities. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact future period operating results. 

2012 vs. 2011 –

•Cost of sales increased by approximately $1.0 billion. Higher input cost per pound increased cost of sales by approximately $2.2 billion, while lower sales volume decreased cost of sales $1.2 billion.

•The $2.2 billion impact of higher input costs per pound was primarily driven by:

•Increase in live cattle and hog costs of approximately $1.5 billion.

•Increase in feed costs of $320 million and increase in other growout operating costs of $50 million in our Chicken segment.

•The $1.2 billion impact of lower sales volumes was driven by decreases in our Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments, partially offset by an increase in sales volume in our Pork segment.

19
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Increase of $79 million in selling, general and administrative is primarily driven by:

•Increase of $44 million related to employee costs including payroll and stock-based and incentive-based compensation. 

•Increase of $32 million related to advertising and sales promotions. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013/2012/2011 – Interest income remained relatively flat due to continued low interest rates. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013/2012/2011 –

•Cash interest expense included interest expense related to the coupon rates for senior notes and commitment/letter of credit fees incurred on our revolving credit facilities. The decrease in cash interest expense in fiscal 2013 is due to lower average coupon rates compared to fiscal 2012 and 2011. This decrease is driven by the full extinguishment of the 10.50% Senior Notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) in fiscal 2012, partially offset with the 4.5% Senior Notes due 2022 (2022 Notes) issued in fiscal 2012. 

•Loss on early extinguishment of debt included the amount paid exceeding the par value of debt, unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs related to the full extinguishment of the 2014 Notes.

•Losses on notes repurchased during fiscal 2011 included the amount paid exceeding the carrying value of the notes repurchased, which primarily included the repurchases of the 8.25% Notes due October 2011 (2011 Notes) and the 6.60% Senior Notes due April 2016 (2016 Notes).

•Non-cash interest expense primarily included interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances. This includes debt issuance costs incurred on our revolving credit facility, the 2014 Notes and the accretion of the debt discount on the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (2013 Notes).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 – Included $19 million related to recognized currency translation adjustment gain.

2012 – Included $16 million of equity earnings in joint ventures and $4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains.

2011 – Included $11 million gain related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. The following table is a summary of sales and operating income (loss), which is how we measure segment income (loss). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

21
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volumes grew due to increased domestic and international production driven by stronger demand for our chicken products.

•Average Sales Price – The increase in average sales price was primarily due to mix changes and price increases associated with higher input costs. Since many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we were able to offset rising input costs through improved pricing and mix.

•Operating Income – Operating income was positively impacted by increased average sales price, improved live performance and operational execution, as well as improved performance in our foreign-produced operations. These increases were partially offset by increased feed costs of $470 million. 

2012 vs. 2011 –

•Sales Volume – The decrease in sales volumes in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the impact of domestic production cuts we made in late fiscal 2011 and maintained throughout fiscal 2012, in order to balance our supply with forecasted customer demand. These production cuts reduced our total domestic slaughter pounds by approximately 4% in fiscal 2012, but were partially offset by increases in international sales volumes and open-market meat purchases.

•Average Sales Price – The increase in average sales prices is primarily due to mix changes and price increases associated with reduced industry supply and increased input costs.

•Operating Income – The increase in operating income was largely due to the increase in average sales price and operational improvements, partially offset by reduced sales volumes, increased grain, feed ingredients and other growout costs and losses incurred in our foreign start-up businesses.

•Feed Costs – Operating results were negatively impacted in fiscal 2012 by an increase in feed costs of $320 million and an increase in other growout operating costs of $50 million.

•Operational Improvements – Operating results were positively impacted by approximately $115 million of operational improvements, primarily attributed to improvements in yield, mix and processing optimization. 

•Start-up Businesses – Our foreign start-up businesses in Brazil and China incurred operating losses of approximately $70 million in fiscal 2012.

22
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume decreased due to less outside trim and tallow purchases, partially offset by increased production volumes. 

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased due to lower domestic availability of fed cattle supplies, which drove up livestock costs. 

•Operating Income – Operating income increased due to improved operational execution, less volatile live cattle markets and improved export markets, partially offset by increased operating costs. 

2012 vs. 2011 –

•Sales and Operating Income –

•Average sales price increased due to price increases associated with increased livestock costs. Sales volume decreased due to a reduction in live cattle processed and outside tallow purchases. Operating income decreased due to higher fed cattle costs and periods of reduced demand for beef products, which made it difficult to pass along increased input costs, as well as lower sales volumes and increased employee related operating costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume decreased as a result of balancing our supply with customer demand and reduced exports. 

•Average Sales Price – Demand for pork products improved, which drove up average sales price and livestock cost despite a slight increase in live hog supplies. 

•Operating Income – While reduced compared to prior year, operating income remained strong in fiscal 2013 despite brief periods of imbalance in industry supply and customer demand. We were able to maintain strong operating margins by maximizing our revenues relative to the live hog markets, partially due to operational and mix performance. 

•Derivative Activities – Operating results included net losses of $15 million in fiscal 2013, compared to net gains of $66 million in fiscal 2012 for commodity risk management activities related to futures contracts. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

2012 vs. 2011 –

•Sales and Operating Income –

•Average sales price decreased due to increased domestic availability of pork products, which drove lower live hog costs. Operating income decreased due to compressed pork margins caused by the excess domestic availability of pork products. We were able to maintain strong operating margins by maximizing our revenues relative to the live hog markets, partially due to strong export sales and operational and mix performance.

•Derivative Activities – Operating results included net gains of $66 million in fiscal 2012, compared to net losses of $32 million in fiscal 2011 from commodity risk management activities related to futures contracts. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

23
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 vs. 2012 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume increased as a result of improved demand for our prepared products and incremental volumes from the purchase of two businesses in fiscal 2013.

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased due to price increases associated with higher input costs.

•Operating Income – Operating income decreased, despite increases in sales volumes and average sales price, as the result of increased raw material and other input costs of approximately $110 million and additional costs incurred as we invested in our lunchmeat business and growth platforms. Because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we are typically able to offset rising input costs through pricing. However, there is a lag time for price increases to take effect.

2012 vs. 2011 –

•Sales and Operating Income – Operating margins were positively impacted by lower raw material costs of $75 million and increased average sales prices, which were partially offset by lower volumes and increased operational costs of approximately $30 million, largely due to costs related to revamping our lunchmeat business and the start-up of a new pepperoni plant. Because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we typically offset changing input costs through pricing. However, there is a lag time for price changes to take effect, which is what we experienced during fiscal 2011.

24
FISCAL 2014 OUTLOOK

In fiscal 2014, we expect overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase approximately 1% from fiscal 2013 levels. Grain supplies are expected to increase in fiscal 2014, which should result in lower input costs. The following is a summary of the fiscal 2014 outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook on sales, capital expenditures, net interest expense, debt and liquidity, share repurchases and dividends: 

•Chicken – We expect domestic chicken production to increase 3-4% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Based on current futures prices, we expect lower feed costs in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 of approximately $500 million. Many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, which allows us to adjust pricing when input costs fluctuate. However, there may be a lag time for price changes to take effect. For fiscal 2014, we believe our Chicken segment will be in or above its normalized range of 5.0%-7.0%.

•Beef – We expect to see a reduction of industry fed cattle supplies of 2-3% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Although we generally expect adequate supplies in regions we operate our plants, there may be periods of imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand. For fiscal 2014, we believe our Beef segment's profitability will be similar to fiscal 2013, but could be below its normalized range of 2.5%-4.5%.

•Pork – We expect industry hog supplies to increase 1-2% in fiscal 2014 and exports to improve compared to fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we believe our Pork segment will be in its normalized range of 6.0%-8.0%.

•Prepared Foods – We expect operational improvements and pricing to offset increased raw material costs. Because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we are typically able to offset rising input costs through increased pricing. As we continue to invest heavily in our growth platforms, we believe our Prepared Foods segment could be slightly below its normalized range of 4.0%-6.0% for fiscal 2014.

•Sales – We expect fiscal 2014 sales to approximate $36 billion as we continue to execute our strategy of accelerating growth in domestic value-added chicken sales, prepared food sales and international chicken production.

•Capital Expenditures – We expect fiscal 2014 capital expenditures to approximate $700 million.

•Net Interest Expense – We expect net interest expense will approximate $100 million for fiscal 2014.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Dividends – On November 14, 2013, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend previously declared on August 1, 2013, to $0.075 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.0675 per share on our Class B common stock. The increased quarterly dividend is payable on December 13, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2013. The Board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.0675 per share on our Class B common stock, payable on March 14, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2014. 

25
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, the repurchases of senior notes and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities, or short-term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Cash flows associated with Loss on early extinguishment of debt included the amount paid exceeding the par value of debt, unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs related to the full extinguishment of the 2014 Notes.

•Cash flows associated with changes in working capital:

•2013 – Decreased primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance, partially offset by increases in accrued salaries, wages and benefits and income tax payable. The higher accounts receivable balance is largely due to significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

•2012 – Decreased due to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable. The higher inventory and accounts receivable balances were driven by significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

•2011 – Decreased due to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable. The higher inventory and accounts receivable balances were driven by significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Additions to property, plant and equipment include acquiring new equipment and upgrading our facilities to maintain competitive standing and position us for future opportunities. In fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, our capital spending was primarily for production efficiencies in our operations and for ongoing development of foreign operations.

•Capital spending for fiscal 2014 is expected to approximate $700 million, and will include spending on our operations for production and labor efficiencies, yield improvements and sales channel flexibility, as well as expansion of our foreign operations. 

•Purchases of marketable securities included funding for our deferred compensation plans.

•Proceeds from notes receivable totaling $51 million in fiscal 2011 related to the collection of notes receivable received in conjunction with the sale of a business operation in fiscal 2009.

•Acquisitions in fiscal 2013 related to acquiring two value-added food businesses as part of our strategic expansion initiative which are included in our Prepared Foods segment.

26
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Payments on debt included –

•2013 – $91 million primarily related to borrowings at our foreign operations.

•2012 – $885 million for the extinguishment of the 2014 Notes and $103 million related to borrowings at our foreign operations.

•2011 – $315 million of 2011 Notes; $63 million of 2016 Notes; $2 million of 7.0% Notes due May 2018 (2018 Notes); and $103 million related to borrowings at our foreign operations.

•Net proceeds from borrowings included –

•2013 – $68 million primarily from our foreign operations. Total debt related to our foreign operations was $60 million at September 28, 2013 ($40 million current, $20 million long-term).

•2012 – We received net proceeds of $995 million from the issuance of the 2022 Notes. We used the net proceeds towards the extinguishment of the 2014 Notes, including the payments of accrued interest and related premiums, and general corporate purposes. Additionally, our foreign operations received proceeds of $115 million from borrowings. Total debt related to our foreign operations was $102 million at September 29, 2012 ($62 million current, $40 million long-term). 

•2011 – Our foreign operations received proceeds of $106 million from borrowings. Total debt related to our foreign operations was $98 million at October 1, 2011 ($58 million current, $40 million long-term). Additionally, Dynamic Fuels received $9 million in proceeds from short-term notes in fiscal 2011.

•In fiscal 2011, the minority interest partner in our 60%-owned Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods joint ventures in China exercised put options requiring us to purchase its entire 40% equity interest. The transaction closed in fiscal 2011 for cash consideration totaling $66 million.

•Purchases of Tyson Class A common stock include –

•$550 million, $230 million and $170 million for shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and

•$64 million, $34 million and $37 million for shares repurchased to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

27
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and letters of credit. The letters of credit issued under this facility are primarily in support of workers’ compensation insurance programs and derivative activities.

•Our 2013 Notes matured in October 2013. Upon maturity, we paid the $458 million principal value with cash on hand, and settled the conversion premium by issuing 11.7 million shares of our Class A stock from available treasury shares. Simultaneous to the settlement of the conversion premium, we received 11.7 million shares of our Class A stock from call options we entered into concurrently with the 2013 Note issuance.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. Rather, we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. Our U.S. income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital Resources

Credit Facility

Cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed maximum capacity of $1.0 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities. As of September 28, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $42 million issued under this facility, none of which were drawn upon, which left $958 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 44 banks, with commitments ranging from $0.3 million to $90 million per bank. The syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.

Capitalization

To monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long-term financing decisions. At September 28, 2013, and September 29, 2012, the ratio of our debt-to-total capitalization was 27.9% and 28.7%, respectively. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of current and long-term debt. Total capitalization is defined as debt plus Total Shareholders’ Equity.

Warrants

In September 2008, in conjunction with the issuance of convertible bonds, we sold warrants in private transactions for total proceeds of $44 million. The warrants permit the purchasers to acquire up to approximately 27 million shares of our Class A stock at the current exercise price of $22.16 per share, subject to adjustment. The warrants are exercisable on various dates from January 2014 through April 2014. A 10% increase in our share price above the $22.16 warrant exercise price would result in the issuance of 2.5 million incremental shares. At $28.60, our closing share price on September 28, 2013, the incremental shares we would be required to issue upon exercise of the warrants would have resulted in 6.1 million shares. 

Credit Ratings

2016 Notes

On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC business (S&P) upgraded the credit rating of these notes from "BB+" to "BBB-." On March 29, 2011, Moody's Investors Services, Inc. (Moody's) upgraded the credit rating of these notes from "Ba2" to "Ba1." These upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.35% to 6.85%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due April 1, 2011.

On June 7, 2012, Moody's upgraded the credit rating of these notes from "Ba1" to "Baa3." This upgrade decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 6.60%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due October 1, 2012.

28
On February 11, 2013, S&P upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 Notes from "BBB-" to "BBB." This upgrade did not impact the interest rate on the 2016 Notes.

A one-notch downgrade by Moody's would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by 0.25%. A two-notch downgrade from S&P would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by 0.25%.

Revolving Credit Facility

S&P’s corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is "BBB." Moody’s senior, unsecured, subsidiary guaranteed long-term debt rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is "Baa3." Fitch Ratings', a wholly owned subsidiary of Fimalac, S.A. (Fitch), issuer default rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is "BBB." The below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility (Facility Fee Rate) and letter of credit fees (Undrawn Letter of Credit Fee and Borrowing Spread) depending on the rating levels of Tyson Foods, Inc. from S&P, Moody's and Fitch.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the event the rating levels are split, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies, or, if all three rating agencies have different rating levels, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies.

Debt Covenants

Our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios.

Our 2022 Notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 28, 2013.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.

29
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 28, 2013:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.

(2) Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at September 28, 2013, and expected payment dates.

(3) Amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.

(4) Amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.

(5) Amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. For certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of September 28, 2013. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancelable. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.

(6) Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of September 28, 2013.

(7) Amounts include items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $175 million and related interest and penalties of $63 million at September 28, 2013, recorded as liabilities.

The maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at September 28, 2013, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $340 million, or approximately $296 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical.

Contingent liabilities    

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

Marketing and advertising costs    

We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in-store display incentives, coupons and other programs.

Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program.

Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. 

Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program.

These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

A 10% change in our marketing accruals at September 28, 2013, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $6 million.

Accrued self-insurance    

We are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims.

We use an independent third-party actuary to assist in determining our self-insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self-insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self-insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range. 

Our self-insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used.

Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self-insurance liability to change.

Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self-insurance liability to change. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

A 10% increase in the actuarial estimate at September 28, 2013, would result in an increase in the amount we recorded for our self-insurance liability of approximately $11 million. A 10% decrease in the actuarial estimate at September 28, 2013, would result in a decrease in the amount we recorded for our self-insurance liability of approximately $17 million.

Income taxes    

We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income.

Federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be taxable upon remittance to the United States, except for earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset.

We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.

Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future.

Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate.

Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.

To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.

Impairment of long-lived assets    

Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset or a change in its physical condition.

When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long-lived asset.

We recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $74 million, $29 million and $18 million, in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long-lived asset, including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.

Our Dynamic Fuels consolidated joint venture began commercial operations in October of 2010 and has incurred net operating losses of approximately $38 million since then. At September 28, 2013, Dynamic Fuels had $166 million of total assets, of which $142 million was net property, plant and equipment. The plant has experienced mechanical difficulties, pre-treatment system performance issues and hydrogen supply disruptions, which have contributed to plant down time and higher than expected operational costs. Upgrades to the feedstock pre-treatment systems and improvements to the mechanical reliability of the plant were completed in fiscal 2013. 

The plant was idled in October 2012 for scheduled maintenance and plant upgrades, which were completed in December 2012. Since then, the plant has remained idled. An assessment of the recoverability of its carrying value was conducted as of September 28, 2013, for which it was determined no impairment was necessary. Another assessment of the recoverability of Dynamic Fuels' long-lived assets to determine whether an impairment exists may be necessary if the plant remains idled longer than expected, plant upgrades fail to improve operational performance, industry economics make the plant uneconomical to operate, or structural integrity concerns are discovered that adversely impact the plant operations. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets during the last three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long-lived assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. 

Additionally, we continue to evaluate our international operations and strategies, which may expose us to future impairment losses. 

Impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets

Description: Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. We can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. 

The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any.

The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

33
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business).

For other indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. Similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2013 impairment test.

We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.

Judgments and Uncertainties: We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.

We include assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries.

Other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace.

Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions: We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years other than the adoption of the new guidance allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test.

The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to an average of 8.4% in fiscal 2013 from 8.0% in fiscal 2012. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions.

During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore, the second step was not necessary. 

Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates and our credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other indefinite life intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step, which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.

All of our material reporting units' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. Consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test.

Our fiscal other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. A hypothetical 20% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment.
