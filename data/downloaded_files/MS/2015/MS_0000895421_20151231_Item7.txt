Executive Summary.  

Overview of Financial Results.  

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Consolidated Results.  

       The Company reported net revenues of $35,155 million in 2015, a 3% increase from net revenues of $34,275 million in 2014. The impact of debt valuation adjustment (DVA) included in net revenues was positive $618 million and $651 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

       Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley for the current year was $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, compared with $3,467 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share, a year ago. The current year included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, compared with $2,226 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, in the prior year. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein. The prior year also included litigation costs related to residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis matters of $3,083 million, or a loss of $1.47 per diluted common share, 2014 compensation actions of approximately $1,137 million (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein), or a loss of $0.39 per diluted common share, and a funding valuation adjustment (FVA) implementation charge of $468 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted common share.  

       Excluding DVA, net revenues were $34,537 million in 2015 compared with $33,624 million in 2014, and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,728 million, or $2.70 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with $3,049 million, or $1.39 per diluted common share, in 2014. Excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefits, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with $823 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, in 2014.  

Business Segments.  

       Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,953 million in 2015 increased 6% compared with $16,871 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher Sales and trading net revenues, partially offset by lower Other revenues and lower revenues in Investment banking.  

       Wealth Management net revenues of $15,100 million in 2015 increased 1% from $14,888 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher net interest income and asset management revenues, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.  

       Investment Management net revenues of $2,315 million in 2015 decreased 15% from $2,712 million in 2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest, reduction in revenues attributable to non-controlling interests and markdowns on principal investments.  

Expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses of $16,016 million in 2015 were down 10% from $17,824 million in 2014, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in 2015 in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and carried interest, and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses were $10,644 million in 2015 compared with $12,860 million in 2014, representing a 17% decrease, primarily as a result of lower legal expenses in the Institutional Securities business segment associated with residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis-related matters.

Consolidated Results.  

       The Company reported net revenues of $34,275 million in 2014, a 5% increase compared with $32,493 million in 2013. Net revenues in 2014 included positive revenues due to the impact of DVA of $651 million compared with negative revenues of $681 million in 2013. In addition, net revenues in 2014 included a charge of approximately $468 million related to the implementation of FVA (see Critical Accounting Policies herein and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), which was recorded in the Institutional Securities business segment.  

       For 2014, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $3,467 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share, compared with $2,932 million, or $1.36 per diluted common share, in 2013. 2014 included net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, compared with $407 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share, in 2013.

Business Segments.  

       Institutional Securities net revenues of $16,871 million in 2014 increased 9% compared with $15,519 million in 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in Sales and trading net revenues and Investment banking revenues, partially offset by lower net investment gains.  

       Wealth Management net revenues of $14,888 million in 2014 increased 5% from $14,143 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher Asset management, distribution and administration fees and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.  

       Investment Management net revenues of $2,712 million in 2014 decreased 11% from $3,059 million in 2013. The decrease in net revenues was primarily related to lower net investment gains, including from investments in the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans, and lower carried interest, partially offset by higher management and administration revenues.  

Expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses of $17,824 million in 2014 increased 10% from $16,277 million in 2013, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions of approximately $1,137 million (see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses were $12,860 million in 2014 compared with $11,658 million in 2013, representing a 10% increase, primarily due to higher legal expenses.

Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) Financial Information.  

From time to time, the Company may disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines a non-GAAP financial measure as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that excludes, or includes, amounts or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with further transparency about, or as an alternative method for assessing, the Companys financial condition, operating results or prospective regulatory capital requirements. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever the Company refers to a non-GAAP financial measure, the Company will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and the U.S. GAAP financial measure.

EMEAEurope, Middle East and Africa.  

DVADebt valuation adjustment represents the change in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings resulting from the fluctuation in its credit spreads and other credit factors.  

N/MNot Meaningful.  

 (1)  The Institutional Securities business segments net income applicable to noncontrolling interests was $133 million, $109 million and $278 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Wealth Management business segments net income applicable to noncontrolling interests was $221 million in 2013. The Investment Management business segments net income applicable to noncontrolling interests was $19 million, $91 million and $182 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.  

 (2)  Pre-tax profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure to the Company and investors to assess operating performance. Percentages represent income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.  

 (3)  The computation of average common equity for each business segment is determined using the Companys Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure (see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory RequirementsRequired Capital herein). The calculation of each business segments return on average common equity equals net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of each business segments average common equity. The effective tax rates used in the computation of each business segments return on average common equity were determined on a separate legal entity basis. Average common equity and the return on average common equity for each business segment are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company considers to be useful measures to the Company and investors to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance, respectively.  

 (4)  The calculation of return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity. To determine the return on average common equity, excluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator were adjusted to exclude those items. Average common equity, the return on average common equity, and average common equity and the return on average common equity, both excluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits, are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company considers useful for investors to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance.

 (8)  See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information on the Tier 1 leverage ratio.  

 (9)  Amounts exclude the Investment Management business segments proportionate share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a minority stake and assets for which fees are not generated. For 2015, amounts include $4.6 billion of inflows related to the transfer of certain portfolio managers and their portfolios from the Wealth Management business segment to the Investment Management business segment.  

 (10)  For a discussion of the Companys net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

 (11)  The impact of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity was $(637) million, $(1,108) million and $(1,057) million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of net discrete tax benefits on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $434 million, $713 million and $146 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

 (12)  The impact of DVA on return on average common equity was 0.7%, 0.7% and (0.6)% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of net discrete tax benefits on return on average common equity was 0.8%, 3.3% and 0.6% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

 (13)  The calculation of return on average tangible common equity equals net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. To determine the return on average tangible common equity, excluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and the denominator were adjusted to exclude the impact of DVA and the impact of net discrete tax benefits. The impact of DVA was 0.8%, 0.9% and (0.8)% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of net discrete tax benefits was 0.9%, 3.9% and 0.8% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

 (14)  Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity of $58,098 million at December 31, 2015 and $55,138 million at December 31, 2014 divided by common shares outstanding of 1,920 million at December 31, 2015 and 1,951 million at December 31, 2014.  

Return on Equity Target.  

The Company is aiming to improve its returns to shareholders, and has established a target of achieving a 9% to 11% return on average common equity excluding DVA (Return on Equity) by 2017, subject to the successful execution of its strategic objectives.  

The Company plans to progress toward achieving its Return on Equity target through the following key elements of its strategy:  

       Revenue and profitability growth:  

       Wealth Management pre-tax margin improvement to approximately 23% to 25% through net interest income growth via continued high quality lending, expense efficiency and business growth;  

       Continued strength in Investment Banking and Equity Sales and Trading results;  

       Steady performance in Investment Management;  

       Expense efficiency:  

       Achieve an expense efficiency target ratio excluding DVA of 74%, assuming a flat revenue environment (not including any outsized litigation expense or penalties);  

       Sufficient capital:  

       Continuing to right-size the Fixed Income and Commodities Sales and Trading business from an operational and capital standpoint; and  

       Increasing capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.  

The Companys Return on Equity target and its related strategies, goals and targets are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many factors including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; legal expenses; capital levels; and discrete tax items. Given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that the Companys Return on Equity target and its related strategies and targets may not be realized. Actual results may differ from goals and targets, and the differences may be material and adverse. Accordingly, the Company cautions that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, for additional information regarding these forward-looking statements.  

Return on Equity, excluding DVA, and pre-tax margin are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company considers to be useful measures to the Companys investors to assess operating performance. The Companys expense efficiency ratio, excluding DVA, represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues, excluding DVA. For 2015, the Companys expense efficiency ratio was 77%, which was calculated as non-interest expenses of $26,660 million divided by net revenues of $34,537 million, which excludes the positive impact of $618 million from DVA. The expense efficiency ratio, excluding DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers useful for investors to assess operating performance.  

Global Market and Economic Conditions.  

During the first half of 2015, global growth was supported by a rebound in the U.S. and firmer growth in the euro zone and the United Kingdom (U.K.) economies, partially offset by sluggishness in major emerging market economies. During the second half of 2015, global growth slowed as a result of the continued sluggishness of emerging market economies, declines  

     45      

Table of Contents 

 in energy prices and the slowdown of Chinas economic growth. Global real gross domestic product growth decelerated in 2015 from 2014. Growth in emerging market economies slowed for a fourth straight year, while growth in developed market economies was steady but sluggish. Notable trends during the year included falling oil and other commodity prices, an appreciating U.S. dollar weighing on global trade flows and increasing policy challenges in a number of major emerging market economies, most notably China. The U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) announced a rate increase in December 2015 based on cumulative labor market progress and rising confidence in achieving its inflation target. However, with Europe and Japan still struggling and China decelerating, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Peoples Bank of China acted to continue their targeted monetary policy easing measures. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the Bank of Japan announced a program of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with a Negative Interest Rate that introduced a three tier policy rate system for bank reserves with a low rate of (0.1)%.  

Business Segments.  

Substantially all of the Companys operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.  

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to its consolidated results.  

Net Revenues.  

Trading. Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as a market maker as well as gains and losses on the Companys related positions and other positions carried at fair value. Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of the Companys positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other positions carried at fair value. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in this line item since they relate to positions carried at fair value. Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in Commissions and fees. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for related services are recorded in Commissions and fees.  

The Company often invests in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge its obligations under its deferred compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in Trading revenues and Investments revenues. Expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in Compensation and benefits. Compensation expense is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. Generally, changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in fair value of the referenced investment will be offset by changes in fair value of the investments made by the Company. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of gains and losses on the Companys investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.  

As a market maker, the Company stands ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. The Companys liquidity obligations can be explicit and obligatory in some cases, and in others, customers expect the Company to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill its market-making function, the Company engages in activities across all of its trading businesses that include, but are not limited to: (i) taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell anddepending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the positionto hold those positions for a period of time; (ii) managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks; (iii) building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engaging in accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand; (iv) trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and (v) engaging in other activities to  

      46     

Table of Contents 

 provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. Although not included in Trading revenues, Interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held by the Company earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell.  

Investments. The Companys investments generally are held for long-term appreciation, or as discussed above, hedging purposes, and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. In some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products. The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of the Companys holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The sales restrictions on the investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in real estate funds, hedge funds and private equity funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time that the Company is clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse. Additionally, there are certain investments related to assets held by consolidated real estate funds, which are primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.  

Commissions and Fees. Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over-the-counter (OTC) equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees in the Wealth Management business segment also include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management. Mutual fund distribution fees in the Wealth Management business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision.  

Asset management fees in the Investment Management business segment arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees in the Investment Management business segment are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.  

Net Interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities; Investment securities, which include available for sale (AFS) securities and held to maturity (HTM) securities; Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell; Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase; Loans; Deposits; Other short-term borrowings; Long-term borrowings; trading strategies; customer activity in the prime brokerage business; and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.  

Net Revenues by Segment.  

Institutional Securities. Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.  

Equity and fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues; Commissions and fees; Asset management, distribution and administration fees; and Net interest income (expense). In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views these net revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions  

     47      

Table of Contents 

 relating to trading are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions, and other related expenses. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information related to gains (losses) on derivative instruments.  

In addition to sales and trading net revenues discussed above, sales and trading net revenues also include other trading revenues, consisting of costs related to liquidity held (negative carry), gains (losses) on economic hedges related to the long-term borrowings and certain activities associated with the corporate lending activities.  

Wealth Management. Net revenues are composed of Transactional, Asset management, Net interest and Other revenues.  

Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees. Investment banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which the Company acts as principal, gains and losses on the Companys inventory positions, which are held primarily to facilitate customer transactions, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Revenues from Commissions and fees primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.  

Asset management revenues include Asset management, distribution and administration fees, and referral fees related to the bank deposit program.  

Net interest income includes interest related to the bank deposit program, interest on AFS securities and HTM securities, interest on lending activities and other net interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. Net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions and bank deposit program activity.  

Other revenues include revenues from the sale of AFS securities, customer account services fees and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Investment Management. The Investment Management business segment generates investment banking revenues primarily from the acquisition of investments in mature real estate and merchant banking funds. Investments revenue primarily consists of real estate and private equity investments that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject to sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.  

For information about the composition of Sales and trading, Investment and Asset management revenues, see Net Revenues herein.  

Compensation Expense.  

Compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. The factors that drive compensation for the Companys employees vary from quarter to quarter, segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, their compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Company, business unit and individual performance. Compensation for the Companys remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (e.g., base salary, benefits, etc.).

Equity and equity-related offerings and fixed income offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or change in the value of a transaction.  

 (2)  Amounts include transactions of $100 million or more. Announced mergers and acquisitions exclude terminated transactions.  

 (3)  Amounts include Rule 144A issuances and registered public offerings of common stock and convertible securities and rights offerings.  

 (4)  Amounts include non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and taxable municipal debt. Amounts include publicly registered and Rule 144A issues. Amounts exclude leveraged loans and self-led issuances.  

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Investment banking revenues of $5,008 million in 2015 decreased 4% from the prior year due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by higher advisory revenues.  

       Advisory revenues increased led primarily by merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions (M&A) in the Americas. Global industry-wide announced M&A volume activity for 2015 increased significantly compared with 2014.  

       Equity underwriting revenues decreased driven by decreases in initial public offering volumes. Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily driven by lower non-investment grade bond and loan fees.  

2014 Compared with 2013.  

Investment banking revenues of $5,203 million in 2014 increased 19% from the prior year driven by increases across both underwriting and advisory revenues.  

       Advisory revenues from M&A increased due to increased deal activity in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. Industry-wide announced M&A volume activity for 2014 increased across all regions compared with 2013, primarily driven by cross-border activity.  

       Equity underwriting revenues increased driven by increased activity with clients across all regions. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased driven by increased investment grade volumes.

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Total sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the initial implementation of FVA, of $11,832 million in 2015 increased 12% from the prior year due to higher equity, fixed income and commodities revenues.  

Equity.   

       Equity sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, increased driven by strong results in prime brokerage and derivatives products. Higher client balances primarily drove the increase in prime brokerage results, while the improved results in derivatives reflected increased client activity and gains on inventory.  

Fixed Income and Commodities.   

       Excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues increased as higher commodity net revenues were partially offset by lower fixed income product results.  

       Fixed income product net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, decreased due to lower results in credit and securitized products from wider credit spread environment which were partially offset by higher revenues in interest rates and foreign exchange products from higher client activity.  

       Commodity net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, increased primarily reflecting higher revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015 (see Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items2015 Compared with 2014Dispositions herein). The increase was partially offset by credit driven losses and the absence of revenues from TransMontaigne Inc., which was sold on July 1, 2014 (see Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items2014 Compared with 2013Dispositions herein).  

2014 Compared with 2013.  

Total sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, of $10,561 million in 2014 increased 1% from the prior year due to higher equity and fixed income and commodities revenues partially offset by higher losses in other sales and trading net revenues.  

Equity.   

       Equity sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA of $2 million, increased primarily due to higher revenues in the prime brokerage business driven by higher client balances partially offset by a decrease in derivatives revenues, reflecting unfavorable volatility movement.  

Fixed Income and Commodities.  

       Fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues in 2014 included a charge of $466 million related to the implementation of FVA. Excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues increased as higher commodity net revenues were partially offset by lower fixed income product results.  

       Fixed income product net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, decreased as higher results in interest rate products were offset by declines in credit products, which reflected an unfavorable market environment.  

       Commodity net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, increased reflecting higher levels of client demand for structured transactions and volatility in natural gas and power partly offset by lower revenues in the oil related businesses in part attributable to TransMontaigne Inc., which was sold on July 1, 2014

Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items.  

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Investments.  

       Net investment gains of $274 million in 2015 increased 14% from the prior year driven by gains on business related investments.  

Other.  

       Other revenues of $221 million in 2015 decreased 68% from the prior year primarily due to the absence of gains realized on certain assets sold in 2014 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and markdowns and provisions on loans held for sale and held for investment, respectively.  

Non-interest Expenses.  

Non-interest expenses of $13,282 million in 2015 decreased 22% from the prior year driven by a 25% reduction in Non-compensation expenses and a 17% reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses decreased primarily due to lower litigation expenses.  

Income Tax Items.  

In 2015, the Company recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the Companys legal entity organization in the U.K.  

Dispositions.  

On November 1, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton Commodities International LLC. The loss on sale of approximately $71 million was recognized in Other revenues.  

2014 Compared with 2013.  

Investments.   

       Net investment gains of $240 million in 2014 decreased 66% from the prior year reflecting a gain recorded in 2013 related to the disposition of an investment in an insurance broker, and lower gains on principal investments and investments associated with the deferred compensation and co-investment plans in 2014.  

Other.  

       Other revenues of $684 million remained unchanged. The results in 2014 included lower income from the Companys 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (MUMSS) compared with 2013 (see Other ItemsJapanese Securities Joint Venture herein and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in  

     53      

Table of Contents 

     Item 8). In 2014, Other revenues also included gains realized on certain assets sold (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

Non-interest Expenses.   

Non-interest expenses of $16,929 million in 2014 increased 16% from the prior year primarily due to higher legal expenses and higher compensation expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions and an increase in base salaries and fixed allowances partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to higher legal expenses related to certain legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis-related matters (see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresLegal herein and ContingenciesLegal in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

Income Tax Items.  

In 2014, the Company recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $839 million. This included net discrete tax benefits of: $612 million principally associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. In addition, the Companys Provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the business segment was impacted by approximately $900 million of tax provision as a result of non-deductible expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters.  

In 2013, the Company recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $407 million. This included net discrete tax benefits of: $161 million related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest associated with new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; $92 million related to the establishment of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset from a legal entity reorganization; $73 million that is attributable to tax planning strategies to optimize foreign tax credit utilization as a result of the anticipated repatriation of earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries; and $81 million due to the retroactive effective date of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Relief Act). For a further discussion of the Relief Act, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

Dispositions.  

On July 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its ownership stake in TransMontaigne Inc., a U.S.-based oil storage, marketing and transportation company, as well as related physical inventory and the assumption of its obligations under certain terminal storage contracts, to NGL Energy Partners LP. The gain on sale of $112 million is recorded in Other revenues.  

On March 27, 2014, the Company completed the sale of Canterm Canadian Terminals Inc., a public storage terminal operator for refined products with two distribution terminals in Canada. The gain on sale was approximately $45 million and is recorded in Other revenues.

Transactional Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Transactional revenues of $3,335 million in 2015 decreased 14% from the prior year due to lower revenues in each of Trading, Investment banking and Commissions and fees.  

       Investment banking revenues decreased primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of underwritten offerings.  

       Trading revenues decreased primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and lower revenues from fixed income products.  

       Commissions and fees decreased primarily due to lower revenues from equity, mutual fund and annuity products partially offset by higher revenues from alternatives asset classes.  

2014 Compared with 2013.  

Transactional revenues of $3,875 million in 2014 decreased 10% from the prior year due to lower revenues in each of Trading, Investment banking and Commissions and fees.  

       Investment banking revenues decreased primarily due to lower levels of underwriting activity in closed-end funds partially offset by higher revenues from structured products.  

       Trading revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and lower revenues from fixed income products.  

       Commissions and fees revenues decreased primarily due to lower equity, insurance and mutual fund activity.  

Net Revenues.  

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Asset Management.  

       Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,536 million in 2015 increased 2% from the prior year primarily due to higher fee-based revenues that resulted from positive flows and higher average market values over 2015 as compared with the average market values during 2014 (see Statistical Data herein). The increase in fee-based revenues was partially offset by lower referral fees from the bank deposit program, reflecting the completion of the transfer of the deposits from Citigroup Inc. (Citi) to the Company (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

Net Interest.  

       Net interest of $2,956 million in 2015 increased 26% from the prior year primarily due to higher balances in the bank deposit program and growth in loans and lending commitments.  

     57      

Table of Contents 

Other.  

       Other revenues of $255 million in 2015 decreased 20% from the prior year primarily due to a $40 million gain on sale of a retail property space in the prior year and an increase in the allowance for credit losses in 2015.  

Non-interest Expenses.   

Non-interest expenses of $11,768 million in 2015 decreased 1% from the prior year primarily due to lower Compensation and benefit expenses partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to an increase in Professional services, resulting from increased consulting and legal fees partially offset by a provision related to a rescission offer in the prior year. Other expenses in 2014 included $50 million related to a rescission offer to Wealth Management clients who may not have received a prospectus for certain securities transactions, for which delivery of a prospectus was required.  

2014 Compared with 2013.  

Net Revenues.  

Asset Management.  

       Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,345 million in 2014 increased 10% from the prior year primarily due to higher fee-based revenues partially offset by lower revenues from referral fees from the bank deposit program. The referral fees for deposits placed with Citi-affiliated depository institutions declined to $81 million in 2014 from $240 million in 2013, reflecting the transfer of deposits to the Company from Citi.  

Net Interest.  

       Net interest of $2,339 million in 2014 increased 25% from the prior year primarily due to higher lending balances and growth in loans and lending commitments in Portfolio Loan Account (PLA) securities-based lending products.  

Other.

Non-interest Expenses.  

Non-interest expenses of $11,903 million in 2014 increased 3% from the prior year primarily due to higher Compensation and benefit expenses partially offset by lower Non-compensation expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to a higher formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives linked to higher net revenues and an increase in base salaries.  

       Non-compensation expenses decreased in 2014 primarily driven by technology write-offs and an impairment expense related to certain intangible assets (management contracts) associated with alternative investments funds in 2013, lower intangible amortization and a lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assessment on deposits partially offset by a provision in 2014 related to a rescission offer to Wealth Management clients.

Income Tax Items.

See Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresU.S. Bank Subsidiaries Lending Activities herein and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit RiskLending Activities in Item 7A.  

Fee-Based Client Assets.  

Wealth Management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of fee-based client assets related to certain account types that are offered to Wealth Management clients. These fees, which the Company records in the Asset management, distribution and administrative fees line on its income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the client participates and are generally not driven by asset class. For most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the end of the prior quarter. Across the account types, the fees will vary based on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in Wealth Management.

2015 Compared with 2014.  

Net Revenues.  

Investments.   

       Investments of $249 million in 2015 decreased 58% from the prior year reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest associated with Asia Private Equity and additional net markdowns on principal investments.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.   

       Asset management, distribution and administration fees were unchanged from the prior year as the impact of positive net flows was offset by a shift in the asset class mix from equity and fixed income products to liquidity products, (see Statistical Data herein).  

Other.  

       Other revenues of $32 million in 2015 decreased 70% from the prior year due to lower revenues associated with the Companys minority investment in certain third-party investment managers.  

Non-interest Expenses.   

Non-interest expenses of $1,823 million in 2015 decreased 11% from the prior year primarily due to lower Compensation and benefit expenses partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in deferred compensation associated with carried interest and a decrease in the level of incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to higher Brokerage and clearing, Professional services, resulting from higher consulting and legal fees and Information processing and communications expenses.  

2014 Compared with 2013.  

Trading.  

       Trading losses of $19 million in 2014 compared with gains of $41 million in 2013 primarily reflected losses related to certain consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company.  

Investments.   

       Investments of $587 million in 2014 decreased 44% from the prior year primarily related to lower net investment gains, lower carried interest in the Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing businesses and lower gains from investments in the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. 2014 results were also negatively impacted by the deconsolidation in the second quarter of 2014 of certain legal entities associated with a real estate fund sponsored by the Company.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.   

       Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $2,049 million in 2014 increased 7% from the prior year primarily reflected higher management and administration revenues as a result of higher average assets under management (AUM), (see Statistical Data herein).  

Other.  

       Other revenues of $106 million in 2014 increased from $32 million in 2013 primarily due to higher revenues associated with the Companys minority investment in certain third-party investment managers and a $17 million gain on sale of a retail property space.

Non-interest Expenses.   

Non-interest expenses of $2,048 million were essentially unchanged from 2013.  

       Compensation and benefits expenses increased due to the 2014 compensation actions and increases in salaries partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).  

       Non-compensation expenses decreased primarily due to an impairment expense related to certain intangible assets (management contracts) associated with alternative investments funds in 2013 and the result of lower consumption taxes in the European Union.  

Other Items.  

Nonredeemable Noncontrolling Interests.   

Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests are primarily related to the consolidation of certain real estate funds sponsored by the Company. Investment gains (losses) associated with nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in these consolidated funds were $14 million, $104 million and $151 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests decreased in 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain legal entities associated with a real estate fund sponsored by the Company in the second quarter 2015.

Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures.  

Legal.  

The Company incurred legal expenses of $563 million in 2015, $3,364 million in 2014 and $1,941 million in 2013. Legal expenses are included in Other expenses in the consolidated statements of income.  

Legal expenses incurred in 2015 were primarily related to increases in reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap antitrust litigation matter and for legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters. The legal expenses incurred in 2014 and 2013 were principally due to reserve additions and settlements related to legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis related matters, including in 2014 the Companys $2,600 million agreement with the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division, which was reached on February 25, 2015 and finalized on February 10, 2016 (see ContingenciesLegal in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

The Companys future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Company.  

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.  

The Company provides loans to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals, primarily through its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The lending activities in the Institutional Securities business segment include corporate lending activities, in which the Company provides loans or lending commitments to certain corporate clients, and other lending activities. The lending activities in the Wealth Management business segment primarily include securities-based lending that allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities and also include residential real estate loans. The Company expects its lending activities to continue to grow through further penetration of the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments client base. For a further discussion of credit risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk in Item 7A. Also see Notes 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about loans and lending commitments, respectively.

Income Tax Matters.  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 25.9% for 2015. Included in this rate were net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the legal entity organization in the U.K. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 would have been 32.5%, which is reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations was a benefit of 2.5% for 2014. Included in this rate were net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million. These net discrete tax benefits consisted of: $1,380 million primarily due to the release of a deferred tax liability, previously established as part of the acquisition of Smith Barney in 2009 through a charge to Additional paid-in capital, as a result of the legal entity restructuring that included a change in tax status of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC from a partnership to a corporation; $609 million principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 would have been 59.5%, which is primarily attributable to approximately $900 million of tax provision from non-deductible expenses for litigation and regulatory matters.  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 19.8% for 2013. Included in this rate were net discrete tax benefits of $407 million. These net discrete tax benefits consisted of: $161 million related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; $92 million related to the establishment of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset from a legal entity reorganization; $73 million attributable to tax planning strategies to optimize foreign tax credit utilization as a result of the anticipated repatriation of earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries; and $81 million due to the enactment of the Relief Act, which retroactively extended a provision of U.S. tax law that defers the imposition of tax on certain active financial services income of certain foreign subsidiaries earned outside the U.S. until such income is repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2013 would have been 28.7%, which is reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.  

Discretionary Incentive Compensation.  

On December 1, 2014, the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee (CMDS Committee) of the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) approved an approach for awards of discretionary incentive compensation for the 2014 performance year to be granted in 2015 that would reduce the average deferral of such awards to an approximate baseline of 50%. Additionally, the CMDS Committee approved the acceleration of vesting for certain outstanding deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards. The deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards subject to accelerated vesting will be distributed on their regularly scheduled future distribution dates and will continue to be subject to cancellation and clawback provisions. The following table presents the increase in Compensation and benefits expense for the Company and each of the business segments as a result of these actions in 2014 (2014 compensation actions).

Accounting Development Updates.  

Thus far in 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued the following accounting update, which applies to the Company:  

       Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for a specific component in the accounting standard, in which the Company would present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the Company has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments (i.e., DVA). This accounting update is currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption.  

During 2015 and 2014, the FASB issued the following accounting updates, which apply to the Company, but they are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements:  

       Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  

       Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  

       Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  

       Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity.  

       Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  

       Measuring the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity.  

       Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  

During 2014, the FASB also issued the following accounting update:  

       Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting update to clarify the principles of revenue recognition, to develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and to provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On April 1, 2015, the FASB voted to propose a deferral of the effective date of this accounting update by one year to January 1, 2018. Additionally, the FASB permits an entity to adopt this accounting update early but not before the original effective date, beginning January 1, 2017. This accounting update is currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption.

Critical Accounting Policies.  

The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  

Fair Value.  

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value.   

A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value. The Company makes estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:  

       Trading assets and Trading liabilities;  

       AFS securities;  

       Securities received as collateral and Obligation to return securities received as collateral;  

       Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;  

       Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;  

       Certain Short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes;  

       Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;  

       Certain Other secured financings; and  

       Certain Long-term borrowings, primarily structured notes.  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  

In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 uses valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the valuation process, fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

The Company incorporates FVA into the fair value measurements of OTC uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received.  

For a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Company, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

     71      

Table of Contents 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis.  

At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, certain of the Companys assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs, intangible assets, other assets and other liabilities, and accrued expenses. The Company incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.  

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  

Fair Value Control Processes.   

The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable.  

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding the Companys valuation policies, processes and procedures.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.  

Goodwill.  

The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. For both the annual and interim tests, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  

If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required.  

The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques the Company believes market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of the Companys reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.  

      72     

Table of Contents 

Intangible Assets.  

Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.  

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.  

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies.  

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution.  

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.  

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Company, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Company accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. For certain legal proceedings and investigations, the Company can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.  

Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.  

See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.  

Income Taxes.  

The Company is subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different  

     73      

Table of Contents 

 interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting for unrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.  

The Companys provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. The Companys deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The Companys deferred tax balances also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. The Company performs regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, the Company may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount of these balances (net of valuation allowance) that the Company estimates it is more likely than not to realize at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes could reflect adjustments related to the Companys unrecognized tax benefits.  

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.  

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Companys significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Companys tax examinations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

The Companys senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. The Treasury Department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset and Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated statements of financial condition, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Boards Risk Committee.  

The Balance Sheet.  

The Company monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet on a regular basis. The Companys balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific limits, monitoring of business-specific usage versus limits, key metrics and new business impact assessments.  

The Company establishes balance sheet limits at the consolidated, business segment and business unit levels. The Company monitors balance sheet usage versus limits and reviews variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. On a regular basis, the Company reviews current performance versus limits and assesses the need to re-allocate limits based on business unit needs. The Company also monitors key metrics, including asset and liability size, composition of the balance sheet, limit utilization and capital usage.  

Total Assets for the Companys Business Segments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

     75      

Table of Contents [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Other assets primarily includes Other investments; Premises, equipment and software costs; Goodwill; Intangible assets and deferred tax assets.  

A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in managing the size of its balance sheet. Total assets decreased to $787 billion at December 31, 2015 from $802 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to reductions in Trading assets within the Institutional Securities business segment (primarily within Fixed Income and Commodities), partially offset by balance sheet growth related to higher Deposits, which were redeployed into lending activity and excess cash and liquidity and by an increase in secured funding to support the Equity business within the Institutional Securities business segment.  

Securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

Collateralized Financing Transactions and Average Balances.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Period-end balances for Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned at December 31, 2015 were lower than the average balances during 2015. The balances moved in line with client financing activity and with general movements in firm inventory.  

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed period-end balances at December 31, 2014 were lower than the average balances during 2014 due to a reduction in client financing activity and an increase in financing balance sheet efficiencies. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned period-end balances at December 31, 2014 were lower than the average balances during 2014 as the Companys assets decreased.  

Securities financing assets and liabilities also include matched book transactions with minimal market, credit and/or liquidity risk. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions includes customer margin loans,  

      76     

Table of Contents 

 collateralized by customer-owned securities, and customer cash, which is segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to the Companys prime brokerage customers. The Companys risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit the Companys credit exposure to customers. Included within securities financing assets were $11 billion and $21 billion at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, recorded in accordance with accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets that represented offsetting assets and liabilities for fully collateralized non-cash loan transactions.  

Liquidity Risk Management Framework.  

The primary goal of the Companys Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that the Company has access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions. The framework is designed to enable the Company to fulfill its financial obligations and support the execution of its business strategies.  

The following principles guide the Companys Liquidity Risk Management Framework:  

       Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;  

       Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;  

       Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and  

       Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.  

The core components of the Companys Liquidity Risk Management are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the Global Liquidity Reserve (as defined below), which support its target liquidity profile.  

Required Liquidity Framework.  

The Companys Required Liquidity Framework reflects the amount of liquidity the Company must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that its financial condition and overall soundness is not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.  

Liquidity Stress Tests.  

The Company uses Liquidity Stress Tests to model liquidity inflows and outflows across multiple scenarios over a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of the Companys Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework.  

The assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests include, but are not limited to, the following:  

       No government support;  

       No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;  

       Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;  

       Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding;  

       Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;  

       Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;  

     77      

Table of Contents 

       Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;  

       Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties;  

       Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions;  

       Limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets; and  

       Maturity roll-off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance.  

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced for the Parent and major operating subsidiaries, as well as at major currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Company, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent and that the Parent will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, the Company takes into consideration the settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.  

At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in its Liquidity Stress Tests.  

Global Liquidity Reserve.  

The Company maintains sufficient liquidity reserves (Global Liquidity Reserve) to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the Global Liquidity Reserve is actively managed by the Company. The following components are considered in sizing the Global Liquidity Reserve: unsecured debt maturity profile, balance sheet size and composition, funding needs in a stressed environment inclusive of contingent cash outflows, regional and segment liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements and collateral requirements. In addition, the Companys Global Liquidity Reserve includes a discretionary surplus based on risk tolerance and is subject to change dependent on market and firm-specific events.

Global Liquidity Reserve Managed by Bank and Non-Bank Legal Entities.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The Company calculates the average Global Liquidity Reserve based upon daily amounts.  

 (2)  The Parent managed $54,810 million and $55,094 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and averaged $53,620 million and $56,501 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Regulatory Liquidity Framework.  

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) has developed two standards intended for use in liquidity risk supervision: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).  

Liquidity Coverage Ratio.   

The LCR was developed to ensure banking organizations have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days. This standards objective is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations.  

The final rule to implement the LCR in the U.S. (U.S. LCR) applies to the Company and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and each is required to calculate its respective U.S. LCR on each business day. As of January 1, 2015, the Company and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries were required to maintain a minimum U.S. LCR of 80%. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the Company and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum U.S. LCR of 90%, and this minimum standard will reach the fully phased-in level of 100% beginning on January 1, 2017. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed rules that would require large banking organizations, including the Company, to publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about their U.S. LCR beginning in the third quarter of 2016. The Company is compliant with the minimum required U.S. LCR based on current interpretation and continues to evaluate its impact on the Companys liquidity and funding requirements.  

Net Stable Funding Ratio.   

The objective of the NSFR is to reduce funding risk over a one-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress. In October 2014, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the NSFR. The U.S. banking regulators are expected to issue a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The Company continues to evaluate the NSFR and its potential impact on the Companys current liquidity and funding requirements.  

Funding Management.  

The Company manages its funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of its liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.  

     79      

Table of Contents 

The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include the Companys equity capital, long-term debt, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), securities lending, deposits, commercial paper, letters of credit and lines of credit. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.  

Secured Financing.   

A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and arises principally from the Institutional Securities business segments sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in funding these assets with secured financing. The Companys goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, the Company actively manages its secured financing book based on the quality of the assets being funded.  

The Company utilizes shorter-term secured financing only for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. The Company defines highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the weighted average maturity of the Companys secured financing of less liquid assets was greater than 120 days. To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, the Company has established concentration limits to diversify its investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, the Company obtains term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory, or spare capacity, as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or its ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, the Company holds a portion of its Global Liquidity Reserve against the potential disruption to its secured financing capabilities.  

The Company also maintains a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which provide a valuable future source of liquidity. With the implementation of U.S. Basel III liquidity standards, the Company has also incorporated high-quality liquid asset classifications that are consistent with the U.S. LCR definitions into its encumbrance reporting, which further substantiates the demonstrated liquidity characteristics of the unencumbered asset pool and its ability to readily identify new funding sources for such assets.  

Unsecured Financing.   

The Company views long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding. Unencumbered securities and non-security assets are financed with a combination of long-term and short-term debt and deposits. The Companys unsecured financings include structured borrowings, whose payments and redemption values are based on the performance of certain underlying assets, including equity, credit, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities. When appropriate, the Company may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to its interest rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

Deposits.  

Available funding sources to the Companys bank subsidiaries include time deposits, money market deposit accounts, demand deposit accounts, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The vast majority of deposits in the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are sourced from its retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. The transfer of deposits previously held by Citi to the Companys depository institutions relating to the Companys customer accounts was completed on June 30, 2015. During 2015, $8.7 billion of deposits were transferred by Citi to the Companys depository institutions.

 (2)  Certain time deposit accounts are carried at fair value under the fair value option (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

 (3)  The Companys deposits were primarily held in the U.S.  

Short-Term Borrowings.   

The Companys unsecured Short-term borrowings may consist of bank loans, bank notes, commercial paper and structured notes with maturities of 12 months or less at issuance. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $2,173 million and $2,261 million, respectively, in Short-term borrowings.  

Long-Term Borrowings.   

The Company believes that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of long-term debt allows the Company to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Long-term borrowings are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, its credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.  

The Company may engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt retirements) that it believes are in the best interests of the Company and its investors.  

Long-term Borrowings by Maturity Profile.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2015, the Company issued notes with a principal amount of approximately $34.2 billion. In connection with these note issuances, the Company generally enters into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates. The weighted average maturity of the Companys long-term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 6.1 years at December 31, 2015. During 2015, approximately $27.3 billion in aggregate long-term borrowings matured or were retired. Subsequent to December 31, 2015 and through February 19, 2016, long-term borrowings increased by approximately $5.2 billion, net of maturities and repayments. This amount includes the issuance of $5.5 billion of senior debt on January 27, 2016 and $400 million of senior debt on February 17, 2016. For a further discussion of the Companys long-term borrowings, including the amount of senior debt outstanding at December 31, 2015, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

During 2015, Morgan Stanley Capital Trusts VI and VII redeemed all of their issued and outstanding 6.60% Capital Securities, respectively, and the Company concurrently redeemed the related underlying junior subordinated debentures.

Capital Covenants.  

In April 2007, the Company executed replacement capital covenants in connection with an offering by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII Capital Securities, which become effective after the scheduled redemption date in 2046. Under the terms of the replacement capital covenants, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of certain specified holders of debt, to limitations on its ability to redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities for specified periods of time. For a complete description of the Capital Securities and the terms of the replacement capital covenants, see the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 26, 2007.  

Credit Ratings.  

The Company relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by, among other things, the Companys credit ratings. In addition, the Companys credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Rating agencies consider company-specific factors; other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes; the macroeconomic environment; and perceived levels of government support, among other things.  

As of December 2, 2015, the Companys credit ratings no longer incorporate uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of the U.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Meanwhile, some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from non-governmental third-party sources of potential support.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  On May 19, 2015, Fitch Ratings, Inc. upgraded the long-term rating of MSBNA by one notch to A+ from A. The rating outlook remained Stable.  

 (2)  On May 28, 2015, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) upgraded the long-term rating of the Parent and MSBNA by two notches to A3 from Baa2 and A1 from A3, respectively. The rating outlook for the Parent and MSBNA was revised to Stable.  

 (3)  On November 6, 2015, Rating and Investment Information, Inc. downgraded the long-term rating of the Parent one-notch to A- from A. The rating outlook for the Parent was revised to Stable.  

 (4)  On December 2, 2015, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) downgraded the rating of the non-operating holding companies of all eight U.S. global systemically important banks by removing the government support uplift from the rating based on S&Ps view that it is uncertain that the U.S. government would provide extraordinary support to its banking system given S&Ps review of the progress made toward putting in place a viable U.S. resolution plan. The Parents long-term rating was lowered by one-notch to BBB+ from A-. The rating outlook for the Parent was revised to Stable. On November 2, 2015, MSBNAs rating outlook was revised to Positive Watch from Positive.  

In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements where the Company is a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, the Company may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether the Company is in a net asset or net liability position.  

The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moodys and S&P. The table below shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios, from the lowest of Moodys or S&P ratings, based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments upon Potential Future Rating Downgrade.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on the Companys business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among others, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions the Company might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in the Companys Liquidity Stress Tests.  

Capital Management.  

The Companys senior management views capital as an important source of financial strength. The Company actively manages its consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries required equity.  

In March 2015, the Company received no objection from the Federal Reserve to its 2015 capital plan. The capital plan included a share repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock during the period that began April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. Additionally, the capital plan included an increase in the Companys quarterly common stock dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.10 per share that began with the dividend declared on April 20, 2015. During 2015 and 2014, the Company repurchased approximately $2,125 million and $900 million, respectively, of its outstanding common stock as part of its share repurchase program (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Pursuant to the share repurchase program, the Company considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases under the Companys program will be exercised from time to time at prices the Company deems appropriate subject to various factors, including its capital position and market conditions. The share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. Share repurchases by the Company are subject to regulatory approval (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5).  

The Board determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. The cash dividends declared on the Companys outstanding preferred stock were $452 million, $311 million and $271 million for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On January 19, 2016, the Company announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.15. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2016 to common shareholders of record on January 29, 2016 (see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).  

Issuance of Preferred Stock.  

Series J Preferred Stock. On March 19, 2015, the Company issued 1,500,000 Depositary Shares for an aggregate price of $1,500 million. Each Depositary Share represents a 1/25th interest in a share of perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J, $0.01 par value (Series J Preferred Stock). The Series J Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Companys option (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after July 15, 2020 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as described in the terms of that series), in each case at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series J Preferred Stock also has a preference over the Companys common

 stock upon liquidation. The Series J Preferred Stock offering (net of related issuance costs) resulted in proceeds of approximately $1,493 million.  

On December 15, 2015, the Company announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend for preferred stock shareholders of record on December 31, 2015, that was paid on January 15, 2016.

Regulatory Requirements.  

Regulatory Capital Framework.  

The Company is a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates its compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.  

Implementation of U.S. Basel III.  

The U.S. banking regulators have comprehensively revised their risk-based and leverage capital framework to implement many aspects of the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee. The U.S. banking regulators revised capital framework is referred to herein as U.S. Basel III. The Company and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2014. Aspects of U.S. Basel III, such as the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, new capital buffers, and certain deductions from and adjustments to capital, are being phased in over several years.  

Regulatory Capital. U.S. Basel III, which is aimed at increasing the quality and amount of regulatory capital, establishes Common Equity Tier 1 capital as a new tier of capital, increases minimum required risk-based capital ratios, provides for capital buffers above those minimum ratios, provides for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, modifies methods for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWAs)the denominator of risk-based capital ratiosby, among other things, increasing counterparty credit risk capital requirements, and introduces a supplementary leverage ratio. In addition, new items (including certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions) are deducted from the respective tiers of regulatory capital, and certain existing regulatory deductions and adjustments are modified or are no longer applicable. The majority of these capital deductions are subject to a phase-in schedule and will be fully phased in by 2018. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities are reflected in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to a phase-in schedule. The percentage of the regulatory deductions and adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 capital that applied to the Company in 2015 generally ranged from 40% to 100%, depending on the specific item.  

In addition, U.S. Basel III narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. Existing trust preferred securities are required to be fully phased out of the Companys Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016. Thereafter, existing trust preferred securities that do not satisfy U.S. Basel IIIs eligibility criteria for Tier 2 capital will be phased out of the Companys regulatory capital by January 1, 2022.  

The deductions that the Volcker Rule requires to be made from a bank holding companys Tier 1 capital for certain permissible investments in covered funds are reflected in the relevant regulatory capital tiers and ratios beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2015 (see also BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyActivities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule in Part I, Item 1).  

Risk-Weighted Assets. The Company is required to calculate and hold capital against credit, market and operational risk RWAs. RWAs reflect both on- and off-balance sheet risk of the Company. Credit risk RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from a borrower, counterparty or issuer failing to meet its financial obligations to the Company. Market risk RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and other factors. Operational risk RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external events (e.g., fraud; theft; legal, regulatory and compliance risks; or damage to physical assets). The Company may incur operational risks across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue-generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and support and control groups (e.g., information technology and trade processing). In addition, given the evolving regulatory and litigation environment across the financial services industry and the fact that operational risk RWAs incorporate the impact of such related matters, operational risk RWAs may increase in future periods. For a further discussion of the Companys market, credit and operational risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A.  

     85      

Table of Contents 

The Basel Committee is in the process of considering revisions to various provisions of the Basel III framework that, if adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, could result in substantial changes to U.S. Basel III. In particular, the Basel Committee has finalized a new methodology for calculating counterparty credit risk exposures in derivatives transactions, the standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures, and revised frameworks for market risk and securitization capital requirements. In addition, the Basel Committee has proposed revisions to various regulatory capital standards, including for credit risk, operational risk and interest rate risk in the banking book. In each case, the impact of these revised standards on the Company and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. banking agencies.  

Calculation of Risk-Based Capital Ratios. On February 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve and the OCC approved the Companys and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries respective use of the U.S. Basel III advanced internal ratings-based approach for determining credit risk capital requirements and advanced measurement approaches for determining operational risk capital requirements to calculate and publicly disclose their risk-based capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014, subject to the capital floor discussed below (the Advanced Approach). As a U.S. Basel III Advanced Approach banking organization, the Company is required to compute risk-based capital ratios calculated using both (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk RWAs and market risk RWAs (the Standardized Approach); and (ii) an advanced internal ratings-based approach for calculating credit risk RWAs, an advanced measurement approach for calculating operational risk RWAs, and an advanced approach for calculating market risk RWAs under U.S. Basel III.  

To implement a provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), U.S. Basel III subjects Advanced Approach banking organizations that have been approved by their regulators to exit the parallel run, such as the Company, to a permanent capital floor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, as a result of the capital floor, the Companys binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under the Advanced Approach or the Standardized Approach under U.S. Basel III. The U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach modifies certain U.S. Basel I-based methods for calculating RWAs and prescribes new standardized risk weights for certain types of assets and exposures. The capital floor applies to the calculation of the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the capital conservation buffer, the countercyclical capital buffer (if deployed by banking regulators) and the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) capital surcharge.  

The methods for calculating each of the Companys risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1, 2022 as aspects of U.S. Basel III are phased in. These ongoing methodological changes may result in differences in the Companys reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of changes to its capital base, asset composition, off-balance sheet exposures or risk profile.

 (1)  Beginning in 2018, U.S. Basel III rules defining capital (numerator of capital ratios) will be fully phased in, except for the exclusion of non-qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 2 capital, which will be fully phased in as of January 1, 2022. In addition, the Company will also be subject to a greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, a G-SIB capital surcharge and, if deployed by banking regulators, up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical buffer, all of which will be fully phased in by the beginning of 2019. The capital conservation buffer, the G-SIB capital surcharge and, if deployed, the countercyclical buffer apply in addition to each of the Companys Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios. The requirements for these additional capital buffers will be phased in beginning in 2016. For information on the recently adopted G-SIB capital surcharge, see G-SIB Capital Surcharge herein.  

 (2)  In 2015, as a result of the Companys and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries completion of the Advanced Approach parallel run, the amount of expected credit loss that exceeds eligible credit reserves must be deducted 40% from Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 60% from Additional Tier 1 capital. Over the next two years, this deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 capital will incrementally increase and the amount deducted from Additional Tier 1 capital will correspondingly decrease until fully phased in by the beginning of 2018. In addition, under the Advanced Approach framework, the allowance for loan losses cannot be included in Tier 2 capital. Instead, an Advanced Approach banking organization may include in Tier 2 capital any eligible credit reserves that exceed its total expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserve amount does not exceed 0.6% of its Advanced Approach credit risk RWAs. The allowance for loan losses may continue to be included in Tier 2 capital for purposes of calculating capital ratios under the Standardized Approach, up to 1.25% of credit risk RWAs.  

 (3)  In accordance with U.S. Basel III, adjusted average assets represent the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and are composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets under U.S. GAAP during the calendar quarter, adjusted for disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.  

Regulatory Capital Ratios.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

N/ANot Applicable.  

For the Company to remain a financial holding company, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must qualify as well-capitalized under the higher capital requirements of U.S. Basel III by maintaining a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for financial holding companies to reflect the higher capital standards in U.S. Basel III. Assuming that the Federal Reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to financial holding companies, each of the Companys risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio at December 31, 2015 would have exceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require the Company and its peer financial holding companies to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financial holding companys particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.  

At December 31, 2015, the Companys capital ratios calculated under the U.S. Basel III Advanced Approach were lower than those calculated under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and, therefore, are the binding ratios for the Company as a result of the capital floor. At December 31, 2014, the Companys capital ratios calculated under the U.S. Basel III Advanced Approach were lower than those calculated under the Standardized Approach, represented as the U.S. banking regulators U.S. Basel I-based rules (U.S. Basel I) as supplemented by rules that implemented the Basel Committees market risk capital framework amendment, commonly referred to as Basel 2.5 and, therefore, are the binding ratios.

Pro Forma Estimates under the Fully Phased-in U.S. Basel III Advanced and Standardized Approaches.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Includes the applicable minimum risk-based capital ratio and capital conservation buffer and assumes that: (1) the G-SIB capital surcharge for the Company remains at 3% as calculated by the Federal Reserve in July 2015; and (2) no countercyclical buffer has been deployed.  

     91

These fully phased-in basis pro forma estimates are based on the Companys current understanding of U.S. Basel III and other factors, which may be subject to change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance from the Federal Reserve relating to U.S. Basel III and as the interpretation of the regulation evolves over time. The fully phased-in basis pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 capital, RWAs and Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio estimates are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company considers to be useful measures for evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that were not yet effective at December 31, 2015. These preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially and should not be taken as a projection of what the Companys capital ratios, RWAs, earnings or other results will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the Company, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.  

The Company is subject to the following minimum capital ratios under U.S. Basel III: Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%; Total capital ratio of 8.0%; and Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. In addition, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, the Company will be subject to a greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer and, if deployed by banking regulators, up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical buffer. The capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, if any, apply over each of the Companys Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios. Failure to maintain such buffers will result in restrictions on the Companys ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The Company is also subject to the G-SIB capital surcharge, which augments the capital conservation buffer (see G-SIB Capital Surcharge herein), and a supplementary leverage ratio (see Supplementary Leverage Ratio herein).  

G-SIB Capital Surcharge.  

In July 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule imposing risk-based capital surcharges on U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as G-SIBs, which include the Company. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIBs size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee. The second method uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The Federal Reserve has stated that, under the final rule and using the most recent available data, the estimated G-SIB surcharges will range from 1.0% to 4.5% of a GSIBs RWAs. The Federal Reserve calculated the Companys G-SIB surcharge at 3% in July 2015. The surcharge will be phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, and the phase-in amount for 2016 is 25% of the applicable surcharge (see Pro Forma Regulatory Capital Ratios herein).  

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt Requirements.  

The Federal Reserve has issued a proposed rule for top-tier bank holding companies of U.S. G-SIBs (covered BHCs), including the Company, that establishes external total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt (LTD) requirements. The proposal contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be unsecured, have a remaining maturity of at least one year, and not have derivative-linked features, such as structured notes.  

Under the proposal, a covered BHC would be required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of 16% of RWAs and 9.5% of its U.S. Basel III total leverage exposure (the denominator of its supplementary leverage ratio) by January 1, 2019, increasing to the greater of 18% of RWAs and 9.5% of its U.S. Basel III total leverage exposure by January 1, 2022. In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of 6% of RWAs plus the Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Company, and 4.5% of its U.S. Basel III total leverage exposure.  

In addition, the proposed rule would impose a TLAC buffer on top of the external TLAC requirement. The TLAC buffer must be composed solely of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and the same Common Equity Tier 1 capital that is used to satisfy the capital conservation buffer, the G-SIB surcharge, and the countercyclical buffer, if any, under U.S. Basel III may be used to satisfy the TLAC buffer. The required buffer amount would be equal to the sum of 2.5%, the Method 1 G-SIB  

      92     

Table of Contents 

 surcharge applicable to the Company and any applicable countercyclical buffer. Failure to maintain the full TLAC buffer would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  

The proposal would also impose restrictions on certain liabilities that covered BHCs may incur or have outstanding, including structured notes, as well as require all U.S. banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve with assets of at least $1 billion to make certain deductions from capital for their investments in unsecured debt issued by covered BHCs. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact of these proposed requirements. The steps that the covered BHCs, including the Company, may need to take to come into compliance with the final TLAC rules, including the amount and form of LTD that must be refinanced or issued, will depend in substantial part on the ultimate eligibility requirements for senior LTD and any grandfathering provisions in the final rules.  

The main purpose of the Federal Reserves proposed minimum TLAC and LTD requirements is to ensure that covered BHCs, including the Company, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where the single point of entry (SPOE) resolution strategy is used. This strategy can be used under either the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act or the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and is being adopted by both U.S. resolution authorities and by resolution authorities in other countries. As with other major financial companies, the combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the TLAC proposal to facilitate the orderly resolution of G-SIBs is that the groups losses will likely be imposed on the holders of eligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the top-tier bank holding company before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the groups operating subsidiaries or put U.S. taxpayers at risk (see BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning in Part I, Item 1 and Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk in Part I, Item 1A).  

Capital Plans and Stress Tests.   

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including the Company, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework.  

The Company must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Company and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess the Companys systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain its internal capital adequacy. The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases), and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact the bank holding companys consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how the bank holding company will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the U.S. Basel III requirements that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including the Company.  

In November 2015, the Federal Reserve amended its capital plan and stress test rules, with effect from January 1, 2016, to delay until 2017 the use of the supplementary leverage ratio requirement, defer indefinitely the use of the Advanced Approach risk-based capital framework in capital planning and company-run stress tests, and incorporate the Tier 1 capital deductions for certain investments in Volcker Rule covered funds into the pro forma minimum capital requirements for capital plan and stress testing purposes. In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it is considering whether and, if so, how to incorporate the G-SIB capital surcharge in the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act stress tests.  

The capital plan rule requires that large bank holding companies receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A bank holding companys  

     93      

Table of Contents 

 ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.  

In addition, the Company must conduct semiannual company-run stress tests and is subject to an annual Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The Company received no objection to its 2015 capital plan (see Capital Management herein). Beginning with the 2016 capital planning and stress test cycle and in subsequent cycles, the cycle begins on January 1, and large bank holding companies must submit their capital plans and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2016. The Company expects that the Federal Reserve will provide its response to the Companys 2016 capital plan by June 30, 2016. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large bank holding company, including the Company, by June 30, 2016. The Company is required to disclose a summary of the results of its company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. In addition, the Company must submit the results of its mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve by October 5, 2016 and disclose a summary of the results between October 5, 2016 and November 4, 2016.  

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. The OCC has shifted the timing of the annual stress testing cycle that applies to the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries beginning with the 2016 cycle. MSBNA and MSPBNA must submit their 2016 annual company-run stress tests to the OCC by April 5, 2016 and publish the summary results between June 15, 2016 and July 15, 2016.  

Supplementary Leverage Ratio.  

The Company and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to publicly disclose their U.S. Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, which will become effective as a capital standard on January 1, 2018. By January 1, 2018, the Company must also maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage capital buffer of at least 2% in addition to the 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio (for a total of at least 5%), in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In addition, beginning in 2018, the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.  

Supplementary Leverage Exposure and Ratio on Transitional Basis under the U.S. Basel III Rules.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Computed as the average daily balance of consolidated total assets under U.S. GAAP during the calendar quarter.  

 (2)  Computed as the arithmetic mean of the month-end balances over the calendar quarter.  

 (3)  Reflects the addition of the potential future exposure for derivative contracts (including derivatives that are centrally cleared for clients), the gross-up of cash collateral netting where certain qualifying criteria are not met, and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by certain qualifying purchased credit protection.  

 (4)  Reflects the counterparty credit risk associated with repo-style transactions.  

 (5)  Reflects the credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposures, which is computed by applying the relevant credit conversion factors.  

 (6)  Reflects adjustments to Tier 1 capital, including disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.  

 (7)  At December 31, 2015, pro forma supplementary leverage ratios calculated using Tier 1 capital and pro forma supplementary leverage exposures computed under U.S. Basel III on a transitional basis for the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries were as follows: MSBNA: 7.3%; and MSPBNA: 10.3%.  

The Company estimates its pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 5.8% at December 31, 2015. This estimate utilizes a fully phased-in U.S. Basel III Tier 1 capital numerator and a fully phased-in  

      94     

Table of Contents 

 denominator of approximately $1,095.6 billion, which takes into consideration the Tier 1 capital deductions that would be applicable in 2018 after the phased-in period has ended. The pro forma supplementary leverage exposures and pro forma supplementary leverage ratios, both on transitional and fully phased-in bases, are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company considers to be useful measures for evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that have not yet become effective. The Companys estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from estimates based on these regulations. Further, these expectations should not be taken as projections of what the Companys supplementary leverage ratios, earnings, assets or exposures will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the Company, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.  

Required Capital.  

The Companys required capital (Required Capital) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. This framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with the Companys regulatory capital to ensure that the Company maintains an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from extreme stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The Company defines the difference between its regulatory capital and aggregate Required Capital as Parent capital. Average Common Equity Tier 1 capital, aggregate Required Capital and Parent capital for 2015 were approximately $58.2 billion, $39.0 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively. The Company generally holds Parent capital for prospective regulatory requirements, including for example, supplementary leverage ratio and U.S. Basel III transitional deductions and adjustments expected to reduce its capital through 2018. The Company also holds Parent capital for organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.  

Common Equity Tier 1 capital and common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segments relative contribution to the Companys total Required Capital. Required Capital is assessed for each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The Required Capital framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. The Company will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

 (1)  Amounts are calculated on a monthly basis. Average Common Equity and average Common Equity Tier 1 capital are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company and investors consider to be useful measures to assess capital adequacy.  

Resolution and Recovery Planning.  

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes its strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure of the Company. The Companys preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in its 2015 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. On August 5, 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC notified the Company and 10 other large banking organizations that certain shortcomings in their 2013 resolution plans needed to be addressed in their 2015 resolution plans. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC both were to determine that the Companys 2015 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution and the Company does not cure the plans deficiencies, the Company or any of its subsidiaries may be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth, activities, or operations, or, after a two-year period, the Company may be required to divest assets or operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  

The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated special purpose entities (SPEs) and lending-related financial instruments (e.g., guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.  

The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on the Companys securitization activities, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

For information on the Companys commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For further information on the Companys lending commitments, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk ManagementCredit RiskLending Activities in Item 7A.  

Contractual Obligations.  

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations include long-term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases and purchase obligations.  

Future Cash Payments Associated with Certain Obligations.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  For further information on long-term borrowings and other secured financings, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Amounts presented for Other secured financings are financings with original maturities greater than one year.  

 (2)  Amounts represent estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings based on applicable interest rates at December 31, 2015.  

 (3)  Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments related to time deposits primarily held at the Companys U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.  

 (4)  For further information on operating leases covering premises and equipment, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

 (5)  Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements, and certain transmission, transportation and storage contracts related to the commodities business. Purchase obligations at December 31, 2015 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  

 (6)  Amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable at this time (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information).

Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates.  

To the extent that an increased inflation outlook results in rising interest rates or has negative impacts on the valuation of financial instruments that exceed the impact on the value of the Companys liabilities, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. Rising inflation may also result in increases in the Companys non-interest expenses that may not be readily recoverable in higher prices of services offered. Other changes in the interest rate environment and related volatility as well as expectations about the level of future interest rates could also impact the Companys results of operations. For example, should interest rates remain stagnant or decrease to below zero for a prolonged period, this could negatively impact certain of the Companys businesses. See also Global Market and Economic Conditions herein.  

A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, therefore, can affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. For information about cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
