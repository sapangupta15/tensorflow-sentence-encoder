PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).

Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 94.0% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2013. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

· A 20.1% interest in 650 Madison Avenue, a 27-story, 594,000 square foot Class A office and retail tower located on Madison Avenue between 59th and 60th Street, for $260 million ($1.295 billion at 100%).  

· A 92.5% interest in 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square foot retail and office property located at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street in Manhattan, for $277.5 million ($300 million at 100%).

SEGMENT DATA 

We operate in the following business segments: New York, Washington, DC, Retail Properties, and Toys “R” Us (“Toys”). As a result of certain organizational changes and asset sales in 2012, the Merchandise Mart segment no longer meets the criteria to be a separate reportable segment; accordingly, effective January 1, 2013, the remaining assets have been reclassified to “Other.” We have also reclassified the prior period segment financial results to conform to the current year presentation. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is set forth in Note 26 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth quarter, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income. 

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Certain Activities 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2013, we have approximately 4,369 employees, of which 339 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,244 employees, including 2,564 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 516 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC and Retail Properties segments have 448 and 107 employees, respectively and the Merchandise Mart properties have 231 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.6% and 32.4%, respectively.

Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.
