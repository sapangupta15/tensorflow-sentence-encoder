Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data

For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 ("fiscal 2011"), we reported Net Earnings of $3.9 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.47 compared to Net Earnings of $3.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.01 for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2011 ("fiscal 2010"). 

Net Sales increased 3.5% to $70.4 billion for fiscal 2011 from $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010. Our comparable store sales increased 3.4% in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by a 2.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 3.0% in fiscal 2011.

In fiscal 2011, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:

Customer Service – Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. In fiscal 2011, we rolled out a new scheduling system for our associates and a new centralized return to vendor process. As a result, we now have approximately 53% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity. We have a customer-facing store payroll target of 60%, and we believe we will achieve that goal by 2013. Also in fiscal 2011, we began the process of rolling out in-store repair services for power equipment and power tools, and we believe this will be a significant improvement in convenience for our customers.

Product Authority – Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, including innovation, assortment and value. We are enhancing our special order system and when completed, this system will make the special order process both simpler and more accurate for our customers and associates. As part of this multi-phased project to improve our special order performance, we digitized our vendor catalogs in fiscal 2011. We also continued to form strategic alliances and relationships with selected suppliers to bring a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments in fiscal 2011.

Productivity and Efficiency – Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2011, we saw continued benefits from our supply chain investments, which improved our in-stock rate and asset efficiency. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to 4.1 times at the end of fiscal 2010. Additionally, as of the end of fiscal 2011, we handled approximately 70% of our U.S. Cost of Sales through centralized distribution compared to approximately 25% four years ago.

In terms of building shareholder value, we repurchased a total of 97 million shares for $3.5 billion during fiscal 2011. In addition, in November 2011 we announced a 16% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 29 cents per share.

Interconnected Retail – Our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success. Our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise, and we are making the investment to build these capabilities, including the roll out of Buy On-Line, Pick-up In Store ("BOPIS"), which we completed in fiscal 2011. In February 2012, we rolled out a significant upgrade of our website, which enhances the layout, visual appearance and responsiveness of the site.

We opened 11 new stores, including two relocations, and closed five stores in fiscal 2011, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2011 to 2,252. As of the end of fiscal 2011, a total of 278 of these stores, or 12.3%, were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 272 stores, or 12.1%, at the end of fiscal 2010.

We generated $6.7 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011. We used a portion of this cash flow to fund $2.5 billion of the total $3.5 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.6 billion of dividends and fund $1.2 billion in capital expenditures.

At the end of fiscal 2011, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio increased to 60.1% from 46.1% at the end of fiscal 2010 driven primarily by higher debt levels. Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 14.9% for fiscal 2011 compared to 12.8% for fiscal 2010.

Results of Operations

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 

Net Sales

Net Sales for fiscal 2011 increased 3.5% to $70.4 billion from $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 3.4% for fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2.9% for fiscal 2010.

The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives, economic growth and favorable weather conditions. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 12 of our 14 departments for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Building Materials, Paint, Hardware, Tools, Plumbing, Electrical and Kitchen product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Flooring, Bath, Lighting, Outdoor Garden and Indoor Garden product categories were positive for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Lumber and Millwork product categories were negative for fiscal 2011. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket and an 0.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions.

We believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. We estimate our share of the U.S. home improvement market is approximately 25% using the U.S. Census Bureau’s North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, 4441 classification for building material and supplies dealers.

Gross Profit

Gross Profit increased 4.1% to $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011 from $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 34.3% for fiscal 2010, an increase of 20 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the U.S., which was partially offset by higher shrink compared to last year.

Operating Expenses

Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased 1.1% to $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011 from $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 22.8% for fiscal 2011 compared to 23.3% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment partially offset by a $32 million impairment charge for a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business that was sold in fiscal 2011 and $26 million of expenses related to natural disasters. Additionally, we experienced an expense benefit of $44 million in fiscal 2010 related to our private label credit card that did not repeat in fiscal 2011.

Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 2.4% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets.

Operating Income

Operating Income increased 14.1% to $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011 from $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 9.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 8.6% for fiscal 2010.

Interest and Other, net

In fiscal 2011, we recognized $593 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $566 million for fiscal 2010. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010 reflects a $51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. (the "HD Supply Guarantee Extension"). Additionally, we experienced a $44 million benefit in fiscal 2010 that arose from favorable Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") guidance and a resulting reversal of an interest accrual.

18
Provision for Income Taxes

Our combined effective income tax rate decreased to 36.0% for fiscal 2011 from 36.7% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements.

Diluted Earnings per Share 

Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.47 for fiscal 2011 compared to $2.01 for fiscal 2010. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2010 were $2.03. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2011 reflect $0.13 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended January 29, 2012.

Non-GAAP Measures

To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect certain adjustments for fiscal 2010 and 2009. The results for fiscal 2010 included a $51 million pretax charge related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension as described more fully in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2009") reflected the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008. These strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming U.S. stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline, business rationalization charges related to the exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the "Exited Businesses") and charges related to the restructuring of support functions (collectively, the "Rationalization Charges"), as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These actions resulted in pretax Rationalization Charges of $146 million for fiscal 2009. The results for fiscal 2009 also included a pretax charge of $163 million to write-down our investment in HD Supply as described more fully in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. There were no adjustments for fiscal 2011, and the following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2010 and 2009(amounts in millions, except per share data):

 Non-GAAP Measures (continued):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Net Sales

Net Sales for fiscal 2010 increased 2.8% to $68.0 billion from $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 2.9% for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 6.6% for fiscal 2009.

The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 reflects a number of factors. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 12 of our 14 departments for fiscal 2010. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Tools, Electrical, Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden and Kitchen product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2010. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.4% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket.

Gross Profit

Gross Profit increased 4.0% to $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010 from $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 33.9% for fiscal 2009, an increase of 40 basis points. Our U.S. stores experienced gross profit margin expansion in fiscal 2010 as we realized benefits from better product assortment management through our portfolio approach and leveraging of our newly developed merchandising tools. Lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 also contributed to this expansion. Additionally, we realized gross profit margin expansion from our non-U.S. businesses, primarily Canada, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold.

Operating Expenses

SG&A decreased 0.3% to $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 23.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SG&A as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and lower payroll and other expenses.

Depreciation and Amortization decreased 5.3% to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2010 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.4% for fiscal 2010 compared to 2.6% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to a smaller depreciable fixed asset base compared to fiscal 2009, arising from fully depreciated assets.

20
Operating Income

Operating Income increased 21.6% to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 8.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 7.3% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges from the results of fiscal 2009, Operating Income increased 18.0% for fiscal 2010.

Interest and Other, net

In fiscal 2010, we recognized $566 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $821 million for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $51 million charge in fiscal 2010 related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension and a $163 million charge in fiscal 2009 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.0% for fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $44 million benefit arising from favorable IRS guidance resulting in the reversal of an interest accrual during fiscal 2010, a lower cost of outstanding indebtedness than fiscal 2009 and an interest benefit arising from certain state income tax settlements.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations increased to 36.7% for fiscal 2010 from 34.2% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 included benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure.

Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations

Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.01 for fiscal 2010 and $1.55 for fiscal 2009. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, and the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply from our fiscal 2009 results, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 were $2.03 compared to $1.66 for fiscal 2009, an increase of 22.3%. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 reflect $0.04 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock.

Discontinued Operations

On August 30, 2007, we closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2011, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $6.7 billion compared to $4.6 billion for fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in Net Earnings, changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2011 was $1.1 billion compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2010. This change was primarily due to increased Capital Expenditures and Payments for Business Acquired related to the purchase of an online home services platform, partially offset by Proceeds from Sale of Business related to the sale of a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business. In fiscal 2011, we spent $1.2 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 35% for core technology, 17% for maintenance, 17% for merchandising and operations, 11% for new stores and 20% for other initiatives. 

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2011 was $4.0 billion compared to $4.5 billion for fiscal 2010. In March 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% Senior Notes due April 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the "March 2011 issuance"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2011. The net proceeds of the March 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock under an Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") agreement, and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our 5.20% Senior Notes that matured March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.

In connection with the March 2011 issuance, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011. Also in fiscal 2011, we repurchased an additional 70 million shares of our common stock for $2.5 billion through the open market. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we 

21
have repurchased 931 million shares of our common stock for a total of $33.6 billion. As of January 29, 2012, $6.4 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization.

In May 2010, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the March 2011 issuance. Upon the March 2011 issuance, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap agreement for an immaterial amount.

We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 29, 2012, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in July 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of January 29, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.

We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

As of January 29, 2012, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan in connection with the sale of HD Supply. We are responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. As reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HD Supply for the period ended October 30, 2011, the outstanding balance of this term loan as of October 30, 2011 was $930 million. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010.

As of January 29, 2012, we had $2.0 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. 

In March 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016, with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At January 29, 2012, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $39 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement.

Also at January 29, 2012, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes due December 16, 2013 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 29, 2012, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $52 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements.

In March 2012, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement.

22
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 29, 2012 (amounts in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 —————

(1)Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $449 million. Includes $8.3 billion of interest payments.

(2)Includes $810 million of imputed interest.

(3)Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above.

(4)Excludes $524 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 29, 2012, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 82% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 18% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations.

As of January 29, 2012 we had, net of discounts, $10.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 29, 2012 was approximately $12.1 billion.

Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices

We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations.

23
Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.

Revenues

We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales.

Merchandise Inventories

Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 81% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2011 or 2010.

Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Self-Insurance

We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers’ compensation, medical, product liability and automobile claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Vendor Allowances

Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors.

24
Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SG&A.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.

The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SG&A the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income.

We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations.

As part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no material lease obligation costs in fiscal 2011 and 2010 and recorded $84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the Rationalization Charges. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows.

We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations.

We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income" ("ASU No. 2011-05"). ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. Under ASU No. 2011-05, an entity can elect to present items of net earnings and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. This guidance is effective for publicly traded companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, and retrospective application is required. As we report other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income, the adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 

In June 2009, the FASB issued "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" ("FASB ASC Subtopic 810-10"), which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. FASB ASC Subtopic 810-10 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept. FASB ASC Subtopic 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a company’s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
