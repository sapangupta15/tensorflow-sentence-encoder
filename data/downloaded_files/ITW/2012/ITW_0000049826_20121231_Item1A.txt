ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

The Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Weakness or downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.

During 2012, North American economic conditions were stronger than the European and Asia Pacific economic environments as European sales declined and growth in Asia slowed. The Company cannot give assurance that it will not experience adverse effects from broad economic trends in Europe, Asia or other geographies. Instability in global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

The global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.

The Company currently operates in 58 countries. In 2012, approximately 57% of the Company's revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the U.S. As the Company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales may represent an increasing portion of the Company's revenues. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include:

•fluctuation in currency exchange rates;

•limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;

•price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•transportation delays and interruptions;

•political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

•acts of terrorism;

•government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;

•the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;

•import and export controls;

•labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

•the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;

•difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;

8

•limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and

•potentially adverse tax consequences.

If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

If the Company is unable to successfully manage its enterprise initiatives, financial results could be adversely impacted. 

The Company has begun executing the following new long-term enterprise initiatives: business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and portfolio management. These initiatives include the scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses, better leveraging of purchasing power, and divesting non-core assets while targeting acquisitions with strong differentiation and growth potential. If the Company is unable to retain its key employees, successfully integrate acquisitions, maintain productivity or otherwise implement these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, financial results could be adversely impacted. 

Divestitures could negatively impact the Company's business, and retained liabilities from businesses that the Company sells could adversely affect the Company's financial results. 

As part of its portfolio management initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company expects its divestiture activity in the 2012 to 2014 period to increase over historical periods. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact the Company's business, including the potentially dilutive effect on earnings per share, distraction of management's attention from core businesses, potential disputes with buyers and potential impairment charges. In addition, the Company may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities related to the businesses sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. 

The Company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and return on invested capital.

Acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company's growth and profitability:

•Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the Company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company's anticipated timetable.

•Acquisitions could cause the Company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.

•Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.

•Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on the Company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.

•The Company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated. The realization of any of these liabilities may increase the Company's expenses or adversely affect its financial position.

•As a result of acquisitions, the Company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. If the Company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.

The Company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery or other laws.

The Company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls will always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery laws, competition, and export and import compliance. Any such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the Company or its subsidiaries, and could damage its reputation.

A significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's operating income.

Although the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Company's profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and 

9

incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.

Diminished credit availability could adversely impact the Company's ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain cost-effective financing.

The Company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its short-term liquidity needs. If conditions in the financial markets decline, there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to the Company or that the lenders participating in the Company's long-term credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of its credit agreements. A failure of one or more of the syndicate members in the Company's credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect the Company's liquidity. If the Company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, funds may not be available on cost-effective terms.

Raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.

The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and profit margins. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

If the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected.

The Company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company's competitive position.

Protecting the Company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. The Company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company's competitive position and results of operations.

Unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.

The Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.

The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.

Potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results.

The Company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains 

10

adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.
