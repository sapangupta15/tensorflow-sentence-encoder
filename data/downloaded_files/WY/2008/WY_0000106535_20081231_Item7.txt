MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION  

AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) OF  

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS MD&A  

Our MD&A includes the following major sections:  

     economic and market conditions affecting our operations;  

     financial performance summary;  

     results of our operations  consolidated and by segment;  

     liquidity and capital resources  where we discuss our cash flows;  

     off-balance sheet arrangements;  

     environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and  

     accounting matters  where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.  

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS  

A variety of market conditions in both the U.S. and global economies influenced demand and pricing for our products and affected our operating results in 2008. Those market conditions included the following:  

ECONOMIC GROWTH  

Although the U.S. economy grew only 1.3 percent on average in 2008, it declined dramatically in the second half of the year. Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the last two quarters of the year and job losses accelerated. Unemployment was 4.9 percent in the first quarter, but was near 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Global economic growth also slowed dramatically in 2008. This includes developing Asian markets, particularly China, which is an important market for our pulp products.  

INTEREST RATES  

Due to turmoil in the financial markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve took measures to lower short-term interest rates 4.3 percent over the course of 2008. However, that did not translate into lower mortgage rates since most investors were selling private long-term debt instruments and were buying treasury securities for safety.  

HOUSING MARKET  

U.S. single-family housing starts fell from 1.04 million units in 2007 to 622,000 units in 2008. This 40 percent decline masks the dramatic fall in the latter part of the year. By year- end, the annualized single-family start rate was near 400,000 units, a decline of 62 percent from 2007 totals. Home prices fell dramatically as well, ending the year 12.4 percent below fourth quarter 2007 levels.  

U.S. DOLLAR  

The U.S. dollar surged in value against the Canadian dollar and the euro in the second half of 2008 lowering the relative costs for competitors in Canada and Europe. The Canadian dollar is important for lumber and pulp prices, while the euro is important for pulp prices. Changes in the exchange rate of these currencies have a direct effect on prices of our products.  

HOW ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS  

Major effects that economic and market conditions had on our operations in 2008 included:  

     Sales of new and existing homes fell sharply in 2008, leading to further decline in single-family starts. Housing prices fell in all of our Real Estate markets, as home buyers now have to meet more restrictive lending standards to qualify for loans. Mortgage lending contracted in 2008 due to the financial market conditions and rising foreclosure rates.  

     Consumption of lumber and structural panels fell due to lower levels of homebuilding and repair and remodeling.  

     Wood products prices fell further in 2008 because of declining demand and the stronger U.S. dollar in the second half of 2008.  

     Log prices fell throughout the year, following declines in lumber prices.  

     Consumption of softwood market pulp fell by an estimated 2.5 percent.  

HOME SALES AND SINGLE-FAMILY STARTS DECREASED  

Tighter lending standards and high inventories of homes available for sale led to a sharp drop in new-home sales and single-family starts in 2008.  

LUMBER, STRUCTURAL PANEL AND ENGINEERED WOOD PRODUCT CONSUMPTION DECREASED  

IN 2008  

As single-family home starts fell further from the 2005 peak, demand for lumber, structural panels and engineered wood  

 30      

Table of Contents 

 products decreased in 2008. The decrease in demand for wood products has resulted in a decrease in product prices.  

DOMESTIC AND EXPORT LOG PRICES FELL  

Log prices typically follow product prices, but with a lag that varies by region. The lag for Southern log prices is longer than in the western U.S. markets. Domestic log prices in the western U.S. decreased 16 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. Lower housing starts in Japan and the drop in domestic log prices caused export log prices to decline in 2008.  

MARKET PULP PRICES ROSE SLIGHTLY IN 2008  

Market pulp prices rose 5 percent in 2008 despite a fourth-quarter plunge due to a sharp decline in demand and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. High fiber costs in Europe and Canada, a weak U.S. dollar, and tight operating conditions supported pulp prices through the first half of 2008.  

WHERE WE ARE HEADED  

At this time, market conditions for 2009 are extremely difficult to anticipate. We expect economic activity will continue to be weak through the first quarter of 2009 and are uncertain when recovery will occur. It is difficult to predict the ultimate result of the unprecedented level of intervention from the U.S. government or the actions by the Federal Reserve. It also remains an extremely uncertain period for the key factors affecting our businesses.

Table of Contents 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

In December 2008, the board of directors approved an amendment to our bylaws to adopt a December 31 fiscal year-end, effective for the fiscal year-end 2008. Prior to 2008, our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, the number of weeks in our fiscal year varied. For the last three years:  

     Fiscal year 2008 had 52 weeks and three days.  

     Fiscal year 2007 had 52 weeks.  

     Fiscal year 2006 had 53 weeks.  

In reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms:  

     Price realizations refer to net selling prices  this includes selling price plus freight minus normal sales deductions.  

     Contribution to earnings refers to:  

       earnings before interest and income taxes for the Weyerhaeuser business segments and  

       earnings before income taxes for the Real Estate business segment. Interest that previously was capitalized to Real Estate assets that are sold is included in cost of products sold and in contribution to earnings for the Real Estate segment.  

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

Net sales and revenue and operating income numbers reported in our consolidated results do not include the activity of our discontinued operations:  

     Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations (sold in August 2008);  

     Australian operations (sold in July 2008);  

      Trus Joist®Commercial division (held for sale as of December 2008);  

     Fine Paper operations (divested in March 2007);  

     Irish composite panel operations (sold in November 2006); and  

     North American composite panel operations (sold in July 2006).  

We report these activities and results as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. However, we include the results of these operations in the segment discussions that follow. See Note 3: Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our discontinued operations.  

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

Net Sales and Revenues, Operating Income (Loss), Earnings From Discontinued Operations and Net Earnings (Loss)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Asset impairments and related charges increased $1.8 billion.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $2.8 billion  26 percent.  

     Net earnings decreased $2 billion.  

Asset Impairments and Related Charges  

We continually monitor our assets for potential impairment, particularly in light of market conditions. The upheaval in financial markets during the fourth quarter of 2008 was accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets and a continued decline in demand and pricing for most of our wood products. In addition, declining demand in emerging Asian markets, primarily China, adversely affected our Cellulose Fibers operations. We recognized significant asset impairments in our Real Estate segment during the first three quarters of 2008 and the accelerated deterioration of market conditions triggered additional impairments in the fourth quarter. The continued deterioration of market conditions also led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments was impaired in fourth quarter 2008.  

 32      

Table of Contents 

Our asset impairments and related charges increased $1.8 billion  from approximately $320 million in 2007 to approximately $2.1 billion in 2008. The increase included:  

     $808 million in impairments of goodwill in our Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments and  

     $975 million in asset impairment and related charges in our Real Estate and Corporate and Other segments.  

Partially offsetting these increased charges is a $23 million decrease in impairments recorded in connection with closures, curtailments or sales of operations.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased significantly, primarily due to continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market. Declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as softwood lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and engineered lumber. Sales of products within our Wood Products segment, excluding those of discontinued operations, were $1.9 billion  34 percent  lower than 2007. These difficult market conditions also affected our Real Estate segment, where net sales and revenues decreased $ 951 million  40 percent  from 2007.  

Net Earnings  

Net earnings decreased $2 billion primarily due to the factors listed below.  

Reductions to pretax net earnings included:  

     $1.8 billion increase in pretax asset impairments and related charges discussed above;  

     $93 million increase in foreign exchange losses primarily due to an 18 percent decline in the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar average exchange rate in 2008;  

     $270 million decrease in pretax earnings due to lower price realizations for softwood lumber, engineered products and hardwood lumber in our Wood Products segment;  

     $334 million increase in losses on land sales;  

     $253 million resulting from lower sales prices and higher land, construction and development costs of single-family homes in our Real Estate segment; and  

     $118 million decrease in pretax earnings from lower price realizations and a change in mix of log sales in our Timberlands segment.  

Partially offsetting these reductions to pretax net earnings were:  

     $953 million increase in pretax gains on dispositions and investment restructuring.  

       Pretax gains of $1.6 billion recognized during 2008 included:  

       $1.2 billion from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

       $218 million from the sale of our Australian operations; and  

       $250 million gain from the restructuring of our joint venture in Uruguay.  

       Pretax gains of $690 million recognized in 2007 included:  

       $606 million from the Domtar Transaction and  

       $84 million from the disposition of property operating facilities and our New Zealand investments.  

     $173 million increase in sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment.  

     $52 million gain from changes in our postretirement plans for current salaried employees in the U.S. in 2008.  

In addition, income tax expense increased $211 million. Taxes related to gains from discontinued operation transactions increased approximately $1 billion primarily related to the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008. This change was largely offset by tax benefits related to our increased loss from continuing operations as compared with 2007 and a $57 million benefit we recognized related to timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (Tree Act) of 2008.  

COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006  

In 2007:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $2.6 billion  20 percent.  

     Net earnings increased $337 million.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market. Declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as softwood lumber, plywood, OSB and engineered lumber. Sales of these products within our Wood Products segment, excluding those of discontinued operations, were $2.2 billion  28 percent  lower than 2006. These difficult market conditions also affected our Real Estate segment, where net sales and revenues decreased $976 million  29 percent  from 2006.  

The decreases in our Wood Products and Real Estate segments were partially offset by improved market conditions for core products in our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling segment, which resulted in increased net sales and revenues of $256 million.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2008 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    33  

Table of Contents 

Net Earnings  

Net earnings increased $337 million primarily due to several significant, but largely offsetting, factors.  

Increases to pretax net earnings included:  

     $719 million reduction in pretax charges for the impairment of goodwill  $30 million recognized in our Wood Products segment during 2007 compared with $749 million recognized in our Fine Paper business during 2006;  

     $327 million increased contributions from improved price realizations for pulp in our Cellulose Fibers segment and from corrugated packaging in our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling segment; and  

     $594 million increase in pretax gains on dispositions.  

       Pretax gains of $690 million recognized during 2007 included:  

       $606 million from the Domtar Transaction and  

       $84 million from the disposition of property operating facilities and our New Zealand investments.  

       Pretax gains of $96 million recognized in 2006 included:  

       $51 million on the sale of our North American composite panel operations and  

       $45 million on the sale of our Irish composite panel operations.  

Reductions to pretax net earnings included:  

     $640 million decreased earnings on the sale of softwood lumber, structural panels and engineered lumber products in our Wood Products segment  $510 million from lower price realizations and $130 million from lower volume;  

     $376 million decreased gross margins on sales of single-family homes in our Real Estate segment;  

     $450 million decrease in pretax income related to legal matters  2007 included income of $12 million compared with income of $462 million in 2006, which included a $344 million pretax refund of countervailing and anti-dumping deposits; and  

     $197 million increased pretax charges for closures, restructuring and the impairment of operating assets and investments primarily in the Wood Products and Real Estate segments.  

In addition, income tax expense decreased $566 million. Pretax earnings from continuing operations were substantially lower in 2007 and the significant gain recognized on the U.S. portion of the Domtar Transaction was nontaxable.  

TIMBERLANDS  

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Timberlands.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers, intersegment sales, and contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Contribution to Earnings for Timberlands  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $5 million  1 percent.  

     Other sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $28 million  11 percent.  

 34      

Table of Contents 

     Intersegment sales decreased $312 million  23 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings declined $243 million  39 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  Unaffiliated Customers  

The $23 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:  

     $18 million decrease  3 percent  in log sales in the West primarily due to:  

       Average price realizations dropped 14 percent with the slowing domestic market and the declining U.S. housing market.  

       Partially offset by increased sales volume, both export and domestic, of 12 percent due to more available whitewood volume created by the December 2007 storm salvage logging.  

     $18 million decrease  47 percent  in log sales in Canada primarily due to:  

       Sales volume in Canada dropped 43 percent as a result of having fewer operations in Canada.  

       Average price realizations decreased 9 percent.  

     $49 million decrease  22 percent  in other sales and revenues from unaffiliated customers primarily due to lower timberlands exchange revenues.  

These decreases were partially offset by:  

     $41 million increase  73 percent  in log sales in the South as a result of increases in both volume and price.  

       We sold our containerboard mills to International Paper in August 2008. Log sales to those mills were previously reported as intersegment sales. Sales to the mills are now reported as sales to unaffiliated customers.  

       Fiber prices in the South increased due to lower available residual chip volumes as sawmills took market downtime.  

     $21 million increase  53 percent  in minerals, oil and gas revenue.  

Intersegment Sales  

The $312 million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from:  

     $125 million decrease due to a 35 percent decrease in the volume of logs sold to our Canadian mills as a result of fewer facilities and increased market downtime;  

     $58 million decrease due to a 7 percent decline in the volume of logs sold to our U.S. mills as a result of the slower housing market;  

     $58 million decrease due to a 20 percent decline in average log price realizations in the West;  

     $57 million decrease as sales to Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations became third-party sales after we sold our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business to International Paper in August 2008.  

Contribution to Earnings  

The $243 million decrease in contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $118 million decrease due to lower price realizations and a change in the mix of log sales to more whitewood and less Douglas fir;  

     $68 million decrease from fewer sales or exchanges of nonstrategic timberlands;  

     $67 million decrease due to higher operating costs driven by higher diesel prices for logging, trucking, handling and silviculture activities and by salvage logging costs resulting from the December 2007 West Coast windstorm; and  

     $27 million decrease as 2007 included a pretax gain on the sale of a Western export facility that did not recur in 2008.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $30 million increase in oil, gas and land management lease revenues; and  

     $10 million increase, as 2007 included a casualty loss from the December 2007 West Coast windstorm that did not recur in 2008.  

COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006  

In 2007:  

     Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $123 million  16 percent.  

     Sales of other products to unaffiliated customers increased $22 million  8 percent.  

     Intersegment sales decreased $340 million  20 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings declined $137 million  18 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  Unaffiliated Customers  

The $101 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:  

     $102 million decrease in log sales in the West primarily due to lower sales volumes and average price realizations as the domestic and export markets slowed due to the declining U.S. and Japanese housing markets,  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2008 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    35  

Table of Contents 

     $20 million decrease in log sales in Canada primarily due to having fewer operations following the Domtar Transaction and despite higher average price realizations and  

     decrease in the sales of Canadian chips because of fewer operations in Canada.  

These decreases were partially offset by increases in the sales of nonstrategic timberlands in the U.S.  

Intersegment Sales  

The $340 million decrease in intersegment sales was primarily due to the following:  

     fewer mills in operation following the Domtar Transaction and several Canadian mill closures and curtailments,  

     lower U.S. mill usage due to the slower housing market and  

     lower average log price realizations.  

Contribution to Earnings  

The $137 million decrease in contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $83 million decrease due to lower price realizations and a change in the mix of log sales;  

     $41 million decrease due to higher operating costs primarily for logging, trucking, handling and silviculture activities;  

     $25 million decrease because of lower fee harvest volumes from the long-term effects of Hurricane Katrina, other storm events and market downtime;  

     $18 million decrease in lower mineral and leasing income primarily due to a change in the method of accounting for oil and gas revenues and revenues associated with leasing our timberlands for recreational use; and  

     $10 million decrease for a charge for casualty losses resulting from a severe West Coast windstorm that occurred in December 2007.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $27 pretax gain on the 2007 sale of a log-export facility,  

     $17 million increase in earnings from the sale of nonstrategic timberlands and  

     $4 million increase in earnings from our international segment.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

Fourth quarter 2008 operating earnings reflected continued weak domestic markets and reduced fee harvest volumes. We do not expect markets to improve in the first quarter of 2009. We expect first quarter 2009 earnings to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008 as challenging market conditions persist.  

WOOD PRODUCTS  

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Wood Products business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Wood Products.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and contribution (charge) to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Contribution (Charge) to Earnings for Wood Products  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Impairments of long-lived assets increased $693 million.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $1.9 billion  34 percent.  

     Contribution (charge) to earnings decreased $813 million.  

Asset Impairments  

The accelerated deterioration of market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 adversely affected the results of our Wood Products operations and led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our iLevel reporting unit was impaired.  

 36      

Table of Contents 

The fair-value analysis takes into account:  

     the industrys reduced market multiples,  

     recent and expected operating performance and  

     an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends will likely continue.  

Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $733 million in the Wood Products segment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total goodwill impairments in 2008 for the segment were $743 million.  

During 2008, we also recognized $98 million of other asset-impairment charges in the Wood Products segment in connection with the expected closure, curtailment or sale of operations. This compares with total Wood Products asset-impairment charges of $119 million in 2007.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased $1.9 billion  34 percent  primarily due to the following:  

     Average price realizations for softwood lumber decreased $37 per thousand board feet (MBF)  11 percent  following the market trend.  

     Engineered I-joists average price realizations decreased $134 per thousand lineal feet  10 percent  and engineered solid section decreased $169 per hundred cubic feet  8 percent  in response to competitive market conditions.  

     Hardwood lumber average price realizations decreased $78 per MBF  8 percent.  

     Shipment volumes decreased across all product lines as follows:  

       Lumber decreased 1.8 billion board feet  28 percent.  

       OSB decreased 1 billion square feet 3/8  30 percent.  

       Shipment volumes of engineered I-joists decreased 111 million lineal feet  33 percent.  

       Engineered solid section decreased 8 million cubic feet  26 percent.  

     Sales of other products purchased for resale decreased 42 percent as a result of the sale of Canadian and selected U.S. distribution centers, a reduction in the product lines purchased for resale and overall decline in demand for building products.  

Contribution (Charge) to Earnings  

Contribution to earnings decreased $813 million primarily due to the following:  

     $743 million of charges in 2008 for the impairment of goodwill  compared with $30 million in 2007; and  

     $270 million decrease resulting from lower price realizations for softwood lumber, engineered products and hardwood lumber.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $78 million reduction in selling and administrative expense;  

     $171 million in charges for facility closures, other asset impairments, restructuring costs and litigation compared to $212 million in 2007; and  

     $13 million benefit recognized in connection with a reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims.  

In addition, contribution to earnings increased due to reductions in raw material, warehousing and delivery costs. However, these reductions were offset by increased manufacturing costs resulting from reduced operating postures and ongoing costs at curtailed facilities.  

COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006   

In 2007:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $2.2 billion  28 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings decreased $1.2 billion.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased $2.2 billion primarily due to the following:  

     lower average sales prices for softwood lumber and OSB  average price realizations declined 10 percent and 26 percent, respectively;  

     lower average sales prices for engineered I-joists and engineered solid section  average price realizations declined 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively;  

     decreased shipment volumes for softwood lumber, plywood, OSB, engineered products and other building products due primarily to the decline in market demand and the sale or closure of a number of distribution outlets in Canada and the U.S.; and  

     decreased shipment volumes for composite panel products primarily as a result of the sale of our North American composite panel operations in July 2006.  

Contribution (Charge) to Earnings  

Contribution to earnings decreased $1.2 billion primarily due to the decline in residential homebuilding and the resulting effects on product price and shipment volume. U.S. census statistics show that single-family housing starts declined 29 percent from 2006 to 2007. Decreases in Wood Products contribution to earnings included the following:  

     Contributions from product sales declined $680 million, including:  

       The contribution from softwood lumber and structural panels declined $460 million  $420 million from lower average price realizations and $40 million from reduced   

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2008 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    37  

Table of Contents 

 shipment volumes. Plywood prices increased from 2006, providing a partial offset to the lower prices realized for OSB.  

       The contribution from engineered I-joists and engineered solid section declined $180 million  about 50 percent from lower price realizations and 50 percent from reduced shipment volumes.  

       The contribution from sales of other building products declined approximately $40 million primarily as a result of reduced shipment volumes due to the decline in demand.  

     The net effect of legal settlements adversely affected the segment by $483 million. 2007 included $21 million of charges for legal settlements. 2006 included income of $462 million, including:  

       $344 million of income from refunds of countervailing and anti-dumping deposits relating to the softwood lumber dispute between the U.S. and Canada,  

       $95 million of income from a reversal of the reserve for alder antitrust litigation and  

       $23 million of income from a reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims.  

     Charges resulting from the closure or sale of various manufacturing facilities and distribution locations.  

     Gains on the sale of operations declined by $51 million as 2006 included the sale of the North American composite panel operations and 2007 had no comparable activity.  

These decreases were partially offset by lower raw material, manufacturing, and selling and general administrative costs, which increased the contribution to earnings by approximately $290 million.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

The segment recognized a fourth-quarter loss of $960 million, which included $761 million of charges for asset impairments, closures and restructuring activities. The operating results reflected significantly lower prices for lumber and oriented strand board and reduced sales volumes as a result of the continued decline in the housing market. We expect challenging housing market conditions to continue into the first quarter 2009 and expect first-quarter results for the segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding asset impairment, closure and restructuring charges.  

CELLULOSE FIBERS  

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Cellulose Fibers business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Cellulose Fibers.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Contribution to Earnings for Cellulose Fibers  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Asset impairments increased $94 million.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $67 million  4 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings decreased $82 million  36 percent.  

Asset Impairments  

The accelerated deterioration of market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 was accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in demand for pulp from developing Asian markets and a severe downturn in the global pulp market, which resulted in a significant decline in pulp prices. These developments led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Cellulose Fibers reporting unit was impaired.  

The fair-value analysis takes into account:  

     the industrys reduced market multiples,  

     recent and expected operating performance and  

     an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends will likely continue.  

Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $94 million in the Cellulose Fibers segment in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased 4 percent for the year primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume, which was partially offset by an increase in average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board.  

For the full year 2008 compared with 2007:  

     Average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging improved primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar and strong demand.  

       Pulp price realizations improved $82 per ton  11 percent.  

       Liquid packaging board price realizations improved $94 per ton  11 percent.  

     Sales volume of pulp declined approximately 366,000 tons  18 percent. The volume decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the Kamloops, British Columbia, pulp mill and other white paper mills in the Domtar Transaction in the first quarter of 2007.  

     Sales volume of liquid packaging increased approximately 16,000 tons  6 percent.  

Contribution to Earnings  

Contribution to earnings decreased $82 million primarily due to the following:  

     $94 million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter as discussed above;  

     $50 million reduction in earnings from lower pulp sales volumes;  

     $41 million increase in chemical costs primarily due to higher prices;  

     $38 million increase in freight costs primarily related to higher fuel prices and ocean freight;  

     $37 million increase in operating costs, including maintenance, depreciation and the effect of the strengthening of the Canadian exchange rate on Canadian operating costs; and  

     $33 million increase in fiber and energy costs primarily related to higher prices paid for chips and fuel.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $173 million from increased price realizations as a result of improved market conditions  $140 million from pulp and $33 million from liquid packaging board;  

     $20 million increase in earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture primarily due to higher newsprint market prices; and  

     $18 million in reduced expenses primarily from productivity improvements, cost reductions and increased cost recovery from slush pulp sales.  

COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006  

In 2007:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $124 million  6 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings increased $87 million  61 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased $124 million primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume, which was partially offset by an increase in average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board:  

     Average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging improved primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar and strong demand.  

       Pulp price realizations improved $82 per ton  13 percent.  

       Liquid packaging board price realizations improved $33 per ton  4 percent.  

     Sales volume of pulp declined approximately 551,000 tons  21 percent. The volume decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the Kamloops, British Columbia, mill and other white paper mills in the Domtar Transaction and the closures of the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, mill in March 2006 and the Cosmopolis, Washington, mill in September 2006.  

     Sales volume of liquid packaging increased approximately 11,000 tons  4 percent.  

Contribution to Earnings  

Contribution to earnings increased $87 million primarily due to the following:  

     $188 million from increased price realizations as a result of improved market conditions  $170 million from pulp and $18 million from liquid packaging board; and  

     $23 million reduction in expenses primarily from lower charges for chemicals and energy and increased cost recovery from slush pulp sales.  

Partially offsetting these increases in earnings were the following:  

     $53 million increase in raw material costs primarily related to higher prices paid for chips;  

     $37 million reduction in segment earnings from lower pulp sales volumes;  

     $22 million increase in operating costs, including maintenance, depreciation and the effect of the strengthening of the Canadian exchange rate on Canadian operating costs; and  

     $17 million decline in earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture primarily due to lower North American newsprint market prices.

Table of Contents 

OUR OUTLOOK  

The segment recognized a loss of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the $94 million goodwill impairment charge. Fourth-quarter results were also adversely affected by lower pulp price realizations, reduced shipment volumes and lower operating rates as we slowed production to match declining demand. Weaker pulp prices were partially offset by increased earnings in our Liquid Packaging and Newsprint businesses.  

The global pulp market suffered a sudden decline in the fourth quarter of 2008. We expect first-quarter 2009 earnings for this segment to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding the goodwill impairment charge. We anticipate lower pulp prices and increased costs related to annual maintenance. We will continue to manage production to meet declining demand.  

REAL ESTATE  

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Contribution (Charge) to Earnings for Real Estate  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Key trends from our single-family operations  including net sales and revenues, homes closed and average sales price  affected our Real Estate net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings. Here is a comparison of certain key items for the last three years:  

Key Data From Single-Family Operations  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The housing market continued to deteriorate during 2008, particularly in three of our key geographies  Southern California, Nevada and Arizona.  

For the Real Estate segment as a whole:  

     Our total buyer traffic decreased 38 percent, which resulted in a 39 percent decrease in sales (orders).  

     Substantial use of incentives and discounts in the industry has adversely affected our pricing strategy and margins.   

 40      

Table of Contents 

     Our contract cancellation rate was 32 percent for the year, but increased to 41 percent in the fourth quarter.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Impairments and preacquisition cost write-offs increased $906 million.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $951 million  40 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings decreased $1.56 billion.  

Impairments and Preacquisition Cost Write-Offs  

We continually monitor our assets for potential impairment, particularly in light of the current market conditions. Additionally, we control some land through deposits with land sellers that defer the payment of the full acquisition price until certain entitlements are obtained. We also control some land through structured options offered by land sellers.  

In 2008, we recorded $874 million in impairments and other related charges for real estate projects, joint ventures and intangible assets. This compares with $128 million in impairments and other related charges for real estate projects recorded in 2007. There was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the eroding market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tighter credit standards. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the already-depressed housing market was further affected by increased financial turmoil. Job losses, both actual and announced, and a loss of consumer confidence reduced the number of potential home buyers. Increasing foreclosures added inventory to the marketplace causing lower appraisal values and home sale prices.  

In light of these deteriorating market conditions and increased uncertainty regarding the timing of recovery, the company reviewed its homebuilding projects and land portfolio to determine whether the assets would continue to be held for development or sold. During fourth quarter 2008, management decided to sell some of its land portfolio, which required the company to write the land assets down to current fair value, resulting in impairments. Impairments also were recorded on projects and land held for development.  

In addition, we recorded $128 million in impairments and other related charges for our real estate investments in 2008 compared with $36 million of investment impairments and other related charges in 2007.  

In 2008, we also wrote off $74 million in costs associated with option deposits and other preacquisition costs related to land parcels that we decided not to acquire. In 2007, we wrote off $6 million of option deposits and preacquisition costs.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $951 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:  

     Single-family revenues decreased $785 million  38 percent. This included:  

       $204 million decrease  14 percent  in the average sales price of homes closed and  

       $581 million decrease  28 percent  in single-family home closings.  

     Land and lot sales decreased $114 million  54 percent.  

     Other revenue decreased $52 million as 2007 included revenue of $49 million from an apartment building sale with no comparable sale in 2008.  

Contribution (Charge) to Earnings  

The $1.56 billion decrease in contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     Impairments and preacquisition cost write-offs caused a decrease of $906 million.  

     Single-family activities caused a decrease of $253 million  55 percent  due to lower sales prices and higher land, construction and development costs. Single-family activity includes net sales less cost of goods sold.  

     Land sales resulted in a decrease of $334 million. In 2008 we recorded losses of $219 million in land sales compared with earnings of $115 million in 2007.  

     $42 million decrease resulted from earnings of $42 million for an apartment building sale in 2007 with no comparable sale in 2008.  

Offsetting the decrease was:  

     $33 million benefit from lower selling, general and administrative costs primarily due to lower sales commissions, marketing costs and incentive compensation.  

COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006  

In 2007:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $976 million  29 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings decreased $519 million  72 percent.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2008 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    41  

Table of Contents 

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $976 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:  

     Single-family revenues decreased $872 million  30 percent. This included:  

       $159 million decrease  7 percent  in the average sales price of single-family homes closed; and  

       $713 million decrease  24 percent  in single-family home closings.  

     Land and lot sales decreased $97 million 31 percent.  

Contribution to Earnings  

The $519 million decrease in contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     Single-family activities caused a decrease of $376 million  45 percent  due to lower sales prices and higher land, construction and development costs. Single-family activity includes net sales less cost of goods sold.  

     Impairments resulted in a decrease of $92 million.  

     Other income items from lower partnership and investment income, fewer investments, and charges taken against residential related investments caused a decrease of $76 million.  

Offsetting the decrease was:  

     $25 million from lower general and administrative costs primarily due to lower incentive compensation.  

Impairments and Preacquisition Cost Write-Offs  

In 2007, we recorded $128 million in impairments of real estate projects and intangible assets. This was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the challenging market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tighter credit standards. In 2006, we recorded $36 million in impairments of real estate projects.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

The segments contribution to earnings for fourth quarter 2008 was a loss of $630 million. This included asset and investment impairment charges, losses on land sales and restructuring costs totaling $614 million. Weyerhaeuser expects first-quarter home sale closings to be less than the fourth quarter due to seasonality and continuing weakness in the housing market. Excluding impairments, land and other asset sales and restructuring charges, the segments loss from homebuilding operations is expected to increase in the first quarter.  

FINE PAPER  

On March 7, 2007, our Fine Paper operations and related assets were divested in the Domtar Transaction. As a result, the year ended December 30, 2007, includes nine weeks of Fine Paper operations. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2007, we no longer have results of operations for the Fine Paper segment.  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Fine Paper business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Fine Paper.

 CONTAINERBOARD, PACKAGING AND RECYCLING  

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Contribution to Earnings for Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased by $2 billion.  

     Contribution to earnings decreased by $178 million.  

Net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings decreased as a result of the sale of these operations during the third quarter of 2008. Other changes affecting the year-to-date comparison are discussed below.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Prior to the third-quarter sale, year-to-date net sales and revenues increased primarily due to the following:  

     Packaging price realizations increased primarily due to the price increases implemented in September through December 2007.  

     Containerboard price realizations increased primarily due to the price increases implemented during the third and fourth quarters of 2007.  

     Containerboard shipments increased primarily due to a shift from low-margin box customers to the domestic containerboard market.  

     Recycled price realizations increased primarily due to increased demand from China.  

These increases in net sales and revenues were partially offset by a decrease in packaging shipments primarily due to a:  

     shift from low-margin box customers to the domestic containerboard market; and  

     weak U.S. economy, which adversely affected box demand.  

Contribution to Earnings  

Depreciation of the segments assets was suspended as of March 15, 2008, when the assets qualified as held for sale for accounting purposes. The year-to-date 2008 results include depreciation expense of $60 million.  

Items that negatively affected earnings included the following:  

     Raw material costs increased primarily from increases in old corrugated containers (OCC) due to the startup of new recycled containerboard machines in China, which caused pricing pressure in the U.S. Wood chip costs also increased due to weakness in housing starts.  

     Energy costs increased primarily due to higher natural gas and electricity costs.  

     Mill nonfiber and nonenergy costs increased primarily due to higher costs for chemicals and due to an unscheduled shutdown of a mill in June because of flooding.  

     Transportation costs increased primarily due to higher fuel prices.  

     Net charges for special items increased. 2008 included charges for facility closures, legal settlements and flood costs partially offset by fire insurance proceeds at a box plant and a gain on a property sale. 2007 included gains on two property sales partially offset by charges for facility closures and costs incurred as a result of the fire at a box plant.  

These decreases to earnings were partially offset by the following:  

     Packaging and containerboard price realizations increased.  

     OCC costs moderated beginning in the second quarter of 2008 after having increased all of last year and into the first part of this year as a result of strong demand from China.  

     Prices for wood chips were stable, but remained high.  

     Decreased supplies in both the West and South resulted from production curtailments at wood products manufacturing facilities due to weak housing markets.

Table of Contents 

 COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006  

In 2007:  

     Net sales and revenues increased by $256 million  5 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings increased by $119 million  45 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues increased $256 million primarily due to the following:  

     Containerboard price realizations increased $37 per ton  8 percent  as a result of a price increase for containerboard implemented in the first half of 2006 and another increase during the third quarter 2007.  

     Containerboard shipments increased 101,000 tons  12 percent  due to an increase in export demand and reduced internal consumption by our packaging plants.  

     Packaging price realizations increased $2.13 per thousand square feet  4 percent  due to increases in containerboard prices during the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2007 and from improvements in our product mix and the termination of low-margin business during 2007.  

     Price realizations for recycled materials increased $40 per ton  34 percent  as a result of higher prices for recycled materials due to increased demand from China.  

The increase in net sales and revenues was partially offset by the following:  

     Packaging shipments decreased 1.3 billion square feet  2 percent. First-quarter shipments were adversely affected by poor weather in California and the residual effect from the outbreak of E. coli during the fourth quarter of 2006. The combination of these issues had a substantial impact on produce markets.  

     Shipments of recycled materials declined 296,000 tons  10 percent. The supply of recycled materials available in the U.S. declined mainly due to increased demand in export markets, primarily China.  

Average weekly packaging shipments in the U.S. decreased 2.1 percent in 2007 in comparison with 2006, according to the Fibre Box Association.  

Contribution to Earnings  

Contribution to earnings increased $119 million primarily due to the following:  

     Higher price realizations resulted in increased contribution of $192 million  $157 million from corrugated packaging and $35 million from containerboard sales.  

     The net effect of closures, restructuring activities and asset sales was an increase in earnings of $51 million in 2007 compared with 2006. 2007 included a $29 million gain from the sale of a previously closed packaging facility in Cerritos, California, and charges of $13 million related to a fire and subsequent closure of the packaging facility in Closter, New Jersey, and other from post-closure activities. During 2006, the segment recognized charges of $35 million related to restructuring and facility closures.  

     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $41 million, mostly due to lower variable compensation expense and position eliminations stemming from facility closures and restructuring activities.  

     Nonfiber manufacturing costs decreased by $46 million. This reflects reduced costs for containerboard mill chemicals, a decrease in mill and packaging plant maintenance costs, and lower packaging labor costs as a result of the closure of nine plants and the sale of two plants during 2006 and early 2007. Partially offsetting these cost reductions were higher costs for energy and price increases for corn starch and wax. The increases in starch and wax, used in the manufacture of corrugated packaging, were driven by higher demand for ethanol, a corn derivative in the U.S., and higher petroleum prices, respectively.  

Partially offsetting the earnings improvements above were:  

     Raw material costs increased $196 million. OCC increased $41 per ton as a result of strong demand from China, and the price paid for wood chips increased by $9 per ton as a result of continued production curtailments in wood-related manufacturing plants due to reduced housing starts.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Contribution (Charge) to Earnings for Corporate and Other  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

HOW WE DID IN 2008  

During 2008:  

     We closed the sale of our timberlands, manufacturing and distribution business in Australia and the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business. The gain and results of operations for the Australian businesses and the gain on the sale of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business are included in Corporate and Other.  

     We completed the restructuring of our investments in Uruguay.  

     We began the process of restructuring our corporate support functions to better match the requirements of a smaller company.  

     We began exploring strategic alternatives for our regional short-line railroads.  

     We reclassified Weyerhaeusers ongoing international operations outside of North America from the Corporate and Other segment to the Timberlands segment for all periods presented.  

     We started retaining most of our pension and postretirement costs (credits) in Corporate and Other.  

The segments performance is affected by foreign exchange rate volatility, changes in our stock price and the associated variable compensation expense, and strategic initiatives outside the operating segments. Results for the Corporate and Other segment also include the net gain on divestitures that affect multiple business segments and the disposition of entire business segments, such as the gain on the Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business that occurred in 2008.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $40 million  9 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings increased $1.1 billion.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our Australian operations in July 2008, partially offset by increased revenue earned in our transportation business during 2008.  

Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.1 billion increase in contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     Pretax gains on dispositions increased $777 million  $1.4 billion in 2008 compared with $616 million in 2007. The gains include:  

       $1.2 billion in 2008 from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

       $218 million in 2008 from the sale of our Australian operations;  

       $606 million in 2007 from the Domtar Transaction; and  

       $10 million in 2007 from the sale of our New Zealand investment.  

     The restructuring of our joint ventures in Uruguay in 2008 caused a non-cash gain of $250 million.  

     Changes in our postretirement plans for current salaried employees in the U.S. in 2008 caused a gain of $52 million.  

     Net pension and postretirement income resulted in an increase of $197 million largely due to the effect of the change to retain most recurring pension and postretirement credits (costs) in Corporate and Other.  

These increases were partially offset by the following:  

     Net foreign exchange losses increased $92 million  $43 million loss in 2008 compared with $49 million gain in 2007. Foreign exchange gains and losses result from changes in exchange rates, primarily changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar and the relative value of the Canadian dollar to the New Zealand dollar.  

     Charges for corporate restructuring activities increased $55 million.  

     Charges related to the write-off of capitalized interest on impaired Real Estate homebuilding assets during 2008 increased $69 million.  

     We had a $43 million pretax gain from a legal settlement in 2007 with no comparable gain in 2008.

COMPARING 2007 WITH 2006  

In 2007:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $45 million  9 percent.  

     Contribution to earnings increased $695 million.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of the Irish composite panel operations in November 2006.  

Contribution to Earnings  

The $695 million increase in contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     Pretax gains on dispositions increased $571 million  $616 million in 2007 compared with $45 million in 2006. The gains include:  

       $606 million in 2007 from the Domtar Transaction,  

       $10 million in 2007 from the sale of our New Zealand investment and  

       $45 million in 2006 from the sale of our Irish composite panel operations.  

     Net foreign exchange gains increased $24 million  $49 million in 2007 compared with $25 million in 2006. Foreign exchange gains and losses result from changes in exchange rates, primarily changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar and the relative value of the Canadian dollar to the New Zealand dollar.  

     A legal settlement in 2007 resulted in a gain of $43 million.  

     Asset impairment and other charges related to prior dispositions decreased by $34 million.  

     Donations of timberlands to the Weyerhaeuser Company Foundation decreased $27 million.  

Partially offsetting these improvements was a charge of $26 million related to changing our information technology service providers in 2007.  

INTEREST EXPENSE  

Including Real Estate and interest expense reported in discontinued operations, our interest expense incurred for the last three years was:  

     $550 million in 2008,  

     $604 million in 2007 and  

     $670 million in 2006.  

The decrease in our interest expense incurred is primarily due to reductions in our amount of outstanding debt of approximately:  

     $1.4 billion in 2008,  

     $846 million in 2007 and  

     $401 million in 2006.  

In connection with the repayments, we recognized the following pretax (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt:  

     $(32) million in 2008 and  

     $45 million in 2007.  

 INCOME TAXES  

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years were:  

     $(888) million in 2008,  

     $(181) million in 2007 and  

     $358 million in 2006.  

 TAX BENEFITS, CHARGES AND CREDITS  

During 2008, we recorded the following tax benefit:  

     Timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (TREE Act) of 2008 enacted May 22, 2008, resulted in a tax benefit of $57 million. The provision is effective for one year and reduces the capital gains tax rate on qualified timber sales from 35 percent to 15 percent.  

During 2007, we recorded these one-time tax benefits and charges:  

     $22 million deferred tax benefit related to a reduction in the Canadian federal income tax rate and  

     $9 million charge to deferred taxes related to the Flat Rate Business Tax Reform in Mexico.  

During 2006, we recorded these one-time tax benefits:  

     $12 million related to a change in Texas state income tax law,  

     $18 million related to reduction in the Canadian federal income tax rate and  

     $18 million related to a deferred tax adjustment associated with the Medicare Part D subsidy.  

In addition, income tax expense (benefit) recorded in connection with divestitures are included in discontinued operations and include the following:  

     tax expense on dispositions of $887 million related to the gain on sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and $58 million related to the gain on sale of our Australian operations in 2008;  

     a tax benefit of $89 million from the sale of our Fine Paper business and related assets resulting from a rollout of temporary differences on the assets sold in Canada in 2007; and  

     tax expense on dispositions of $18 million related to the gain on the sale of our North American composite panel operations and $4 million related to the gain on the sale of our Irish composite panel operations in 2006.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:  

     protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and  

     have access at all times to all major financial markets.  

Our policy governing capital has two important elements:  

     viewing the capital structure of Weyerhaeuser separately from that of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO) because of the very different nature of their assets and business activity and  

     minimizing liquidity risk by managing a combination of maturing short-term and long-term debt.  

The amount of debt and equity at Weyerhaeuser and WRECO will reflect the following:  

     basic earnings capacity and  

     liquidity characteristics of their respective assets.  

WHERE WE GET CASH  

We generate cash from:  

     sales of our products;  

     short-term and long-term borrowings;  

     issuance of our stock  primarily upon exercise of employee stock options; and  

     sale of nonstrategic assets.  

CASH FROM OPERATIONS  

Consolidated net cash (used in) provided by our operations was:  

     $(1.3) billion in 2008,  

     $643 million in 2007 and  

     $1.6 billion in 2006.  

Comparing 2008 With 2007  

Net cash from operations decreased $1.9 billion in 2008 as compared with 2007 resulted from:  

     Consolidated cash paid for income taxes increased by $981 million primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008.  

     Cash we received from customers in our forest products operations decreased $987 million, which excludes Real Estate, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others. This decrease was primarily due to:  

       Cash from operations declined as a result of significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

       2007 cash from operations includes nine weeks of activity related to the operations that were divested in the Domtar Transaction. There were no cash flows from these operations in 2008.  

       2008 cash from operations includes 31 weeks of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling and approximately 30 weeks of Australian operations prior to their sales. 2007 includes 52 weeks of cash flows from these operations.  

     Cash we received from customers in our Real Estate segment, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $119 million primarily due to fewer closings of single-family home sales and the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

Comparing 2007 With 2006   

The $1 billion decrease in net cash from operations in 2007 as compared with 2006 resulted from:  

     $1.9 billion decrease in cash we received from customers in our forest products operations, which excludes Real Estate, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others. This decline was primarily due to:  

       significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market and  

       combined effects of the Domtar Transaction in March 2007 as well as the sale of our Irish composite panel operations in November 2006 and the North American composite panel operations in July 2006.  

This was partially offset by increased price realizations for pulp and containerboard, packaging and recycling products.  

     Cash we received from customers in our Real Estate segment, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $237 million primarily due to fewer closings of single-family home sales.  

     Cash paid for income taxes decreased $544 million, primarily due to the U.S. portion of the gain on divestiture of our Fine Paper and related assets were a nontaxable event.  

FINANCING  

Cash generated from financing activities includes:  

     issuances of long-term debt,  

     borrowings under revolving lines of credit and  

     proceeds from stock offerings and option exercises.  

This section also includes information about our debt-to-total-capital ratio.

Table of Contents 

ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  

Our issued debt and net borrowings (pay-downs) under our available credit facilities were:  

     $(452) million in 2008,  

     $664 million in 2007 and  

     $36 million in 2006.  

In the first half of 2008, we had net borrowings on our credit facilities. With a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business, we paid down debt in the second half of 2008, ending the year with net pay-down on short-term borrowings.  

STOCK OFFERINGS AND OPTION EXERCISES  

Our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were:  

     $4 million in 2008,  

     $321 million in 2007 and  

     $202 million in 2006.  

We did not recognize any excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options during 2008. We recognized $51 million in 2007 due to the high volume of stock options exercised when the price of our common stock reached record highs during the first quarter of that year.  

DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO  

Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was:  

     49.3 percent in 2008,  

     39.9 percent in 2007 and  

     39.4 percent in 2006.  

Weyerhaeusers investment in our Real Estate business segment was:  

     $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2008;  

     $2.1 billion as of December 30, 2007; and  

     $2 billion as of December 31, 2006.  

If we had used our cash and cash-equivalent balances of $2.4 billion, $114 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2008, December 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively, to reduce our outstanding debt, the consolidated debt-to-total-capital ratio would have been:  

     36.7 percent in 2008,  

     39.5 percent in 2007 and  

     38.7 percent in 2006.  

Excluding Weyerhaeusers investment in Real Estate  and the Real Estate amounts listed in the table below  our debt-to-total-capital ratio was:  

     51 percent in 2008,  

     42 percent in 2007 and  

     41.6 percent in 2006.

Table of Contents 

     $304 million in 2006 including:  

       $273 million from the sale of the North American and Irish composite panel operations; and  

       $31 million from the sale of property, equipment and other assets.  

Discontinued operations and assets held for sale are discussed in Note 3: Discontinued Operation and Assets Held for Sale.  

In 2008, $2.1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business were used to pay down outstanding debt in the second half of the year. A portion of the proceeds was invested in money market funds that are classified as either cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

HOW WE USE CASH  

In addition to paying for ongoing operating costs, we use cash to:  

     invest in our business,  

     repay long-term debt and credit facilities,  

     pay dividends and repurchase our stock and  

     meet our contractual obligations and commercial commitments.  

INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS  

We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2009  excluding acquisitions and our Real Estate business segment  will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. However, that amount could change due to:  

     future economic conditions,  

     weather and  

     timing of equipment purchases.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

LONG-TERM DEBT  

Our consolidated long-term debt was:  

     $6 billion as of December 30, 2008;  

     $7.3 billion as of December 30, 2007; and  

     $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2006.  

During 2008, we reduced overall debt  including that for our Real Estate segment  by approximately $1.3 billion.  

During 2008 and 2007, we retired $500 million and $962 million, respectively, of our long-term debt prior to its scheduled maturity. The (gains) and losses incurred were:  

     $(32) million in 2008 and  

     $45 million in 2007.  

See Note 14: Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES   

As of December 31, 2008, Weyerhaeuser Company and WRECO have two multiyear revolving credit facility agreements:  

       $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in March 2010 and  

       $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility that expires in December 2011.  

WRECO can borrow up to $400 million under each of these facilities. Neither of the entities is a guarantor of the borrowing of the other under either of these credit facilities.  

As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and the entire amounts were available for incremental borrowings.  

See Note 12: Short-term Borrowings and Lines of Credit in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

PAYING DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASING STOCK  

Over the last three years, we paid dividends of:  

     $507 million in 2008,  

     $531 million in 2007 and  

     $538 million in 2006.  

Changes in the amount of dividends we paid were primarily due to the decrease in number of shares outstanding during 2008 and 2007.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2008 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    49  

Table of Contents 

During 2007, we completed the stock-repurchase program that was announced in October 2005, which authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Since the authorization we repurchased:  

     7 million shares in 2007  net cost of $473 million;  

     10.8 million shares in 2006  net cost of $672 million; and  

     0.2 million shares in 2005  net cost of $11 million.  

During 2007, we also redeemed 25 million shares in connection with the Domtar Transaction.  

In December of 2008, the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $250 million of the companys outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2008, no shares had been repurchased under this authorization.  

In 2008, we paid a dividend, but we had negative cash from operations. This resulted in a negative dividend-payout ratio.  

Dividend payout ratios for the previous two years are:  

     83 percent in 2007 and  

     33 percent in 2006.  

In December of 2008, the board of directors declared a dividend of 25 cents per share, payable on March 2, 2009, reducing the quarterly dividend from the previous level of 60 cents per share.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.  

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:  

     historical experience and  

     assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.  

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.  

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:  

     pension and postretirement benefit plans;  

     potential impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill;  

     legal, environmental and product liability reserves; and  

     depletion accounting.  

Details about our other significant accounting policies  what we use and how we estimate  are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:  

     discount rate,  

     expected long-term rate of return,  

     anticipated trends in health care costs,  

     assumed increases in salaries and  

     mortality rates.  

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:  

     actual pension fund performance,  

     plan changes and  

     changes in plan participation or coverage.  

This section provides more information about our:  

     expected long-term rate of return,  

     discount rate and  

     cash contributions.  

Expected Long-Term Rate of Returns  

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plan. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. After considering all available information at the end of 2008, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets of 9.5 percent. Factors we considered include:  

     the 15.3 percent net compounded annual return achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy over the past 24 years and  

     current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.  

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:  

     $24 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and  

     $3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.  

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2008 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    51  

Table of Contents 

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long- term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total shareholders interest.  

Discount Rate  

Our discount rate as of December 31, 2008, is:  

     6.3 percent for our U.S. plans  compared with 6.5 percent at December 30, 2007; and  

     7.3 percent for our Canadian plans  compared with 5.5 percent at December 30, 2007.  

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.  

Our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:  

     $14 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and  

     $2 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.  

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2009 will be based on the 6.3 percent assumed discount rate for U.S. plans and the 7.3 percent assumed discount rate for the Canadian plans.  

Contributions Made and Benefits Paid  

During 2008:  

     We were not required to and did not make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plans.  

     We contributed approximately $23 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.  

     We contributed approximately $5 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans in accordance with minimum funding rules in accordance with the respective provincial regulations.  

     We contributed approximately $62 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.  

During 2009:  

     We expect to contribute approximately $19 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.  

     We expect to contribute approximately $7 million to our Canadian pension plans (registered and nonregistered).  

     We expect to contribute approximately $64 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.  

In addition, we expect to be required to contribute to at least one of our U.S. qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year. The required contribution is estimated to be between $50 million and $100 million and must be funded by September 15, 2010. The final amount will depend on the remeasurement of the plans liabilities at January 1, 2009, and the final value of the trust assets as of that date, which will be available later in 2009.  

Receivable From Pension Trust  

During 2008, there was a high volume of lump-sum distributions from our U.S. qualified pension plans. Retirement-eligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump-sum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans provisions. In addition, recent market events have adversely affected liquidity. For instance, many of the funds in which plan assets are invested have changed their redemption terms, delaying some of the pension trusts expected cash receipts. To avoid liquidating assets at depressed prices and, as permitted by law, we elected to provide approximately $200 million of short-term liquidity to the U.S. pension trust through short-term loans. These short-term loans were made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Repayment by the pension trust is planned in 2009.  

LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL  

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets  including goodwill  in our books. In addition, we review the amount of goodwill we carry on our books in the fourth quarter of every year.  

An impairment occurs when the fair market value of our goodwill drops below our carrying value or when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets.  

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:  

     future cash flows,  

     residual values and  

     fair values of the assets.  

 52      

Table of Contents 

 Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:  

     probability of alternative outcomes,  

     product pricing,  

     raw material costs,  

     product sales and  

     discount rate.  

Goodwill Update   

The collapse of financial markets in the fourth quarter of 2008, accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets, declining demand and lower prices for pulp products led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our iLevel and Cellulose Fibers reporting units was impaired.  

In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we considered the following valuation methods:  

     income approach based on discounted cash flows and  

     market-value approach, which considered valuation multiples of comparable companies.  

The fair-value analysis took into account:  

     the industrys reduced market multiples,  

     recent and expected operating performance and  

     an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends will likely continue.  

Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized:  

     $733 million for impairment of all of the goodwill in our Wood Products segment associated with the iLevel reporting unit and  

     $94 million for impairment of all of the goodwill associated with our Cellulose Fibers reporting unit.  

The total goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, was $43 million, composed of $3 million in our Wood Products segment and $40 million in our Timberlands segment.  

LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES  

We record contingent liabilities when:  

     it becomes probable that we will have to make financial payments and  

     the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

Legal Matters  

Determining our liabilities for legal matters requires projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility. We base our projections on:  

     historical experience and  

     recommendations of legal counsel.  

While we do our best in developing our projections, litigation is still inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts occur. Details about our legal exposures and proceedings are discussed in Note 16: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These exposures and proceedings are significant. Ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year.  

Environmental Matters  

Determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. We base our estimates on:  

     detailed evaluations of relevant environmental regulations;  

     physical and risk assessments of our affected sites;  

     assumptions of probable financial participation by other known potentially responsible parties; and  

     amounts that we will receive from insurance carriers  though the amounts are not recorded until we have a binding agreement.  

Product Liability Matters  

We record reserves for contingent product-liability matters when it becomes probable we will make financial payment. Determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claim rates and amounts. The hardboard siding reserve is our sole material product-liability reserve and is discussed in detail under Note 16: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

DEPLETION  

We record depletion  the costs attributed to timber harvested  as trees are harvested.  

To calculate our depletion rate, which is updated annually, we:  

     take the total cost of the timber, minus previously recorded depletion; and  

     divide by the total timber volume estimated to be harvested during the harvest cycle.  

Estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors:  

     changes in weather patterns,  

     effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications,  

     changes in environmental regulations and restrictions,  

     limits on harvesting certain timberlands,  

     changes in harvest plans,  

     scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology and  

     changes in harvest cycles.  

In addition, the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.

Depletion-rate calculations do not include estimates for:  

     future silviculture  or sustainable forest management  costs associated with existing stands;  

     future reforestation costs associated with a stands final harvest; and  

     future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
