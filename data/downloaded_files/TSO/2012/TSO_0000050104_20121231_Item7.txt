Our goals during 2012 were focused on these strategic priorities, and we accomplished the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

35
During 2013, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities described above by:

•focusing on opportunities to improve our base business and maximize refinery utilization;

•executing a slate of high-return capital growth projects focused on improving product yields and reducing feedstock and operating costs; 

•executing and completing our major turnaround plan;

•executing TLLP’s organic growth plan, maximizing capture rates and integrating the Chevron Northwest Products System; and

•successfully integrating BP’s Southern California Refining and Marketing business and initiating our capture of synergies, including feedstock optimization and product distribution, and operating improvements.

Tesoro Logistics LP

TLLP was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets to gather crude oil and distribute, transport and store crude oil and refined products. Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), a 100% consolidated subsidiary, serves as the general partner of TLLP. As of December 31, 2012, its assets consisted of a crude oil gathering system in the Williston Basin, eight refined products terminals in the midwestern and western United States, a crude oil and refined products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah, two marine terminals in California and a rail car unloading facility in Washington. Subsequent to TLLP’s equity issuance in January 2013, we owned an approximate 38% interest in TLLP, including an approximate 2% general partner interest. 

TLLP intends to continue to expand its business through organic growth, including constructing new assets and increasing the utilization of existing assets, and by acquiring assets from us and third parties. Although we have historically operated our logistics assets primarily to support our refining and marketing business, we intend to grow the logistics operations to maximize the integrated value of assets within the midstream and downstream value chain. We believe TLLP is well positioned to achieve its primary business objectives and execute business strategies based on its:

•long-term fee-based contracts;

•relationship with us;

•assets positioned in the high demand Williston Basin; and 

•financial flexibility. 

As the owner of the general partner of TLLP, the organic and third-party growth strategy discussed above will directly benefit us through TLLP’s quarterly distributions. As the distributions per unit increase, our proportion of the total distribution will grow at an accelerated rate. 

TLLP Acquisitions

Effective April 1, 2012, TLLP entered into a transaction to purchase, from Tesoro, our Martinez crude oil marine terminal assets (collectively, the “Martinez Marine Terminal”) and associated pipelines in exchange for $75 million, comprised of $67 million in cash financed with borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit agreement (“TLLP Revolving Credit Facility”) and the issuance of TLLP equity with a fair value of $8 million. The Martinez Marine Terminal consists of a single-berth dock, five associated crude oil storage tanks with a combined capacity of 425,000 barrels, two firewater tanks with 48,000 barrels of shell capacity and related pipelines that receive crude oil from third-party vessels for delivery to our Martinez refinery and a third-party terminal. Total throughput capacity for the Martinez Marine Terminal is estimated to be approximately 145 thousand barrels per day (“Mbpd”). 

Effective September 14, 2012, TLLP entered into a transaction to purchase, from Tesoro, our Long Beach marine terminal assets and related short-haul pipelines (collectively, the “Long Beach Assets”), in exchange for total consideration from TLLP of $210 million, comprised of $189 million in cash financed with borrowings under TLLP’s private placement debt offering and the issuance of TLLP equity with a fair value of $21 million. These assets, located near our Wilmington refinery, consist of a two-vessel berth dock leased from the city of Long Beach, six storage tanks with a combined capacity of 235,000 barrels and six related pipelines with 70 Mbpd throughput capacity connecting our Wilmington refinery to the marine terminal and other third-party facilities.

36
Effective November 15, 2012, TLLP entered into a transaction to purchase, from Tesoro, our Anacortes Rail Facility in exchange for consideration of $180 million, comprised of $162 million in cash and the issuance of TLLP equity with a fair value of $18 million. The Anacortes Rail Facility includes a four-track unloading platform, two receiving and departing tracks capable of handling a 100-car unit train and two additional short track spurs, as well as other related assets and properties associated with the facility. The facility, which was placed in service in September 2012, has a permitted capacity to deliver up to 50 Mbpd of Bakken crude oil to our Washington refinery.

On December 6, 2012, TLLP executed definitive agreements to purchase Chevron Pipe Line Company’s and Northwest Terminalling Company’s (collectively, “Chevron”) northwest products system (the “Northwest Products System”) for a total purchase price of $400 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2013. TLLP paid a deposit of $40 million upon execution of the purchase agreements, which may be retained by Chevron upon certain contract termination events.

The Northwest Products System consists of a 760-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulated common carrier products pipeline running from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington, and a separate five-mile jet fuel pipeline to the Salt Lake City International Airport. It also includes certain assets of the Northwest Terminalling Company consisting of the Boise and Pocatello, Idaho and Pasco, Washington refined products terminals, which are not subject to FERC regulation. The pipeline receives product from five refineries and one pipeline in the Salt Lake City area and is the primary transportation option from Salt Lake City to Pocatello, Boise, Pasco and Spokane. Delivery volumes on the system averaged approximately 84 Mbpd in 2011. The terminals have a total storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels and delivered approximately 51 Mbpd in 2011. 

Debt and Equity Issuances and Revolver Amendment

Effective September 14, 2012, TLLP completed a private notes offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (“TLLP 2020 Notes”). The proceeds of this offering were used to fund TLLP’s acquisition of the Long Beach Assets, to repay the outstanding balance on the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and to fund a portion of the acquisition of the Anacortes Rail Facility.

On October 5, 2012, TLLP closed an equity offering (“TLLP 2012 Equity Issuance”) of 4,255,000 common units at a public offering price of $41.80 per unit. Net proceeds to TLLP from the sale of the units were approximately $171 million. The proceeds of this offering were primarily used to fund TLLP’s acquisition of the Anacortes Rail Facility. At December 31, 2012, we held an approximate 47% interest in TLLP, including an approximate 2% general partner interest. 

On January 14, 2013, TLLP closed an equity offering (“TLLP 2013 Equity Issuance”) of 9,775,000 common units at a public offering price of $41.70 per unit. Net proceeds to TLLP from the sale of the units were approximately $392 million. In connection with the offering, TLGP purchased 199,490 general partner units at a price of $41.70 per unit to maintain its 2% general partner interest in TLLP. Subsequent to the TLLP 2013 Equity Issuance on January 14, 2013, we owned an approximate 38% interest in TLLP, including an approximate 2% general partner interest. 

Effective January 4, 2013, TLLP amended and restated the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, which increases total revolving loan availability under the facility from $300 million to $500 million and allows TLLP to request that the availability be increased up to an aggregate of $650 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. 

Completion of North Dakota Refinery Expansion

We completed a project to expand the crude oil throughput capacity at our North Dakota refinery from 58 to 68 Mbpd in 2012. The expansion allows the refinery to process additional crude oil from the nearby Williston Basin delivered via TLLP’s crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana (the “High Plains System”).

Labor Negotiations

During 2012, we completed the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements that are set to expire in 2015 and cover our full-time represented union employees. We believe that these agreements are fair, competitive and consistent with other national agreements accepted by the United Steelworkers union. 

37
Hawaii Operations

In January 2013, we announced that we intend to cease refining operations at our Hawaii refinery in April 2013, and begin the process of converting the refinery to an import, storage and distribution terminal. We plan to maintain the existing distribution system to support marketing operations and fulfill supply commitments while continuing to offer the terminal, distribution and retail assets for sale. 

Carson Acquisition 

On August 8, 2012, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with BP West Coast Products, LLC and certain other sellers to purchase BP’s integrated Southern California refining and marketing business. The assets to be acquired include the 266 Mbpd Carson refinery located adjacent to our Wilmington refinery, three marine terminals, four land storage terminals, over one hundred miles of pipelines and four product marketing terminals. In addition, the assets include the ARCO® brand and associated registered trademarks, as well as a master franchisee license for the ampm® convenience store brand and the supply rights to approximately 800 branded dealer-operated and branded wholesale stations in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, we will acquire a 51% ownership in the 400 megawatt gas fueled Watson cogeneration facility; and also a 350,000 metric ton per year anode coke calcining operation, both located near the Carson refinery. We expect to realize significant operational synergies through the integrated crude oil supply, enhanced optimization of intermediate feedstocks and product distribution costs, improvements in light product yield and reductions in manufacturing costs and stationary source air emissions. 

The purchase price is $1.175 billion, plus the value of inventories at the time of closing. The inventory value announced in August 2012 was estimated at $1.3 billion. The purchase and sale agreement provides for a $100 million reduction in the purchase price upon meeting certain conditions as defined in the agreement. This acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions and will require approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the California Attorney General, is expected to close before mid-2013. The purchase and sale agreement also required an advance payment of $90 million and provides for us to pay a break-up fee of up to $140 million in the event that we terminate the agreement (except for termination for specified reasons). In the event a break-up fee is required, the advance payment of $90 million will be applied to the amount due. Upon the closing of the Carson Acquisition, the sellers have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to retain certain obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of the pre-closing operations of the assets. We have agreed to assume certain obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with decrees, orders and settlements the sellers entered into with governmental and non-governmental entities prior to closing. We expect that upon closing the Carson Acquisition, we will record certain assumed environmental liabilities. While these liabilities will likely be significant, we do not believe that they will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

We intend to offer TLLP the integrated logistics system to be acquired in the Carson Acquisition in multiple transactions during the first twelve months following the closing of the Carson Acquisition, with a goal for the first transaction to coincide with the closing of the Carson Acquisition. The integrated logistics system includes three marine terminals, four land storage terminals, four product marketing terminals, and over one hundred miles of pipelines (including connected access to the Los Angeles International Airport).

Industry Overview

Our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is affected by changes in economic conditions and supply and demand balance. Product values and crude oil costs are set by the market and are outside of the control of independent refiners.

Average Mid-Continent Benchmark 

Product Differentials to WTI ($/bbl)

Average West Coast Benchmark 

Product Differentials to ANS ($/bbl)

 Significant turnaround activity and unplanned refinery outages by third parties on the U.S. West Coast impacted overall supply during 2012. Average Mid-Continent benchmark diesel and gasoline margins were up approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to 2011. Average U.S. West Coast benchmark diesel fuel margins and gasoline margins were up approximately 7% and 35%, respectively, in 2012, as compared to 2011. Planned maintenance activities and crude oil delivery disruptions in our California region limited our realization of these improved benchmark margins. 

Nationwide unemployment fell to its lowest level in over three years at the end of 2012. The nationwide unemployment rate decreased from 8.5% at the end of 2011 to 7.8% at the end of 2012. In California, a key market area for Tesoro, the state’s unemployment rate fell by 1.4%, from December 2011 to December 2012, to 9.8%. Lower unemployment and unplanned refinery outages contributed to the improved market conditions on the U.S. West Coast. Additionally, emerging markets, primarily in Latin America, have provided an export opportunity for diesel and other light products.

39
Average Crude Oil Prices ($/bbl)

Our Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest refineries have benefited from processing crude oils from inland U.S. and Canada, many of which are priced off West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil. This benefit is a result of a significant discount on the price of these crude oils compared to the crude oil processed at our California and Mid-Pacific refineries, many of which are priced off Brent crude oil (“Brent”). Historically, the price of WTI crude oil was comparable to Brent, but beginning in 2011 WTI has priced at a significant discount to Brent. This benefit could decline as various crude oil pipeline and logistics projects are completed, which will allow sweet crude oil from the inland U.S. to be transported to the U.S. Gulf Coast region. These projects may result in a narrowing of the price differential of WTI-priced crude oil relative to Brent-priced crude oil, which may decrease the margins on refined products for refiners that process WTI-priced crude oil.

The WTI discount to Brent remained high throughout 2012, averaging more than $17 per barrel during the year. We supplied our North Dakota refinery exclusively with Bakken crude oil in 2012. We supplied our Washington refinery with a significant amount of price advantaged Canadian Light Sweet crude oil during most of 2012. Upon completion of the Anacortes Rail Facility in the third quarter of 2012, we also began to supply Bakken crude oil to our Washington refinery and plan to increase the supply of Bakken crude oil to the refinery throughout 2013. During 2012, the average discount of Bakken crude oil to WTI increased to over $5 per barrel, compared to a premium of $3 per barrel during 2011. The average discount of Canadian Light Sweet crude oil to WTI increased to approximately $7 per barrel during 2012 compared to a premium of $2 per barrel during 2011. 

Our California refineries ran a significant amount of California heavy crude, including San Joaquin Valley Heavy (“SJVH”), which continued to be priced at a discount to Brent throughout 2012. During 2012 we supplied our Alaska refinery primarily with Alaska North Slope crude oil (“ANS”). The average discount of ANS to Brent was less than $1 per barrel during 2012.

40
Product Supply and Demand Factors

There are long-term factors, in addition to current market conditions, that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the U.S. including:

•world crude oil prices; 

•increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles; 

•increased volumes of renewable fuels, mandated by the Federal Clean Air Act; 

•various regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile sources by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act and California statute;

•potential enactment of federal climate change legislation; and

•possible promulgation of national regulations relative to gasoline composition and ozone standards under the Federal Clean Air Act.

41
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. Income generated by TLLP was not material to our consolidated results of operations.

Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze operating segment performance. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), our management uses additional metrics that are known as “non-GAAP” financial metrics in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (“EBITDA”). We define EBITDA as earnings (loss) before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest and financing costs, income taxes and interest income. 

We present EBITDA because we believe some investors and analysts use EBITDA to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and use cash for other purposes, including capital expenditures. EBITDA is also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net income or net cash from operating activities. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash from operating activities.

(a)Excludes foreign exchange loss of $1 million and $2 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and foreign exchange gain of $2 million in 2010 in order to reconcile EBITDA. Foreign exchange gains (losses) are included in net interest and financing costs in our statements of consolidated operations.

(b)For a definition of EBITDA, see discussion above.

Our net earnings in 2012 were $743 million ($5.25 per diluted share) compared with net earnings of $546 million ($3.81 per diluted share) in 2011. The increase in net earnings of $197 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, was primarily due to the following:

•an increase in gross refining margins of $559 million driven by a strong margin environment and feedstock advantages in 2012; 

•a $51 million impairment charge in 2011 related to a change in scope of a capital project at our Wilmington refinery; 

•a $43 million decrease in manufacturing costs primarily related to lower energy costs during 2012; and

•a $43 million increase in retail segment operating income during 2012 as a result of a 14% increase in fuel sales volumes, increased refining and marketing integration and improved market conditions during 2012.

The increase in net earnings during 2012 relative to 2011 was partially offset by the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•a $100 million increase in income tax expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of higher earnings during the year;

•a $62 million increase in stock and incentive-based compensation expense, primarily resulting from a significant increase in Tesoro’s stock price during 2012 as compared to 2011;

•$37 million of property and business interruption insurance recoveries related to the Washington refinery incident collected in 2011;

•expense of $28 million related to legal matters in 2012; and

•transaction costs of $13 million related to the Carson Acquisition, TLLP’s purchase of the Northwest Products System and the sales of various assets to TLLP during 2012.

43
Our net earnings in 2011 were $546 million ($3.81 per diluted share) compared with a net loss of $29 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in 2010. The increase in net earnings of $575 million, or $4.02 per diluted share, was primarily due to the following:

•significant increases in gross refining margins of $970 million, driven by feedstock advantages, lower manufacturing cost per barrel, and higher throughput primarily as a result of increased utilization of 87%, and the temporary shut-down of processing at the Washington refinery in 2010; and

•growth in refining and marketing integration from the increased number of retail stations and wholesale supply contracts.

The increase in net earnings during 2011 relative to 2010 was partially offset by the following:

•a $338 million increase in income tax expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of higher earnings during the year; 

•a $48 million gain recognized in 2010 from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses; 

•a $31 million higher loss in 2011 as compared to 2010, related to write-downs due to a change in scope of a capital project at our Wilmington refinery;

•the receipt of $67 million of business interruption and property insurance recoveries in 2010, compared to the receipt of $37 million of business interruption and property insurance recoveries in 2011, related to the April 2010 incident at our Washington refinery; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)Management uses various measures to evaluate performance and efficiency, and to compare profitability to other companies in the industry, including gross refining margin per barrel, manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense (“Manufacturing Costs”) per barrel and refined products sales margin per barrel. 

•Management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate gross refining margin per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate gross refining margin per barrel by dividing gross refining margin (revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput. 

•Management uses Manufacturing Costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refining operations. There are a variety of ways to calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput.

•Management uses refined product sales margin per barrel to evaluate the profitability of manufactured and purchased refined product sales. There are a variety of ways to calculate refined product sales margin per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate refined product sales margin per barrel by dividing refined product sales and refined product cost of sales by total refining throughput, and subtracting refined product cost of sales per barrel from refined product sales per barrel. 

Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales, and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Refining Data by Region

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(j)We experienced reduced throughput due to scheduled turnarounds at our Martinez, Alaska and Hawaii refineries in 2012, our Martinez refinery in 2011 and at our Hawaii, North Dakota, Martinez and Utah refineries in 2010. We also temporarily shut-down processing at the Washington refinery beginning in April 2010, and resumed operations at planned rates in November 2010. 

2012 Compared to 2011

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased by $373 million to $1.6 billion from 2011 to 2012. The increase is primarily due to increased gross refining margins driven by feedstock advantages from crude oil discounts relative to industry benchmarks during 2012, partially offset by $248 million in impairment charges and asset retirement obligations related to our Hawaii refinery.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased by $2.43 per barrel, or 17%, to $16.37 per barrel in 2012 as compared to 2011, reflecting strong industry margins and lower crude oil cost relative to industry benchmarks in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest markets. Decreased crude oil costs for our Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest refineries contributed to strong refining margins for these regions. Industry distillate and gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast increased 7% and 35%, respectively, while industry distillate and gasoline margins in the Mid-Continent increased 12% and 13%, respectively during 2012. The significantly higher gross refining margin per barrel and increased throughputs in these regions positively impacted gross refining margins by $558 million in 2012 as compared to 2011.

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 6 Mbpd, or 1%, to 585 Mbpd in 2012 as compared to 579 Mbpd in 2011 primarily due to the expansion of our North Dakota refinery, which was completed during 2012 and higher throughputs at our Washington refinery as a result of favorable market conditions. The increase was partially offset by scheduled turnarounds at our Alaska and Hawaii refineries during 2012.

47
Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $2.4 billion, or 8% to $31.4 billion in 2012 as compared to $29.1 billion in 2011, primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price increased $2.11 per barrel, or 2%, to $123.20 per barrel in 2012 as compared to $121.09 per barrel in 2011. Total refined product sales increased by 33 Mbpd, or 5%, to 693 Mbpd in 2012 as compared to 660 Mbpd in 2011. Refined product sales volumes were impacted by increased demand for diesel fuel and gasoline and additional branded marketing supply agreements.

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased by $0.80 per barrel, or 1%, to $110.76 per barrel in 2012 as compared to $109.96 per barrel in 2011, reflecting slightly higher crude oil prices as compared to 2011. Manufacturing and other operating expenses decreased by $24 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion in 2012 as a result of lower energy costs, primarily natural gas. The reduction was partially offset by $5 million in property insurance recoveries recorded during 2011 related to the 2010 Washington refinery incident with no comparable insurance recoveries in 2012.

Loss on Asset Disposals and Impairments. Loss on asset disposals increased to $262 million in 2012, as compared to $60 million in 2011. During 2012, we recognized impairment charges of $228 million and asset retirement obligations of $20 million related to our Hawaii refinery. We expect to cease operations at our Hawaii refinery in April 2013, and begin the process of converting the refinery to an import, storage and distribution terminal. In 2011, we recorded a $51 million loss as a result of a change in scope of a capital project at our Wilmington refinery.

2011 Compared to 2010

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased by $924 million, to $1.2 billion from 2010 to 2011. The increase primarily reflects improved total gross refining margins of $970 million during the year. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase of $17 million in manufacturing and other operating expenses.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased by $2.68 per barrel, or 24%, to $13.94 per barrel in 2011 as compared to $11.26 per barrel in 2010, reflecting high industry distillate margins throughout the year. Decreased relative crude oil costs for our Mid-Continent refineries contributed to strong refining margins for that region. Industry distillate margins on the U.S. West Coast increased approximately 39% during 2011, while industry gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast declined approximately 18% throughout 2011. The significantly higher gross refining margin per barrel positively impacted consolidated gross refining margins by $970 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. 

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 99 Mbpd, or 21%, to 579 Mbpd during 2011 as compared to 480 Mbpd in 2010 primarily due to our Washington refinery being fully operational for the full year in 2011, as compared to 2010 when we temporarily shut-down processing at our Washington refinery subsequent to the April 2010 incident. Additionally, our throughputs were higher in 2011 because of favorable market conditions, improved reliability and turnarounds at our Martinez, Hawaii, Utah and North Dakota refineries in 2010.

Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $10 billion, or 53%, to $29 billion in 2011 as compared to $19 billion in 2010, primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price increased $30.06 per barrel, or 33%, to $121.09 per barrel in 2011 as compared to $91.03 in 2010, as higher crude oil prices put upward pressure on product prices. Total refined product sales increased by 88 Mbpd, or 15%, to 660 Mbpd in 2011 as compared to 572 Mbpd in 2010. Refined product sales volumes were impacted by increased demand for diesel fuel and gasoline and additional branded marketing supply agreements.

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average cost of sales increased by $27.30 per barrel, or 33%, to $109.96 per barrel during 2011 as compared to $82.66 during 2010, reflecting higher crude oil prices. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $17 million, or 1%, to $1.3 billion in 2011 as a result of higher energy costs due to significant increases in throughput volumes. We recorded $67 million of business interruption insurance and property insurance recoveries during 2010, as compared to only $37 million in 2011, related to the 2010 Washington refinery incident which reduced cost of sales and operating expenses. Additionally, the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits resulted in a $32 million gain in 2010. 

Loss on Asset Disposals and Impairments. Loss on asset disposals increased by $12 million, or 25%, primarily due to a change in scope of a capital project at our Wilmington refinery. The change resulted in a $51 million loss related to this project in 2011, as compared to a $20 million loss in 2010. The increase was partially offset by a goodwill write-off of $10 million recorded in 2010 related to out Hawaii refinery. The book value of our Hawaii refinery increased as a result of the 2010 turnaround while the estimated fair value decreased based on estimated future cash flows.

Retail Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel margin per gallon; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate fuel margin per gallon by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes. Investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered an alternative to revenues, segment operating income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Fuel margin and fuel margin per gallon include the effect of intersegment purchases from the refining segment at prices which approximate market.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2012 Compared to 2011

Operating Income. Operating income for our retail segment increased $43 million, or 48%, to $132 million in 2012 as compared to $89 million in 2011. During 2012, higher retail fuel margins positively impacted operating income. Total gross margin increased $117 million, or 33% to $469 million in 2012 compared to $352 million in 2011. Retail fuel margin per gallon increased 22% to $0.22 per gallon in 2012 causing fuel gross margins to increase $111 million from 2011. Additionally, fuel sales volumes increased by 214 million gallons, or 14%, in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflecting additional volumes as a result of higher average station count from the acquisition and transition of additional retail stations in 2012. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margin also increased by $6 million to $84 million during 2012 compared to $78 million in 2011 due to the higher average station count. 

49
Fuel sales revenues increased $1.0 billion, or 19%, to $6.1 billion in 2012 as compared to $5.1 billion in 2011, reflecting significantly higher average sales prices and increased fuel sales volumes as a result of higher average station count in 2012. Operating expenses increased $71 million, or 35%, to $273 million during 2012 as compared to $202 million in 2011, primarily due to additional expenses incurred to operate the stations acquired and transitioned in 2012. Our other expenses remained relatively consistent compared to 2011.

2011 Compared to 2010

Operating Income. Our retail segment operating income decreased $8 million, or 8% to $89 million in 2011 as compared to $97 million in 2010. Total gross margin decreased $6 million, or 2%, to $352 million in 2011 compared to $358 million in 2010. Retail fuel margin per gallon decreased 14% to $0.18 per gallon in 2011 leading fuel gross margins to decrease $5 million from 2010. The decrease was partially offset by a 190 million gallon, or 14%, increase in fuel sales volumes in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily from the addition of branded marketing supply contracts in the Mid-Continent region, which were added in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margin remained stable at $78 million during 2011 compared to $79 million in 2010.

Fuel sale revenues increased $1.5 billion, or 42%, to $5.1 billion in 2011 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2010, reflecting significantly higher average sales prices and increased fuel sales volumes. Our other expenses remained relatively consistent compared to 2010.

Consolidated Results of Operations

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73 million, or 31%, to $310 million in 2012 from $237 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $56 million increase in stock and incentive-based compensation expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was driven by higher expense recorded for our stock appreciation rights and performance share awards, which are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, and increased by $34 million and $11 million, respectively. Additionally, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $13 million related to the Carson Acquisition, TLLP’s purchase of the Northwest Products System and the sales of various assets to TLLP during 2012. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5 million or 2% to $237 million in 2011 from $242 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense recorded for our restricted common stock and executive phantom stock options, which decreased by $5 million and $6 million, respectively. All of the remaining outstanding executive phantom stock options, which are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, were exercised during 2011. Additionally, restricted common stock expense, which is recognized over the vesting period, decreased due to a significant reduction in the number of awards outstanding during the period as a result of vestings and forfeitures. 

Interest and Financing Costs, Net. Net interest and financing costs decreased $13 million, or 7%, to $166 million in 2012 from $179 million in 2011. We redeemed $328 million of our Junior Subordinated Notes and senior notes in 2011 and $299 million of our senior notes in 2012, resulting in a decrease in interest expense in 2012. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by an increase of $6 million for charges associated with the early redemption of debt during 2012 as compared to 2011. 

Net interest and financing costs increased $24 million, or 15% to $179 million in 2011 from $155 million in 2010. The increase reflects a $13 million charge to expense the remaining unamortized discount on the Junior Subordinated Notes, which were redeemed during 2011, a $9 million charge related to premiums paid associated with the redemption of a portion of our 6.250% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes, and interest on borrowings outstanding under the Tesoro Panama Company S.A. (“TPSA”) Revolving Credit Facility, which was entered into in October 2010. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from a reduction in outstanding long-term debt.

Other Income (Expense), Net. We incurred other expense, net of $26 million in 2012, which includes accruals related to certain legal matters partially offset by receipts associated with the settlement of a pipeline rate proceeding during the year. We recorded other expense, net of $13 million in 2010 primarily as a result of a summary judgment award granted in late 2010 related to Chevron’s assertion that it was entitled to a share of our 2008 refund from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (“TAPS”).

Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $442 million in 2012 compared to $342 million in 2011 and $4 million in 2010. The combined federal and state effective income tax rates were 36%, 38%, and (16)% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $4 million of tax expense in 2010 included a $7 million charge related to health care legislation enacted in 2010.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 34 for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit agreements and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.

Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit. During 2012 and 2011, we had additional cash flows related to TLLP’s initial public offering of common units in 2011 (“TLLP’s Initial Offering”) and sales of assets to TLLP during 2012. We ended 2012 with $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings under the Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility or the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements. 

We expect to close the Carson Acquisition during the first half of 2013 and intend to fund the purchase with a combination of cash and debt, including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and a $500 million term loan credit facility. Additionally, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to allow for an increase in the capacity to $3.0 billion just prior to closing the Carson Acquisition. We intend to offer TLLP the integrated logistics system to be acquired in the Carson Acquisition in multiple transactions during the first twelve months following the closing of the Carson Acquisition, with a goal for the first transaction to coincide with the closing of the Carson Acquisition.

Credit Facilities Overview

We had available capacity under our credit agreements as follows at December 31, 2012 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)Subsequent to December 31, 2012, we entered into a term loan credit facility and amended our Revolving Credit Facility and the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 18, 2013, the total capacity under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility was $500 million. Just prior to closing the Carson Acquisition, the term loan credit facility will provide for $500 million of borrowing capacity and the amended Revolving Credit Facility provides for an increase in the capacity to $3.0 billion.

(b)Borrowing base is the lesser of the amount of the periodically adjusted borrowing base or the agreement’s total capacity.

As of December 31, 2012, our credit facilities were subject to the following expenses and fees:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(c)We have the option to elect if borrowings will bear interest at either a base rate plus the base rate margin, or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable period, plus, the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing. The applicable margin varies based upon our Revolving Credit Facility’s credit ratings. Letters of credit outstanding under the Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate. We also incur commitment fees for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at an annual rate. 

(d)TLLP has the option to elect if borrowings bear interest at either a base rate plus the base rate margin, or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable period, plus, the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing. The applicable margin varies based upon a certain leverage ratio, as defined by the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. TLLP incurs commitment fees for the unused portion of the TLLP Revolving Credit at an annual rate. In January 2013, TLLP amended this facility which among other things, decreases the borrowing rates under this facility. See additional information under TLLP Revolving Credit Facility below.

51
Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”)

At December 31, 2012, our Revolving Credit Facility provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base of approximately $3.5 billion, consisting of Tesoro’s eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories, net of the standard reserve as defined, or the Revolving Credit Facility’s total capacity of $1.85 billion. The total available capacity can be increased up to an aggregate amount of $2.25 billion, subject to receiving increased commitments. At December 31, 2012, we had unused credit availability of approximately 64% of the eligible borrowing base. 

Effective January 4, 2013, we entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which allows the capacity of our Revolving Credit Facility to be automatically increased to an aggregate of $3.0 billion, just prior to closing the Carson Acquisition (“Increase Effective Date”). Additionally, the agreement allows for us to request that the capacity be increased up to an aggregate of $4.0 billion, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders; however, we must offer to reduce the commitments by at least $500 million on or prior to the 18 month anniversary of the Increase Effective Date and by an additional $500 million on or prior to the two year anniversary of the Increase Effective Date. The Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and commitments thereunder will terminate, on January 4, 2018.

The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries excluding TLGP, TLLP and its subsidiaries, and certain foreign subsidiaries, and is secured by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries’ crude oil and refined product inventories, cash and receivables.

Our Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes retain various restrictions and covenants that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity capital, pay cash dividends, or purchase our common stock. The limitation in each of our debt agreements is based on limits on restricted payments, as defined in our debt agreements. The aggregate amount of restricted payments cannot exceed an amount defined in each of the debt agreements. The indentures for our senior notes contain covenants and restrictions, which are customary for notes of this nature. We do not believe that the limitations will restrict our ability to pay dividends or purchase stock under our current programs. These existing covenants and restrictions may limit, among other things, our ability to:

•pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase, redeem or retire our capital stock;

•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;

•voluntary repayments of subordinate debt;

•sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business;

•incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•engage in certain business activities;

•make certain payments and distributions from our subsidiaries;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

Borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, we have a default covenant, which requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. 

Letter of Credit Agreements

The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit agreements for foreign crude oil purchases. As of December 31, 2012, our five separate uncommitted letter of credit agreements had $637 million outstanding. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the crude oil inventories for which they are issued. Capacity under these letter of credit agreements is available on an uncommitted basis and can be terminated by either party, at any time.

52
TPSA Revolving Credit Facility

TPSA, a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Tesoro, entered into a 364-day uncommitted, secured revolving credit agreement in October 2011. Effective August 16, 2012, we terminated the TPSA revolving credit facility agreement. TPSA had no borrowings under the agreement at the time of termination and did not incur any early termination penalties.

Term Loan Credit Facility

Effective January 28, 2013, we entered into a term loan credit facility agreement (the “Term Loan Facility”) which allows us to borrow up to an aggregate of $500 million on or prior to August 9, 2013. The proceeds of the borrowing will be used to fund the contemplated Carson Acquisition and for other general corporate purposes. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility will be secured by all equity interests of Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC and Tesoro Alaska Company, the Tesoro and USA Gasoline trademarks and those trademarks containing the name “ARCO” that will be acquired by Tesoro in the Carson Acquisition, and junior liens on certain assets. 

Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% or a base rate plus 1.25%. We also incur a commitment fee commencing on March 1, 2013 on the term loan commitments. The Term Loan Facility matures three years from the initial borrowing. The Term Loan Facility will be subject to equal quarterly payments in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the initial borrowing with the final payment of all amounts outstanding due on the maturity date. 

The Term Loan Facility contains affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default substantially similar to those set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility and contains negative covenants substantially similar to those set forth in the indentures for the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2017 (“2017 Notes”) and 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (“2022 Notes”).

TLLP Revolving Credit Facility

TLLP entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions in April 2011. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP, and is guaranteed by all of TLLP’s subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of TLLP’s assets. As of December 31, 2012, the total loan availability under the TLLP Credit Facility was $300 million. Borrowings are available under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility up to the total available revolving capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2012, TLLP had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. 

Effective January 4, 2013, TLLP entered into an amended and restated senior secured revolving credit agreement, which increases total revolving loan availability under the facility from $300 million to $500 million and allows TLLP to request that the availability be increased up to an aggregate of $650 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. Further, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility decreases the Eurodollar margin and base rate margins under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility between 0.5% to 1.0%, depending on our leverage ratio, and includes a provision that allows a temporary increase in certain of TLLP’s financial covenants in the event of a material acquisition. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2017. 

The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility retains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict TLLP’s ability (as well as those of TLLP’s subsidiaries) to:

•incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•pay and make certain restricted payments; 

•make distributions from its subsidiaries;

•dispose of assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in its business;

•make certain amendments, modifications or supplements to organization documents and material contracts;

•engage in certain business activities;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

53
We do not believe that these limitations will restrict TLLP’s ability to pay distributions. Additionally, covenants require TLLP to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. TLLP was in compliance with all TLLP Revolving Credit Facility covenants and conditions as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. 

Capitalization

Our capital structure at December 31, 2012 was comprised of the following (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2012, our debt to capitalization ratio had decreased to 25% compared to 30% at December 31, 2011, reflecting a decrease in total debt and an increase in net earnings during 2012. The decrease in total debt reflects the reduction of all outstanding borrowings on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility, TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and the redemption of our 6.250% Senior Notes during 2012. The 6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and 6.500% Senior Notes due 2017 were refinanced through the issuance of the new 2017 Notes and 2022 Notes. This decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $350 million of Senior Notes due 2020 by TLLP during 2012. 

Our total debt to capitalization excluding TLLP was 23% and 31%, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which excludes TLLP total debt of $354 million and $50 million and noncontrolling interest of $486 million and $310 million as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. TLLP’s debt is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for Tesoro Logistics GP.

6.250% Senior Notes due 2012

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we redeemed all of our outstanding $299 million 6.250% Senior Notes due November 2012.

 4.250% Senior Notes due 2017 and 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022 

In September 2012, we issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2017 and $475 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022. The 2017 and 2022 Senior Notes contain terms, events of default and covenants that are customary for notes of this nature. These notes are unsecured obligations and guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, excluding TLGP and TLLP and its subsidiaries. 

6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and 6.500% Senior Notes due 2017

In conjunction with the issuance of the 2017 and 2022 Notes, we retired all of our $450 million outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and $473 million outstanding 6.500% Senior Notes due 2017. The aggregate purchase price for these notes totaled approximately $970 million including accrued interest and premiums of $24 million and $23 million, respectively. In addition, we expensed $4 million of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs on these notes.

5.875% TLLP Senior Notes due 2020 

TLLP completed a private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes, due October 2020 in September 2012. The proceeds were used to fund TLLP’s acquisition of the Long Beach Assets, to repay the outstanding balance on the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and to fund a portion of the acquisition of the Anacortes Rail Facility.

54
The TLLP 2020 Notes are subject to a registration rights agreement under which TLLP has agreed to exchange the notes for registered publicly-traded notes having substantially identical terms as the TLLP 2020 Notes. The TLLP 2020 Notes also contain customary terms, events of default and covenants. The TLLP 2020 Notes are unsecured and guaranteed by all of TLLP’s domestic subsidiaries, except Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp., the co-issuer of the TLLP 2020 Notes. The TLLP 2020 Notes are non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP.

Share Repurchase Programs 

In August 2012, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Under the program, management is permitted to purchase Tesoro common stock at its discretion in the open market. The authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We purchased approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million during 2012 under this share repurchase program. Additionally, in January and February 2013, we purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for approximately $55 million under this share repurchase program. 

During 2011, our Board approved a program designed to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards. As a result, we purchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $24.81 per share for approximately $26 million during 2012, and 4.7 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $20.19 per share for approximately $95 million during 2011. 

Cash Dividends

In August 2012, our Board authorized the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend and approved an initial dividend payment of $0.12 per share. In October 2012, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share. During 2012, we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $0.27 per share, or $38 million. We did not pay any cash dividends during 2011 or 2010. On February 5, 2013, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.20 per share. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2013 to holders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2013. 

Cash Flow Summary

Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2012 Compared to 2011

Net cash from operating activities increased $896 million, or 130%, to $1.6 billion in 2012, as compared to $689 million in 2011. The increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in inventories of approximately 1.5 million barrels during 2012 compared to a significant increase in inventories of approximately 4.1 million barrels during 2011, as well as higher net earnings of $207 million in 2012, which includes a non-cash impairment charge of $228 million related to our Hawaii refinery. Net cash used in investing activities increased $405 million, or 139% to $696 million in 2012 as compared to $291 million in 2011 due to increased cash capital expenditures of $231 million as a result of our 2012 capital programs. We also made advance payments to secure the Carson Acquisition and TLLP’s acquisition of the Northwest Products System of $90 million and $40 million, respectively, and paid $37 million to acquire 49 retail stations from SUPERVALU, Inc. during 2012. 

55
Net cash used in financing activities increased $4 million from $146 million in 2011 to $150 million in 2012. The primary use of cash during 2012 was the redemption of the remaining 6.250% Senior Notes outstanding for $299 million, the purchase of common stock for approximately $131 million, total net repayments on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility and TLLP Revolving Credit Facility of $167 million, and dividend payments of $38 million. Sources of cash during 2012 include proceeds from TLLP’s issuance of $350 million aggregate principal amount 5.875% Senior Notes and proceeds from TLLP’s issuance of its common units of $171 million. In addition, we issued $925 million aggregate principal amount senior notes, to refinance the remaining outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes. Net cash used in financing activities during 2011 is comprised of $178 million for the redemption of a portion of the 6.250% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes, $150 million for the redemption of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the purchase of common stock for $101 million, and a reduction in borrowings under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility of $33 million, offset by proceeds from TLLP’s Initial Offering of $288 million. 

On the balance sheet, working capital (excluding cash) increased $114 million in 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in current maturities of debt during 2012, including the redemption of the $299 million remaining 6.250% Senior Notes due 2012 and net repayments of $117 million of short-term borrowings on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in inventories of approximately 1.5 million barrels during 2012, and increases in accrued liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee costs and tax liabilities. 

2011 Compared to 2010

Net cash from operating activities increased $304 million, or 79%, to $689 million in 2011 as compared to $385 million in 2010 primarily due to higher cash earnings. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4 million, or 1% to $291 million in 2011 as compared to $295 million in 2010 primarily due to a decrease in cash outflows for capital expenditures. Financing activities provided sources of cash of $145 million in 2010 and uses of cash of $146 million in 2011 for a decrease in cash flows from financing activities of $291 million from 2010 to 2011. In 2011, net cash outflows from financing activities include debt repurchases of $328 million, stock purchases of $95 million and $37 million in financing costs and other that is primarily related to premiums paid on the debt repurchases. These outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common units related to TLLP of $288 million and net borrowings under revolving credit agreements of $17 million. In 2010, net cash inflows from financing activities were primarily related to net borrowings under revolving credit agreements of $150 million.

Working capital requirements (excluding cash) increased $218 million in 2011, primarily related to significant increases in crude oil and product prices, which impact inventory values, related payables and trade receivables. Additionally, refining feedstock inventories increased by approximately 18% from December 31, 2010, which are partially offset by net repayments of $33 million of short-term borrowings on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility, and an increase in current maturities of short term debt related to the 6.250% Senior Notes, which were scheduled to mature within the next twelve months.

Capital Expenditures

The cost estimates for capital expenditures, including environmental projects, described below are subject to further review and analysis and permitting requirements. Our capital spending plans include the following major projects (in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)The cost estimates for capital expenditures exclude estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs. 

(b)2012 actual capital expenditure disclosures include capitalized interest and labor costs associated with the project.

(c)The expansion project at the Utah refinery is designed to improve yields of gasoline and diesel, improve the flexibility of processing crude feedstocks, and increase throughput capacity by 4 Mbpd, and is expected to be completed in 2 phases. 

(d)The power reliability improvement project is designed to upgrade the Utah refinery electrical infrastructure to current standards. In addition, the upgrade will support the refinery expansion project. 

(e)The capital improvements to our Avon marine wharf facility involve replacing the dock structures and fire protection equipment. The upgraded facility will allow us to increase our ability to move products from our Martinez refinery, thus supporting higher utilization of our refining assets.

(f)The Anacortes Rail Facility supplies Bakken crude oil from North Dakota to our Washington refinery. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we sold the Anacortes Rail Facility to TLLP.

(g)The vacuum distillation unit replacement at the Wilmington refinery will upgrade product yield from petroleum coke to clean products.

(h)The expansion project at the North Dakota refinery increased throughput capacity from 58 Mbpd to 68 Mbpd in 2012. The expansion allows the refinery to process additional Bakken crude oil delivered via the TLLP High Plains System. 

(i)The expansion of the diesel desulfurization unit is expected to increase capacity of the unit from 17 Mbpd to 22 Mbpd and improve diesel fuel yield at the North Dakota refinery.

(j)Involves the rebranding of retail stations in southern California leased from Thrifty Oil Co. and certain of its affiliates. We transitioned 174 of these stations during 2012 with the remaining stations to be phased in during 2014.

(k)Involves the replacement of dispensers and rebranding of the 49 retail stations acquired from SUPERVALU, Inc. in the first quarter of 2012. We paid approximately $37 million for the assets, including inventories of approximately $3 million. 

Our capital spending during 2012 was $559 million. Our capital spending budget for 2013 of $530 million reflects the Company’s emphasis on long term strategic priorities including continued focus on safety and reliability and greater focus on value-driven growth. Our 2013 budgeted and 2012 actual capital spending amounts are comprised of the following project categories at December 31, 2012:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

57
Refinery Turnaround Spending

Our 2013 budget for refinery turnarounds and catalyst is $310 million. The turnaround spending is expected to be primarily at our Martinez, Washington, Wilmington and Utah refineries. Refining throughput and yields in 2013 will be affected by these turnarounds. During 2012, we spent $261 million for refinery turnarounds and catalysts, primarily at our Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, Martinez and Wilmington refineries.

Environmental Capital Expenditures

The EPA issued regulations in February 2007 that require the reduction of benzene in gasoline. We spent approximately $11 million in 2012 to complete projects at our Alaska, Hawaii and Utah refineries to comply with the regulations. This completes the capital spending required to meet these standards.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than our leasing arrangements described in Note Q to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

Environmental and Other Matters

We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable third-party recoveries.

We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls, or make other modifications to certain emission sources, equipment or facilities.

Future expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our refineries, tank farms, pipelines, and currently and previously owned or operated terminal and retail station properties. The impact of these legislative and regulatory developments, including any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program or low carbon fuel standards, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In 2009, the EPA proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The first of these regulations, finalized on April 1, 2010, set standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars. It could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels. In addition, other finalized regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold. The resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries. We cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

In December 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted into federal law, which created a second Renewable Fuels Standard (“RFS2”). This standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 16.6 billion gallons in 2013 and to increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture. In the near term, the RFS2 presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol, alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries. We are currently meeting the RFS2 requirements through a combination of blending renewable fuels obtained from third parties and purchases of Renewable Identification Numbers in the open market that are generated by third parties. Additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels. While we cannot currently estimate the ultimate impact of this legislation, and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity, the ultimate outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations. 

58
In California, Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”), created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and a low carbon fuel standard (“LCFS”) to achieve emissions reduction targets. The LCFS became effective in January 2010 and requires a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. In 2011, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approved cap-and-trade requirements, and all of AB 32 related regulations are to be fully implemented by 2020. In December 2011, a court ruled the LCFS unconstitutional. CARB has appealed the decision. On April 23, 2012, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the lower court’s preliminary injunction of CARB’s enforcement of the standard pending the appeal. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the court’s ruling on the LCFS, and the implementation and implications of AB 32 will take many years to realize. Consequently, we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result in increased expenditures in the future. We are also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities. We believe that resolution of any such claim(s) would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.

Environmental Liabilities

We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments, and it is possible that our projections will change, and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available. 

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled $86 million and $93 million, respectively. These accruals include $54 million and $55 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to environmental liabilities for site cleanup activities assumed from a prior owner, arising from operations at our Martinez refinery prior to August 2000. Of the $54 million accrued at December 31, 2012, approximately $45 million is subject to a cost-share agreement where we are responsible for 75% of the expenditures. We cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the Martinez refinery. Therefore, it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and remediation costs as more information becomes available. We have filed insurance claims under environmental insurance policies. These policies provide coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of $50 million in self-insurance, but the insurer has challenged coverage and filed a declaratory relief action in federal court. We have not recognized possible insurance recoveries related to this matter. 

We have investigated conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Martinez refinery. The investigation was driven by an order received in 2004 from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The order named us as well as two previous owners of the Martinez refinery. We cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order, but we believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Washington Refinery Fire

In April 2010, the naphtha hydrotreater unit at our Washington refinery was involved in a fire, which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable. Subsequent to the incident, refinery processing was temporarily shut down until November 2010 when the reconstruction was completed. 

In July 2012, we settled all claims brought by the estates and families of the seven fatally injured employees and a third-party truck driver (Donald and Peggy Zimmerman et al. v. Tesoro Corporation and Tesoro Refining and Marketing et al.). The resolution of these claims did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

We maintain comprehensive property (including business interruption), workers’compensation, and general liability insurance policies with significant loss limits. Our business interruption insurance deductible is satisfied after we have exceeded both 60 days of operational disruption and $25 million in losses primarily based on the operating plan that existed prior to the incident. Our property damage insurance has a $10 million deductible. 

59
We have filed business interruption insurance claims and property damage claims related to down time from this incident. We collected $87 million in business interruption insurance recoveries that relate to down time from the incident, which were recorded as an offset to cost of sales in our statements of consolidated operations. Of the $87 million collected, $32 million was recorded in 2011 and $55 million was recorded in 2010. We received $17 million to settle the property damage claim filed for this incident, which was recorded as a reduction to operating expense in our statements of consolidated operations. Of the $17 million, $5 million was recorded in 2011 and $12 million was recorded in 2010. As of December 31, 2012, all property damage claims have been settled but certain business interruption claims remain open.

Other Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have not established accruals for these matters unless a loss is probable, and the amount of loss is currently estimable. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations.

In October 2011, MF Global Holding Ltd. (“MF Global”), a broker-dealer we used for derivatives transactions, announced filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York. We ceased doing business with MF Global and liquidated all accounts during 2011. In July 2012, we contracted to sell the remaining $24 million in cash collateral held by MF Global for approximately $21 million.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Financial Reform Act of 2010, was enacted into federal law. Key provisions of the act require that standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements. These requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting, capital, and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities. Final rules implementing this statute were deferred until mid-2013. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these rules which may result in increased hedging costs and cash collateral requirements, we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Legal

We are a defendant, along with other manufacturing, supply and marketing defendants, in two remaining lawsuits alleging methyl tertiary butyl ether (“MTBE”) contamination in groundwater. The defendants are being sued for having manufactured MTBE and having manufactured, supplied and distributed gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs in the remaining cases, all in California, are municipalities and governmental authorities. The plaintiffs allege, in part, that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees. We intend to vigorously assert our defenses against these claims. While we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of these matters, we have established an accrual for them and believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

During 2009, Chevron filed a lawsuit against us claiming they are entitled to a share of the refunds we received in 2008 from the owners of TAPS. We received $50 million in 2008, net of contingent legal fees, for excessive intrastate rates charged by TAPS during 1997 through 2000, and the period of 2001 through June 2003. Chevron is asserting that it is entitled to a share of its portion of the refunds for retroactive price adjustments under our previous crude oil contracts with them. The trial court judge granted Chevron’s motion for summary judgment and awarded them $16 million, including interest, in September 2010. We disagree with the trial court and have appealed the decision to the Alaska Supreme Court in which the proceeding is now pending. We have established an accrual for this matter and believe its resolution will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

60
Environmental

On October 15, 2012, certain non-governmental organizations filed a Request for Agency Action (the “Request”) with the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) concerning our Utah refinery. The Request challenges the UDEQ’s permitting of our refinery conversion project alleging that the permits do not conform to the requirements of the Clean Air Act. As the permittee, we are the “real party in interest” and will be defending the permits with UDEQ. While we are still evaluating the Request and cannot estimate the timing or estimated amount, if any, associated with the outcome, we do not believe it will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The EPA has alleged that we have violated certain Clean Air Act regulations at our Alaska, Washington, Martinez, Hawaii and Utah refineries. We are continuing discussions of the EPA’s claims with the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). We previously received a notice of violation (“NOV”) in March 2011 from the EPA alleging violations of Title V of the Clean Air Act at our Alaska refinery. The alleged violations in the NOV arise from a 2007 state of Alaska inspection and inspections by the EPA in 2008 and 2010. We also previously received NOVs in 2005 and 2008 alleging violations of the Clean Air Act at our Washington refinery. We are discussing all of these allegations with the EPA and DOJ. The ultimate resolution of these matters could require us to incur material capital expenditures and/or civil penalties. While we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of these matters, and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, the ultimate resolution could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations.

Long-Term Commitments

Contractual Commitments

We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes M and Q to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to TLLP under our various fee-based commercial agreements as these related-party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings.

(b)Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)Represents primarily long-term commitments for the transportation of crude oil and refined products as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contract’s minimum volume requirements.

(e)Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.

We also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Note P, Note Q and Note N, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

61
In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits, with the exception of amounts classified as current, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded from the table $12 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $5 million at December 31, 2012. See Note O to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Pension Funding

We provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees, with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 7.00% as of December 31, 2012, and the return on our funded employee pension plan assets was $34 million in 2012 and $28 million in 2011. Based on a 4.06% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2012, the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 51% of the projected benefit obligation. On July 6, 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”) was signed into law which, includes provisions for pension funding relief for plan sponsors by stabilizing the interest rates plan sponsors use to determine their pension funding requirements. Previous funding rules required using a discount rate based on a two-year average of high quality corporate bond rates to determine pension liabilities and minimum contributions. The new legislation also stipulates that the discount rate falls within a 10% corridor of a 25-year average corporate bond rate. The corridor will grow 5% per year. The provisions of MAP-21 are effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. On this new MAP-21 basis, at January 1, 2012 the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations) was 108%. Tesoro contributed $48 million during 2012, a portion of which was in excess of the minimum required. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, discount rates, employee demographics, regulatory environments and other factors. See Note P to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.

62
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note A to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Receivables — Our trade receivables are stated at their invoiced amounts, less an allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts. We monitor the credit and payment experience of our customers and manage our loss exposure through our credit policies and procedures. The estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our general loss experience and identified loss exposures on individual accounts. Actual losses could vary from estimates as global economic conditions and the related credit environment could change.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles — We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental requirements could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. 

We evaluate these assets for potential impairment when an asset disposition is probable or when there are indicators of impairment (for example, current period operating losses combined with a history of operating losses or a temporary shutdown of a refinery) and, if so, assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset’s net book value exceeds its fair market value. Fair market value is based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. At December 31, 2012, we evaluated certain of our refineries for potential impairment. See Notes C and J to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from the analysis.

Goodwill — As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had a goodwill balance of $36 million. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist for the underlying assets. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. An impairment charge would be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value.

We review the recorded value of our goodwill for impairment annually on November 1st, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. A quantitative approach was used to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in years prior to the period ending December 31, 2011. Our goodwill testing in 2012 and 2011 involved a qualitative approach. As part of our qualitative assessments, we evaluated economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity specific and reporting unit events. We assessed our overall financial performance and considered other factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products including: crude oil prices, increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles, or other legislation that could have negative implications. We determined the relevance of any entity-specific events or events affecting our reporting units which would have a negative effect on the carrying value of the reporting units. Accordingly, no additional quantitative testing was performed and no goodwill impairment charges were recognized in 2012 or 2011.

63
Environmental Liabilities — At December 31, 2012 and 2011, our total environmental liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities were $86 million and $93 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Usually, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties. 

Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. We do not discount our estimated liabilities to present value.

Legal Liabilities — In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, and governmental investigations. These matters may involve large or unspecified damages or penalties that may be sought from us and may require years to resolve. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The liability is recorded for an amount that is management’s best estimate of the loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss amount of a range of possible outcomes. Significant judgment is required in estimating such liabilities, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results.

Income Taxes — As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. We must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $8 million on certain state credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2012, based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. We may need to establish an additional valuation allowance if actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods. 

We also recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that are not recognized that we have taken or expect to take are generally recorded as liabilities. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties totaled $17 million and $20 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations — Our asset retirement obligations totaled $46 million and $26 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We record asset retirement obligations in the period in which we have a legal obligation, whether by government action or contractual arrangement, to incur this liability and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. When the liability is initially recorded, the cost is capitalized by increasing the book value of the related long-lived tangible asset. The liability is accreted through operating expenses to its estimated settlement value and the related capitalized cost is depreciated over the asset’s useful life.

We use the present value of expected cash flows using third-party estimates or historical data to estimate fair value. The calculation of fair value is based on several estimates and assumptions, including inflation, a discount rate, the settlement dates or a range of potential settlement dates and the probabilities associated with settlement. We consider our past practice, industry practice, management’s intent and estimated economic lives to estimate settlement dates. Our estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the retirement and technological improvements associated with the retirement activities. 

We cannot currently make reasonable estimates of the fair values of some retirement obligations, principally those associated with our refineries, pipelines and certain terminals and retail stations, because the related assets have indeterminate useful lives which preclude development of assumptions about the potential timing of settlement dates. Such obligations will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates.

64
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits — Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status or a liability if the plans are underfunded. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans’ assets and its projected benefit obligations. While we believe the assumptions we used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to the effective yields on high quality corporate bonds that have a comparable cash flow pattern to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the funded qualified employee retirement plan would have had the following effects in 2012 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note P to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.

Stock-Based Compensation — We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and certain other stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions including the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term, and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as outlined above; however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and impact of the possible differing stock price paths. Changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock-based awards. The fair values of our stock appreciation rights, phantom stock options and performance units are estimated at the end of each reporting period and are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our assumptions may impact our liabilities and expenses associated with our stock-based awards.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) in July 2012 related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. This ASU provides the option to assess qualitative factors first to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. If the company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The company can choose to assess qualitative factors on none, some or all of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. However, an entity can choose to early adopt the standard, provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2012 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements. Our indefinite lived intangible assets are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

The FASB issued an ASU in June 2011, regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. This ASU eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity. Instead, the company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, which contains two sections, net income and OCI, or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted these presentation requirements and are presenting components of OCI in two consecutive statements. 

Additionally, the FASB issued an ASU in February 2013 that provides entities the option of presenting information related to reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements for items that are reclassified from OCI to net income in the statement where those components are presented. The requirements from the new ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of these requirements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

The FASB issued an ASU in December 2011, which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. In January 2013, the FASB amended and clarified the scope of the disclosures to include only derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions. The provisions for this ASU are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, but may result in additional disclosures.
