Item 1. Business

Our Business

Omnicom, which was formed in 1986, is a strategic holding company and a leading global provider of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services. We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global advertising and marketing services companies, as well as other independent companies. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums, has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to global service providers such as Omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditure.

Our branded networks and agencies, which operate in all major markets around the world, provide a comprehensive range of services in four fundamental disciplines: advertising, customer relationship management, or CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines, we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing client-specific advertising and marketing services. Services included in these four disciplines are:

Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. The fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients. As clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency, they have tended to consolidate their business with larger, multi-disciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies. Accordingly, our business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements. We believe that this organizational philosophy, and our ability to execute it, differentiates us from our competitors.

 Our networks and agencies that comprise our virtual client networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies, meaning that the delivery of our services can, and does, take place across agencies, networks and geographic regions simultaneously. Further, we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for our services. Our over-arching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients.

The various components of our business, including revenue by discipline and geographic area, and material factors that affected us in 2015 are discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or MD&A, of this report. None of the acquisitions or dispositions, individually or in the aggregate, in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 was material to our results of operations or financial position. For information about our acquisitions, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Geographic Regions

In 2015, our United States operations represented approximately 56% of our revenue. As discussed more fully in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A, our branded networks and agencies conduct business on a global basis and operate in the following geographic regions: The Americas, which includes North America and Latin America; EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and, Asia Pacific, which includes Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and other Asian countries. The networks have regional reporting units that are responsible for the agencies in their region. Agencies within the regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients and have similar economic characteristics. Accordingly, we provide financial information by geographic region in the MD&A and in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and segment information in Note 7.

Our Clients

Our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy. In many cases, multiple agencies or networks serve different brand and/or product groups within the same client. For example, in 2015, our largest client, which represented 2.7% of revenue, was served by more than 250 of our agencies and our 100 largest clients, which represented approximately 52% of revenue, were each served, on average, by more than 50 of our agencies.

Our Employees

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 74,900 people. The skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar. Common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience. Recognizing the importance of this core competency, we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency. See the MD&A for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations.
