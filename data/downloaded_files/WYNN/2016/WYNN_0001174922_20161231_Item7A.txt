Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risks

One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies have had the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments as of December 31, 2016, of our expected long-term indebtedness and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. As of December 31, 2016, such rates remain at historic lows. Actual rates will vary. The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2016 of 0.77% and 0.75%, respectively, were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below.

The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents as applicable.

Interest Rate Swap Information

We have entered into floating-for-fixed interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of our floating-rate debt facilities. We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as a change in interest rate swap fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

We currently have three interest rate swap agreements intended to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under our Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under two of the swap agreements, we pay a fixed interest rate (excluding the applicable interest margin) of 0.73% on notional amounts corresponding to borrowings of HK$3.95 billion (approximately $509.4 million) in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. These interest rate swaps fix the all-in interest rate on such amounts at 2.23% to 2.98%. These interest rate swap agreements mature in July 2017.

Under the third swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate (excluding the applicable interest margin) of 0.68% on notional amounts corresponding to borrowings of $243.8 million in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. This interest rate swap fixes the all-in interest rate on such amounts at 2.18% to 2.93%. This interest rate swap agreement matures in July 2017.

As of December 31, 2016, interest rate swaps of $1.1 million were included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2015, interest rate swaps of $0.7 million were included in other assets and $0.1 million were included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The fair value approximates the amount we would pay or receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.

Other Interest Rate Swap Information

The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps, by contractual maturity dates, as of December 31, 2016, using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is our reporting currency:

We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

As of December 31, 2016, approximately 66.5% of our debt was based on fixed rates, including the notional amounts related to interest rate swaps. Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2016, an assumed 1% change in the variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $34.6 million.

Foreign Currency Risks

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau SA's concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

We manage exposure to foreign currency risks associated with future scheduled interest payments through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and are with a counter party, which is a major international financial institution.

We expect most of the revenues and expenses for any casino that we operate in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars or Macau patacas. For any U.S. dollar-denominated debt or other obligations incurred by our Macau-related entities, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service debt. Based on our balances as of December 31, 2016, an assumed 1% change in the US dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of approximately $28.2 million.
