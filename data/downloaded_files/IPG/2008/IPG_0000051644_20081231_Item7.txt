Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company, Interpublic, we, us or our). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our MD&A includes the following sections:  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a description of our business strategy as well as an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds.  

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a description of accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our future operations.  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

We are one of the worlds premier global advertising and marketing services companies. Our agencies create marketing programs for clients to improve business results for them and generate sales, earnings and cash flow for us. Our agencies deliver services across the full spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, including advertising, direct marketing, public relations, mobile marketing, internet and search engine marketing, social media marketing, and media buying and planning. Major global brands in our portfolio of companies include Draftfcb, FutureBrand, GolinHarris, Initiative, Jack Morton, Lowe, McCann Erickson, Momentum, MRM, Octagon, Universal McCann and Weber Shandwick. Leading domestic brands include Campbell-Ewald, Carmichael Lynch, Deutsch, Hill Holliday, The Martin Agency, Mullen and R/GA.  

In early 2006, the senior management team of Interpublic announced a three-year strategic plan to return the company to competitive growth and significantly enhance profitability, while concurrently addressing a range of legacy issues stemming largely from previous under-investment in talent and shortcomings in our financial control environment. The first two years of this plan saw us invest to strengthen leadership and talent at the parent company and across our agencies, including programs to foster diversity and inclusion throughout our organization, and we strategically realigned and refocused certain key operating units. We also enhanced the companys financial strength, liquidity and flexibility and succeeded in remediating the weaknesses in our internal control structure. Progress in all of these areas led to significantly improved financial performance. During 2008, the third year of our program, we continued to build on our momentum, achieving organic revenue growth that was fully competitive with that of our global peer group, and operating margins significantly higher than we reported in 2005, preceding the implementation of our strategic plan.  

The global economic environment in which we operate deteriorated significantly over the course of 2008, at first relatively slowly, then accelerating in the latter part of the year. We believe that our performance in this challenging environment further reflects the success of our turnaround strategies. For 2009 and beyond, our strategic outlook is for a media landscape that continues to grow more complex, and that our high-quality,

 comprehensive global services will remain critical to the competitiveness of our clients. Our objectives are to continue to build our talent across the full range of marketing competencies, while focusing our investment on the fastest growing markets and disciplines. Our financial objectives include furthering our margin progress to achieve peer-level operating margin over the long term. Accordingly, we remain focused on cost control and resource utilization, including the productivity of our employees, real estate and information technology.  

We begin 2009 with the global economy in recession and widespread uncertainty in financial markets, which has made business conditions more challenging for nearly all companies. It is apparent that these conditions will adversely affect the demand for advertising and marketing services in 2009, and, as a result, present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of our company and our sector. While we cannot predict the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn or its impact on the demand for our services, we believe that we will continue to derive benefits from our diversified client base, global presence and broad range of services. Recent improvements in our financial reporting and business information systems provide us with timely and actionable insights from our businesses around the world. Our extensive operating improvements over the past three years have greatly strengthened our cash flow generation, and our balance sheet and liquidity are important sources of financial flexibility. These should provide a measure of protection in a harsh business environment.  

Highlights  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and consider the remainder to be the organic change. For purposes of analyzing this change, acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. During the past few years, we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offering and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. For additional information on our acquisitions, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. An analysis of 2008 compared to 2007 shows net acquisitions increased revenue and operating expenses, while an analysis of 2007 compared to 2006 shows net divestitures decreased revenue and operating expenses. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector and geographic region. In our business sector analysis, we focused on our top 100 clients, which represent over 50% of our consolidated revenue.

On July 9, 2008 we announced the creation of a management entity called Mediabrands to oversee our media assets that are included in our Integrated Agency Networks (IAN) segment. The new entity provides oversight to ensure operational efficiency and increased collaboration across our media units. Our global media networks, Initiative and Universal McCann, continue to operate as independent entities, each aligned where appropriate with a full-service marketing network partner. The businesses that comprise Mediabrands remain in the IAN segment. The financial results for these units are analyzed together in the MD&A for 2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006.  

Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk. As a result, both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar will continue to affect our results of operations. Foreign currency fluctuations resulted in increases of approximately 1% in revenues and operating expenses which resulted in an increase of approximately 4% in operating income for 2008 as compared to 2007. In the second half of the year the U.S. Dollar strengthened against several foreign currencies, and if this trend continues, it could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and notes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Revenue Recognition  

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising, marketing and communications programs in various media around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.  

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred. There are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are project-based and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs.  

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements, because of various pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, we assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing) where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses. Revenue is reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.  

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.  

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned. Negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement could result in either payments to the client in excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual liability. These items, referred to as concessions, relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as operating expense or income. Concession income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in September 2005 (the 2004 Restatement). In these situations, and given the historical nature of these liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating results.

Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes.  

Under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. SFAS 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. In circumstances where there is significant negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS 109. A pattern of sustained profitability is considered significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings. In 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of $48.0, $22.3 and $29.6, respectively.  

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold and then we apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

We account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.  

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1st of each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 16   

19

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 reporting units subject to the 2008 annual impairment testing that are either entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1, 2008 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units. During 2008, we added a reporting unit due to a recent acquisition and changed the structure of certain reporting units due to the creation of Mediabrands. Besides the aforementioned changes, our reporting unit structure has not changed from 2007.  

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.  

SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), specifies a two-step process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.  

The fair value of a reporting unit for 2008 was estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method. In prior years, we have used a combination of the income approach and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. However, due to the deterioration and extreme volatility of the credit markets in the latter part of 2008, we determined that the market approach was not appropriate. Therefore, we used only the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units in 2008. This approach uses projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions for each reporting unit as to matters such as revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. These estimates and assumptions will vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. Our discount rates used for our reporting units for our 2008 annual impairment review were between 11% and 15.5%. We believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in a discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.  

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 0.5% and increases discount rates by 0.5% and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 0.5% and decreases discount rates by 0.5%. For purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test we use the average of our range of values.  

The following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2008 and 2007 annual impairment reviews and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end, average and high end of

 the valuation range for a) fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10%, b) fair values between 10% and 20% above carrying value, c) fair values more than 20% above carrying value and d) carrying values that exceed fair value.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  1  For purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test we used the average of our range of values.  

  2  In accordance with SFAS 142, we did not test certain reporting units in 2007 because we determined we could carry forward the fair value of the reporting unit from the last test, as the fair value significantly exceeded the book value.  

During the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2008 our stock price declined significantly after our annual impairment review date, and our market capitalization was less than our book value as of December 31, 2008. We considered whether there were any events or circumstances indicative of a triggering event and determined that the decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter was an event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our individual reporting units below their book value, requiring us to perform an interim impairment test for goodwill at the reporting unit level. Based on the interim impairment test conducted, we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2008. However, current economic conditions could continue or worsen in 2009 and could alter the assumptions we made with respect to our discounted cash flow models as of December 31, 2008. Therefore, we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and the fair values of our individual reporting units throughout 2009.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits  

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. These assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events. 

The discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impacts our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations. For the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, we determine our discount rate based on the estimated rate at which annuity contracts could be purchased to effectively settle the respective benefit obligations. To assist in this we utilize a yield curve based on Moodys Aa-rated corporate non-callable bonds. Each plans projected cash flow is matched to this yield curve and a present value is developed, which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate. For the foreign pension plans, we determine a discount rate by referencing market yields on high quality corporate bonds in the local markets with the appropriate term as of December 31, 2008. For 2009, we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 6.01%, 5.38% and 6.00% for the domestic pension plans, foreign plans and the postretirement plan, respectively. Changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in long-term interest rates. A higher discount rate will decrease our pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2008 net pension and postretirement cost by $2.1 and $2.2, respectively. In addition, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2008 benefit obligation by $17.3 and $18.0, respectively.  

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. For the domestic pension plans, our expected rate of return considers the historical trends of asset class index returns over various market cycles and economic conditions, current market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then attempt to select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities. For the foreign pension plans, primarily the U.K. Pension Plan, we determine the expected rate of return by utilizing a weighted average approach based on the current long-term expected rates of return for each asset category. The long-term expected rate of return for the equity category is based on the current long-term rates of return available on government bonds and applying suitable risk premiums that consider historical market returns and current market expectations. For 2009, we plan to use weighted average expected rates of return of 8.16% and 5.05% for the domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. Changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. A lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2008 net pension cost by $1.0. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Consolidated Results of Operations  

REVENUE  

Our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and retain existing ones, and spending levels of all our clients. Our revenue is also subject to fluctuations related to seasonal spending by our clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal holiday spending of our clients, incentives earned at year-end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. Additionally, revenues can fluctuate throughout the year due to the timing of completed projects in the events marketing business, as revenue is typically recognized when the

 project is complete. Furthermore, we generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2008 our revenue increased by $408.5, consisting of organic revenue growth of $249.4, led by the technology and telecommunications sector and the retail sector. The domestic organic growth was primarily driven by expanding business with existing clients and winning new clients in the advertising, media and public relations businesses. The international organic increase occurred throughout all regions. The increase in the United Kingdom was primarily due to the completion of several projects with existing clients and net client wins in the events marketing business and winning new clients in the advertising business. The international growth was also driven by increased client spending and net client wins primarily in Brazil, China and Spain.  

The deteriorating economic conditions in the latter part of 2008 negatively impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our revenue decreased by 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, which reflects an organic revenue decrease for the quarter of 2.2%. If weak global economic conditions persist in 2009, our revenues may remain under pressure across many of our service offerings and client sectors.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2007 our revenue increased by $363.4, consisting of organic revenue growth of $236.6 and favorable foreign currency rate impact of $197.5. The domestic organic growth was primarily driven through expanding business with existing clients, winning new clients in advertising and public relations and completing several projects within the events marketing business. The international organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases in spending by existing clients in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by net client losses in Continental Europe, primarily in France.

OPERATING EXPENSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 when compared to 2007. We consider the change in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, which we refer to as operating expense leverage, to be a key performance metric.  

Our staff cost ratio, defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue, declined to 62.4% in 2008 from 63.2% in 2007. The improvement was driven by higher revenues and better utilization of base salaries and benefits expenses. Our office and general expense ratio, defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue, declined to 28.9% in 2008 from 31.2% in 2007. This improvement was also driven by higher revenue and by a reduction in key expense categories, primarily professional fees.  

Salaries and Related Expenses  

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including cash bonus and long-term incentive stock awards, and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development, changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future period expense as bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and long-term incentive stock awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. Other factors impacting the expense associated with long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting and the change in our stock price. Additionally, changes can occur based on projected results and could impact trends between periods in the future.

The following table details our salary and related expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related expenses in 2008 increased by $203.4, compared to 2007, consisting of an organic salary increase of $103.2, net acquisitions of $59.4 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $40.8. The organic increase was primarily to support business growth (an organic revenue increase of $249.4) during 2008, resulting in higher base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $100.4, predominantly at our largest networks. There was no significant change in incentive award expense compared to the prior year as stock-based compensation expense was unchanged, and annual bonus award expense decreased by $15.1.  

As economic conditions deteriorated in the latter part of 2008, we took measures to realign our businesses, resulting in severance charges of $48.4 in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of $16.4 over the comparable prior year period. These expenses were spread across multiple business units and geographic regions.  

Salaries and related expenses in 2007 increased by $195.1, compared to 2006, consisting of an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $122.2 and an organic salary increase of $105.4. The organic increase was primarily to support business growth (an organic revenue increase of $236.6) resulting in higher base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $99.1, predominantly at our largest networks. Additionally, incentive awards increased by $31.7, primarily due to improved operating performance versus financial targets at certain operating units, higher stock-based compensation awards due to the effect of equity awards granted in June 2006 and a one-time performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the Company. These increases were offset by a decrease in severance expense of $22.4.  

Office and General Expenses  

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff, and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.

The following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue. All other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses and to a smaller extent depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, foreign currency gains (losses) and other expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Office and general expenses in 2008 decreased by $31.5 compared to 2007, including an organic decrease of $53.7. The organic improvement was primarily due to reductions in professional fees, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization as well as a higher focus on managing discretionary expenses. The organic decrease in professional fees of $29.0 was primarily due to reduced legal consultations as a result of the resolution of the SEC investigation and further improvements in our financial systems, back office processes and internal controls. Occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization declined and there were favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 when compared to 2007. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of $33.6 related to higher pass-through costs for certain projects where we act as principal and an increase in bad debt expense related to collection concerns for certain clients.  

Office and general expenses in 2007 decreased by $34.2 compared to 2006, consisting of an organic decrease of $56.4 and net divestitures of $43.8, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $66.0. The organic decrease was primarily due to improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes and internal controls we made throughout 2007 that resulted in a reduction in professional fees of $75.8. Additionally, occupancy costs, including depreciation and amortization, declined by $13.6. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of $34.2 related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal during 2007.  

Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges  

The components of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Restructuring charges relate to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at Lowe Worldwide (Lowe) during the third quarter of 2007. Included in these net charges are adjustments primarily resulting from severance and termination costs and accelerated leasehold amortization for the 2007 program at Lowe and changes in managements estimates relating to sublease rental income assumptions and prior severance and termination related actions.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

Other reorganization-related charges relate to our realignment of our media businesses into a newly created management entity called Mediabrands and the 2006 merger of Draft Worldwide and Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create Draftfcb. Charges relate to severance and terminations costs and lease termination and other exit costs. We expect charges associated with Mediabrands to be completed during the first half of 2009. Charges related to the creation of Draftfcb in 2006 are complete. The charges were separated from the rest of our operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations because they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business.  

Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges  

During our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2006, our discounted future operating cash flow projections at one of our domestic advertising reporting units indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value, primarily due to client losses. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $27.2 in 2006 in our IAN segment.  

EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Interest Expense  

For 2008 as compared to 2007, cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the repurchase of the majority of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2008, lower interest rates paid on the Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes, lower short-term debt balances and lower interest rates at our international agencies. Interest income decreased due to more conservative investment strategies in the U.S. compared to the prior year and lower interest rates in the U.S. For 2007 as compared to 2006, cash interest expense increased due to higher short-term debt balances, and interest income increased due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates at some of our international agencies.  

Non-cash amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and deferred warrant costs in connection with our 2006 committed credit agreement that expires in June 2009, and as a result, non-cash amortization expense is expected to decrease in 2009. Additionally, non-cash amortization is offset primarily by the amortization of the loss on extinguishment of $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in 2006.

Other Income (Expense)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  Non-cash charges related to the extinguishment of $200.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in 2007 and $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in 2006. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Sale of Businesses and Investments  Primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses, cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities, and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our Rabbi Trusts. Losses in 2007 primarily related to the sale of several businesses within Draftfcb for a loss of $9.3 and charges at Lowe of $7.8 as a result of the realization of cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of several businesses. Gains in 2006 primarily related to a net gain of $20.9 from the sale of an investment located in Asia Pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership interest in an agency within Lowe. We also sold our interest in a German advertising agency and recognized its remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance, which resulted in a non-cash benefit of $17.0.  

Vendor Discount and Credit Adjustments  We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established during the 2004 Restatement. Amounts included in other income (expense) reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed. For additional information see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Litigation Settlement  During May 2008, the SEC concluded its investigation that began in 2002 into our financial reporting practices, resulting in a settlement charge of $12.0.  

Investment Impairments  In 2007 we realized an other-than-temporary charge of $5.8 relating to a $12.5 investment in auction rate securities, representing our total investment in auction rate securities. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

In 2008, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances, the non-deductible SEC settlement provision and additional net tax reserves for uncertain tax positions. Our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2008 by the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against taxable profits and by the net reversal of certain valuation allowances in jurisdictions where entities have demonstrated a sustained period of profitability and future projections indicate that the trend will continue. Additionally, we recognized tax benefits from tax law and other changes in certain U.S. states, which impacted the effective tax rate.  

During 2008, we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of $48.0 relating to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where the available evidence was sufficiently positive for us to believe that it is now more likely than not that the corresponding tax loss carryforward will be utilized. We believe we have appropriately considered the current economic climate in relying on the level of projected taxable income. During 2007 and 2006, we had net reversals in our valuation allowances of $22.3 and $29.6, respectively, on existing deferred tax assets.  

The tax provision for 2007 was primarily impacted by the effective settlement of the IRS examination for 2003 and 2004 which resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits, of which approximately $80.0 was attributable to certain worthless securities deductions. The favorable impact of this item and other net reserve releases are primary reasons for the change in the effective tax rate compared to 2006. The tax provision for 2007 was also impacted by foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances.  

The tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic losses, foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances.  

For additional information see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Segment Results of Operations  

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2008: Integrated Agency Networks (IAN) and Constituency Management Group (CMG). We also report results for the Corporate and other group.  

IAN  

REVENUE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2008 our revenue increased by $365.0, consisting of organic growth of $184.8, led by the technology and telecommunications sector as well as the retail sector. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily a result of higher revenues with existing clients and net client wins, primarily at McCann and Mediabrands.   

29  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 Partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was decreased revenue from Lowe and certain independent agencies that are largely dependent on the automobile sector due to lower revenues with existing clients and net client losses. The international organic revenue increase occurred throughout all regions. McCanns revenue increased due to higher revenue from existing clients in the Continental Europe region and net client wins and higher revenue from existing clients in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China. Lowes revenue increase was primarily due to higher revenue from existing clients and net client wins predominantly in the Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe regions, primarily in Spain and France. Mediabrands contributed to the revenue increase in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Spain. Draftfcbs revenue increased in Latin America due to higher revenues with existing clients primarily in Brazil.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2007 our revenue increased by $275.1, consisting of a favorable foreign currency impact of $170.3 and organic revenue growth of $150.3. The domestic organic revenue increase was a result of higher revenue from existing clients and net client wins, primarily at McCann and Hill Holliday. Partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was decreased revenue from existing clients at Lowe and net client losses at Draftfcb. The international organic revenue increase occurred primarily throughout the United Kingdom and Asia Pacific regions driven by increases in client spending at McCann, partially offset by net client losses at Draftfcb and Lowe across most international regions.  

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income increased during 2008 due to an increase in revenue of $365.0, and decreased office and general expenses of $15.1, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $217.5. The decrease in office and general expenses was due to lower internal expense allocations from corporate, favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 and lower production expenses. The decrease in office and general expenses is partially offset by increased bad debt expense and higher amortization of intangibles primarily related to acquisitions made in 2008. Higher salaries and related expenses were primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $183.1 to support growth in 2008, primarily at McCann and Mediabrands.  

Operating income increased during 2007 due to an increase in revenue of $275.1, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $122.9 and office and general expenses of $15.4. Higher salaries and related expenses were due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $131.2 to support growth, primarily at McCann. Higher office and general expenses were due to increases in shared service expenses which were not allocated in prior years and the increased allocation of technology expenses from Corporate, partially offset by lower occupancy costs, primarily due to lease termination and other exit costs related to facilities exited in 2006.

CMG  

REVENUE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2008 revenue increased by $43.5 due to organic revenue growth of $64.6, led by public relations, which covers a broad range of services and client sectors. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to net client wins and increased spending from existing clients in the public relations business. The international organic revenue increase was primarily from the completion of several projects with existing clients and net client wins in the events marketing business in the United Kingdom. Revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects where we act as principal, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2007 revenue increased by $88.3, due to organic growth of $86.3. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to client wins and expanding business with existing clients in the public relations business, the completion of several projects with existing clients in the events marketing business and expanding business with existing clients in the sports marketing business. The international organic revenue increase in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions was primarily from existing clients in the public relations business. The international revenue increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from existing clients in Europe primarily due to project-based events in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 related to the sports marketing business.  

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income increased during 2008 due to an increase in revenue of $43.5 and decreased office and general expenses of $9.1, partially offset by increased salaries and related expenses of $23.9. Office and general expenses decreased primarily due to lower occupancy costs, as a result of lease termination and other exit costs related to facilities exited in 2007 and due to favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 when compared to 2007, partially offset by higher production expenses related to several projects with new and existing clients in the events marketing business. Salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an   

31  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $17.8 related to the events marketing and public relations businesses to support revenue growth.  

Operating income increased during 2007 due to an increase in revenue of $88.3, partially offset by increases in office and general expenses of $46.1 and salaries and related expenses of $35.9. Salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $28.4 to support revenue growth. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses of $32.0 related to the completion of several projects in the events marketing business and higher occupancy costs, primarily due to lease termination charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization related to certain leasehold improvements in facilities exited in 2007.  

CORPORATE AND OTHER  

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, bonus, and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits, legal, information technology and other consulting services, which are engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition, office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of these expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. Allocation methodologies are consistent with prior years.  

Corporate and other expenses decreased during 2008 by $45.3 to $170.6. This was primarily due to lower professional fees, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items when compared to 2007. Lower professional fees were primarily due to improvements in our financial systems, back office processes and internal controls as well as reduced legal consultations associated with the resolution of our SEC investigation and other financial matters. In addition, base salaries, benefits and temporary help decreased due to lower headcount and reduced technology projects. As a result, we had lower internal expenses allocated to our operating divisions.  

Corporate and other expenses decreased during 2007 by $59.4 to $215.9. This was primarily driven by improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes and internal controls, which resulted in a reduction in professional fees. Partially offsetting this reduction were higher salaries and related expenses, primarily related to long-term incentive award accruals for a one-time performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the Company and the transfer of resources into a global finance organization as part of a regional monitoring program. In addition, amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the charging of shared services expenses that were not previously allocated as well as for costs relating to the consolidation of certain global processes into our shared service center.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW  

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $237.5 during 2008, even after the repurchase of approximately $191.0 of our 4.50% Notes during March. A component of this change was an increase in marketable securities of $145.2, primarily due to the purchase of a time deposit with a maturity greater than ninety days.  

Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating activities of $865.3 for 2008 reflects a significant improvement over 2007 and 2006. The improvement from 2007 to 2008 was driven by improvements in working capital of $364.5 and increased net income of $127.4.  

Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income of $295.0, working capital cash generation of $193.5 and net non-cash expense items of $403.0. Net non-cash expense items primarily include depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, restricted stock awards, non-cash compensation, and bond discounts and deferred financing costs.  

Cash from changes in working capital reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In 2008 we generated cash from working capital of $193.5 compared to a use of $171.0 in 2007 and $250.6 in 2006. This improvement is primarily due to growth in our businesses and improved working capital management at certain of our operating units.  

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production costs and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers.  

33  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.  

Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing activities during 2008 includes net purchases of short-term marketable securities and payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Net purchases of short-term marketable securities of $154.3 primarily relates to a time deposit with a maturity greater than ninety days. Capital expenditures of $138.4 relate to costs associated with leasehold improvements, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures. Payments for acquisitions of $106.0, primarily relate to new acquisitions and to a lesser extent deferred payments on prior acquisitions.  

Financing Activities  

In March 2008, holders of approximately $191.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% Notes due 2023 exercised their put option that required us to repurchase their 4.50% Notes. Payment for the purchased 4.50% Notes was made with available cash. In addition, cash used in financing activities during 2008 reflects dividend payments of $27.6 on our Series B Preferred Stock and decreases in short-term bank borrowings related to our international uncommitted credit facilities.  

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  

We generated significant cash from operations in 2008 and ended the year with $2,274.9 in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Based on our cash flow forecasts we expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. In addition, we have back-up credit facilities available to support our operating needs. Our policy is to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity, which we believe is appropriate for our Company in view of the current conditions in the economy and financial markets. In 2008, our lowest month-end total cash and marketable securities balance was $1,512.3 on March 31st, and our highest month-end total cash and marketable securities balance was $2,274.9 on December 31st. In 2007, the lowest month-end total cash and marketable securities balance was $1,440.0 on July 31st, and the highest month-end total cash and marketable securities balance was $2,037.4 on December 31st.  

Economic and financial conditions deteriorated sharply in the latter part of 2008 and the current economic conditions are expected to persist throughout 2009. Current market conditions may affect the financial condition of some of our clients which can cause a decrease in demand for advertising and marketing services. A decrease in revenue, should it occur, could pose a challenge to our level of cash generation from operations. Furthermore, we have accounts receivable related to revenues earned and for pass-through costs incurred on behalf of our clients as well as expenditures billable to clients related to costs incurred and fees earned that have not yet been billed. Although we have not experienced a material increase in client defaults, and as of December 31, 2008 our largest client, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 4% of our accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, current market conditions increase the likelihood that we could experience future losses.  

We maintain committed credit facilities to increase our financial flexibility. We have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003, although we use them to obtain letters of credit to support commitments on behalf of certain clients. As discussed below under   Financing and Sources of Funds  Credit Facilities, in July 2008 we entered into a $335.0 three-year credit agreement (the 2008 Credit Agreement). This credit facility includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions. If any of the financial institutions in the syndicate were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institutions commitment, the total size of the   

34  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 facility would be reduced by the size of that institutions commitment. We also have a $750.0 three-year credit agreement (the 2006 Credit Agreement) that matures in June 2009. We replaced a portion of this facility in July of 2008 with our 2008 Credit Agreement. We do not currently plan on replacing the full amount of the 2006 Credit Agreement.  

If, however, our business is significantly impacted by further deterioration in the economic environment or otherwise, it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs or enhance our financial flexibility. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the capital markets, such as the amount of available credit. Currently, for a non-investment grade company such as ours, the capital markets are challenging, with limited available financing at higher costs than in recent years. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  

Funding Requirements  

Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, payments related to vendor discounts and credits, debt service, preferred stock dividends, contributions to pension and postretirement plans, and taxes. In any twelve month period, we maintain substantial flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures and cash used for new acquisitions.  

       Acquisitions  We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and to increase our ownership interests in current investments, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings and to expand our presence in high-growth markets.  

       Payments related to vendor discounts and credits  Of the liabilities recognized as part of the 2004 Restatement, we estimate that we will pay approximately $20.0 primarily related to vendor discounts and credits over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2008 our liability balance for these payments was $126.0.  

       Debt service  Our $250.0 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes mature on November 15, 2009. The remainder of our debt is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled from 2010 to 2023. See table below for the maturity schedule of our long-term debt.  

       Preferred stock dividends  We pay regular quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock of $6.9, or $27.6 annually.  

       Contributions to pension and postretirement plans  Our funding policy regarding our pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we made contributions of $28.3 to our foreign pension plans and $2.3 to our domestic pension plans. For 2009, we expect to contribute $19.3 to our foreign pension plans and $10.0 to our domestic pension plans.

The following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008, and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  1  Amounts represent maturity at par. Holders of our 4.25% Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at par in March 2012 and holders of our 4.75% and 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes for cash, stock or a combination, at our election, at par in March 2013. All of these Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.  

  2  Non-cancelable operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements.  

  3  We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the potential risk associated with negative future performance of the acquired entity. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS  

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level, and to a lesser extent at our largest subsidiaries. Below is a summary of sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2008:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  1  We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support our commitments, or those of our subsidiaries, to purchase media placements, mostly in locations outside the U.S., or to satisfy other obligations. These letters of credit have historically not been drawn upon.  

Debt Transactions  

In March 2008, holders required us to repurchase approximately $191.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Notes. We funded the repurchase from available cash. This reduced the outstanding amount of the 4.50% Notes to $8.7. The 4.50% Notes were initially issued in March 2003 in an aggregate principal amount of $800.0, but in November 2006 we exchanged $400.0 of 4.50% Notes for the same aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, and in November 2007 we exchanged a further $200.0 for the same aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

In June 2008 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to $125.0 in notional amount of our 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 (the 7.25% Notes), which we subsequently terminated in September 2008. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Credit Facilities  

In July 2008 we entered into the 2008 Credit Agreement. The 2008 Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the 2008 Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $335.0 or the equivalent in other currencies, and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a limit on letters of credit of $200.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the 2008 Credit Agreement are unsecured. The terms of the 2008 Credit Agreement allow us to increase the aggregate lending commitment to a maximum amount of $485.0 if lenders agree to the additional commitments. In addition, the 2008 Credit Agreement includes covenants that, among other things, (i) limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries, (ii) restrict our payments for cash capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock dividends, share repurchases and certain other purposes, and (iii) limit subsidiary debt.  

The 2008 Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain, on a consolidated basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter, (i) an interest coverage ratio, (ii) a leverage ratio, and (iii) minimum EBITDA for the four quarters then ended. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as seen in the table below.

If we believed we would not be able to comply with these financial covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment and/or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. If we do not comply with these financial covenants and are unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the 2008 Credit Agreement could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit with one of our lenders funds in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2008 there was no outstanding principal or letters of credit. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In June 2006 we entered into the 2006 Credit Agreement, which we can utilize for cash advances and for letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750.0 outstanding at any time. The 2006 Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the 2006 Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $750.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. The aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed $600.0 at any time. Our obligations under the 2006 Credit Agreement are unsecured, and we are not subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants under this facility. This facility expires in June of 2009. We have not drawn

 on it, and we plan to use the 2008 Credit Agreement to replace the letters of credit currently outstanding under the 2006 Credit Agreement. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

We also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the U.S., and the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $78.8 and $95.9, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately 3% and 5%, respectively.  

Cash Pooling  

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the U.S., we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007 the amounts netted were $858.7 and $1,295.7, respectively.  

Debt Ratings  

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 13, 2009 were as follows:

The most recent change in our credit ratings occurred on July 9, 2008 when Moodys Investors Service upgraded our outlook from stable to positive. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
