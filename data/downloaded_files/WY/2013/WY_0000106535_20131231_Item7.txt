MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)

WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS MD&A 

Our MD&A includes the following major sections:

•economic and market conditions affecting our operations;

•financial performance summary;

•results of our operations — consolidated and by segment;

•liquidity and capital resources — where we discuss our cash flows;

•off-balance sheet arrangements;

•environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and

•accounting matters — where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS

In 2013, the U.S. economy continued to advance at a sluggish pace. Growth in the U.S. economy was hindered by fiscal issues which included the fiscal cliff, sequestration and a budget impasse which caused a partial shutdown of the government for 16 days. Private sector growth was an area of comparative strength, but not without incident, as hints of tapering of the Federal Reserve asset purchases caused an abrupt rise in interest rates which rattled markets. These factors significantly affected the economy, limiting anticipated improvements in key economic indicators. The U.S. housing market, while affected by these factors, continued to show signs of improvement in 2013 as lower inventories of new and existing homes led to increases in new home construction and rises in home values. The strength of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberlands segments.

Real Estate focuses on building single-family homes. As published by the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. housing starts for 2013 were 923 thousand units, with single family units accounting for 618 thousand of the total. This represents a 15 percent increase in single family starts from 2012, which was 535 thousand units. Multifamily construction also increased in 2013 to 305 thousand units compared with 246 thousand in 2012. While a significant improvement, current housing demand remains well below 1 million or more single family starts, the typical level during the 15-year period of 1992-2007. In 2013, new home sales in the U.S. averaged 430 thousand units. This level represents a 17 percent increase over 2012.

Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for wood products has continued to improve as housing starts have increased. This has resulted in higher prices than those observed in 2012. Prices for most commodity wood products were higher in 2013, with the greatest increases observed in Douglas fir lumber and oriented strand board (OSB). Higher prices led to improved industry operating rates for lumber and OSB. Despite the improvement, demand for both lumber and panels remain below peak levels.

Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand. In the South, several years of deferred harvest due to weak demand have created increased inventories and as a result southern pine log prices were modestly higher in 2013 while western log prices, helped by resurgent demand from China and Japan, increased more substantially in 2013.

Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar was relatively stable compared to most global currencies during 2013 with some notable exceptions. The volatility which characterized the Euro in 2012 was mostly absent in 2013. The U.S. dollar weakened slightly against the euro for much of 2013, which improved our pulp mills competitiveness against competitors with euro denominated costs and had a positive effect on Cellulose Fibers pricing. Demand in the key global economies of Europe and China improved from 2012.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

HOW WE DID IN 2013

Summary of Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2013 WITH 2012

Net Sales

Net sales increased $1,470 million — 21 percent — primarily due to the following:

• Wood Products segment sales increased $951 million, primarily due to higher sales realizations and higher sales volumes across all major product lines.

•Timberlands segment sales increased $266 million, primarily due to higher export and domestic log prices, increased sales volumes and the purchase of Longview Timber.

• Real Estate segment sales increased $205 million, primarily due to increased home closings and improved average prices for homes closed.

•Cellulose Fibers segment sales increased $48 million primarily due to increased sales volumes.

Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased $155 million — 40 percent — primarily due to the following:

• a $537 million increase in gross margin in our Wood Products, Timberlands and Real Estate segments. Our Wood Products and Timberlands segment increases were primarily due to higher sales realizations and sales volumes. Increased gross margin in our Real Estate segment was primarily due to increased single-family home closings and improved average prices for homes closed.

•a $184 million change in income taxes from an expense in 2012 to a benefit in 2013 primarily related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit recorded in 2013.

These increases in our earnings were partially offset by:

•a $358 million increase in charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairments primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge relating to a large master-planned community in our Real Estate segment;

•a $155 million decrease in other operating income, primarily due to a $103 million pretax gain recognized in 2012 related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment; and

•a $45 million increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net Sales

Net sales increased $843 million — 14 percent — primarily due to the following:

• Wood Products segment sales increased $782 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes across all major product lines and improved selling prices for structural lumber, OSB and plywood.

• Real Estate segment sales increased $232 million, primarily due to the sale of a 3,200 acre master planned community in Houston, Texas, sale of commercial acreage and multi-family lots in southern California and increased home closings.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $204 million in Cellulose Fibers segment sales, primarily due to lower pulp price realizations.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 37
Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased $54 million — 16 percent — primarily due to the following:

• a $103 million pretax gain recognized in 2012 related to a postretirement plan amendment;

• charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments decreased $51 million; and

• a $48 million increase in gross margin from our Real Estate segment, primarily due to increased contributions from land and lot sales.

These increases in our earnings were partially offset by:

•a $240 million decrease in gross margin from our Cellulose Fibers segment, primarily due to lower pulp price realizations;

•a pretax gain of $152 million on the sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2011; and

•a $117 million increase in income taxes due to higher income in our TRS in 2012 compared to 2011, and lower tax benefits primarily due to foreign tax credits recognized in 2011.

TIMBERLANDS

HOW WE DID IN 2013

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Timberlands.

Here is a comparison of net sales to unaffiliated customers, intersegment sales, and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Timberlands 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On July 23, 2013, we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in Longview Timber LLC (Longview Timber) for cash and assumed debt. The sales and net contribution to earnings of our acquired entity from the acquisition date to the end of the year are included in the West results of our Timberlands segment. Longview Timber was and continues to be a supplier to our Wood Products segment and those sales are shown in intersegment sales. More information on this transaction can be found in Note 3: Longview Timber Purchase in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 38
COMPARING 2013 WITH 2012

Net Sales — Unaffiliated Customers

Net sales to unaffiliated customers increased $266 million — 25 percent — primarily from the following:

•Western log sales increased $269 million due to higher export and domestic log prices and a 31 percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased export and domestic demand and the purchase of Longview Timber; and

•Southern log sales increased $23 million due to higher log prices and a 6 percent increase in sales volume as the result of increased thinning activity.

These increases were partially offset by:

•a $16 million decrease in sales from our International operations primarily due to a shift toward internal sales of manufactured products; and 

•a $9 million decrease in chip sales.

Intersegment Sales

Intersegment sales increased $116 million — 17 percent — primarily due to the following:

•a $71 million increase, primarily due to higher log prices and increased volume in our legacy Western timberlands and the South and the purchase of Longview Timber; and

•a $45 million increase due to higher log prices in Canada.

Net contribution to earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $148 million — 46 percent — primarily from:

•a $104 million increase due to higher sales volumes and demand for export and domestic logs in our legacy Western timberlands. Harvest levels increased 5 percent in our legacy Western timberlands;

•a $49 million increase due to higher log prices in our legacy Western timberlands and the South; and

•a $36 million increase due to the purchase of Longview Timber.

These increases were partially offset by:

•a $30 million increase in operating costs in our legacy Western timberlands primarily due to a higher mix of higher cost logs from internal and outside purchases and increased silviculture costs; and

•$14 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs, excluding Longview Timber.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net Sales — Unaffiliated Customers

Net sales to unaffiliated customers increased $33 million — 3 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Southern log sales increased $37 million due to increased sales volumes of 14 percent and increased price realizations of 4 percent, as a result of increased harvest levels in response to increased third party demand.

•Sales from our international operations increased $20 million, primarily due to increased plywood prices of 16 percent and a 33 percent increase in plywood sales volumes.

•Western log sales increased by $14 million due to increased sales volumes of 12 percent, partially offset by lower export and domestic log prices.

The above items were partially offset by:

•a $22 million decrease in minerals, oil and gas revenue primarily due to lower natural gas prices; and

•a $21 million decrease in timberland exchanges.

Intersegment Sales

Intersegment sales increased $37 million — 6 percent — primarily from the following:

•a $22 million decrease in mineral income, primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices;

•a $15 million decrease due to fewer timberland exchanges and higher and better-use land sales; and

•a $12 million increase in operating costs in the West, primarily due to increased logging and maintenance costs.

The above items were partially offset by:

•a $46 million increase, primarily due to higher sales volumes and demand for domestic and export logs and an increase in harvest levels of 9 percent in the West and 18 percent in the South;

•a $10 million increase in earnings from our international operations, primarily due to higher plywood prices and sales volumes; and

•a $7 million increase due to higher log prices in the South.

•a $27 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

During 2011, we recognized $29 million of impairment charges in the Wood Products segment primarily related to the decision to permanently close four engineered lumber facilities that had been previously indefinitely closed. These facilities are located in Albany, Oregon; Dodson, Louisiana; Pine Hill, Alabama; and Simsboro, Louisiana. Total restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges in 2011 for the segment were $64 million and 2012 were not significant.

CELLULOSE FIBERS

HOW WE DID IN 2013 

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Cellulose Fibers business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Cellulose Fibers.

Here is a comparison of net sales and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Cellulose Fibers

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2013 WITH 2012 

Net Sales

Net sales increased $48 million — 3 percent — primarily due to:

•Increased sales volumes of 6 percent for pulp, resulting from increased demand, which was partially offset by decreased pulp sales realizations of $9 per ton — 1 percent.

•Liquid packaging board sales realizations decreased $82 per ton — 7 percent — resulting primarily from mix of products.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $23 million — 10 percent — primarily due to:

•a $25 million decrease in liquid packaging sales realizations; and

•a $17 million decrease in pulp sales realizations;

These decreases were partially offset by a $16 million decrease in chemical and energy costs.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011 

Net Sales

Net sales decreased $204 million — 10 percent — primarily due to:

•Pulp sales realizations decreased $108 per ton — 12 percent — resulting from weak global economies and a weak euro. The effect of the price decrease was partially offset by an improved sales mix to higher valued products.

•Sales volumes for liquid packaging board decreased 8,000 tons — 3 percent — as the result of weaker demand in Japan.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $229 million — 51 percent — primarily due to:

•a $190 million decrease due to lower pulp sales realizations, partially offset by an improved sales mix to higher value products; and

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 41
REAL ESTATE

HOW WE DID IN 2013

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate.

Here is a comparison of net sales and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Real Estate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On June 16, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives with respect to Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO), our homebuilding and real estate development business. The Board indicated that it intended to consider a broad range of alternatives including, but not limited to, continuing to operate WRECO, or a merger, sale or spin-off of the business. On November 4, 2013, we announced that we had entered into a transaction agreement dated as of November 3, 2013 with TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. (TRI Pointe). Pursuant to the transaction agreement, WRECO will be divested through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction and ultimately become a wholly owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe. More information on this transaction can be found in Note 4: WRECO Divestiture in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2013.

COMPARING 2013 WITH 2012

Net Sales

Net sales increased $205 million — 19 percent — primarily due to an increase of $349 million in revenue from single-family home sales. Home closings increased 27 percent from 2,314 in 2012 to 2,939 in 2013. The average price of homes closed increased 10 percent from $376,000 in 2012 to $415,000 in 2013. On a same store basis, prices have increased across all markets. Our margins have remained steady across all markets.

This was partially offset by a decrease of $141 million in revenue from land and lot sales. 2012 included the sale of a 3,200-acre master planned community in Houston, Texas. The 2013 land and lot sales were primarily residential lot sales and an acreage sale related to a school site.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $336 million, primarily due to:

•a $351 million increase in charges for impairments and restructuring including a $343 million impairment of Coyote Springs and $6 million restructuring costs related to Real Estate divestiture in 2013; and

•a $60 million decrease in contributions to earnings from land and lot sales.

These decreases were partially offset by a $73 million increase in contribution for single-family operations due to higher volume and higher average sales prices of homes closed. Single-family gross margins improved to 22.0 percent in 2013 compared to 20.3 percent in 2012, reflecting changes in mix.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net Sales

Net sales increased $232 million — 28 percent — primarily due to:

•Single-family housing revenues increased $102 million. Home closings increased 21 percent to 2,314 in 2012 from 1,912 in 2011. The average price of homes closed declined 6 percent to $376,000 in 2012 from $402,000 in 2011.

•Revenues from land and lot sales increased $126 million. 2012 included the sale of a 3,200 acre master planned community in Houston, Texas and the sale of commercial acreage and multi-family lots in southern California.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $47 million — 81 percent — primarily due to:

•a $54 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales; and

•an $8 million decrease in charges for impairments and restructuring.

These improvements were partially offset by the following:

•a $7 million increase in selling expenses, primarily due to volume related increases in sales and marketing costs; and

•a $7 million decrease in income from loss reserves for adjustments for settled matters.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 42
Net contribution from single-family housing was comparable year-over-year. Improvements from the higher volume of closings was offset by the decrease in the average price of homes closed and lower single-family gross margins. Average single-family gross margins were 20.7 percent in 2012 compared to 23.3 percent in 2011.

UNALLOCATED ITEMS

Unallocated Items are gains or charges not related to or allocated to an individual operating segment. They include a portion of items such as: share-based compensation, pension and postretirement costs, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses associated with financing, and the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and the LIFO reserve.

Net Contribution to Earnings for Unallocated Items

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest income and other Unallocated Items in 2013 included a $10 million pretax gain for the sale of part of our investment in Liaison Technologies Inc. See Note 9: Equity Affiliates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Other Unallocated Items in 2012 included a gain of $103 million related to a postretirement plan amendment. See Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Our net interest expense incurred for the last three years was:

•$371 million in 2013,

•$348 million in 2012 and

In connection with repayments, included in our net interest expense, we recognized the following pretax losses on early extinguishment of debt:

•$25 million in 2013 and

•$26 million in 2011.

Interest expense in 2013 includes $11 million in fees related to a bridge loan we did not use in the acquisition of Longview Timber that was expensed. Excluding this item and loss on early extinguishment of debt, interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rate on remaining debt.

INCOME TAXES

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years was:

•$(129) million in 2013,

•$55 million in 2012 and

•a $10 million tax benefit due to the early extinguishment of debt.

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate level tax on income of the REIT that is distributed to shareholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRS, which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and the portion of our timberlands segment income included in the TRS.

The table below summarizes the historical tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31:

•$291 million in 2011.

COMPARING 2013 WITH 2012

Net cash provided by operations increased $423 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, primarily due to a $1,476 million increase in cash received from customers partially offset by a $1,031 million increase in cash paid to employees, suppliers and others as sales and production increased in our Wood Products, Timberlands and Real Estate segments. Receivables, primarily in our Wood Products segment, increased significantly in 2013 compared to 2012 as sales increased.

COMPARING 2012 WITH 2011

Net cash provided by operations increased $290 million in 2012 as compared with 2011:

•Cash we received from customers in our Wood Products and Real Estate segments increased $931 million, primarily due to increased sales and cash received of $120 million for land and lot sales. 

•Cash paid for interest decreased $69 million, primarily due to the early retirement of $518 million of debt in 2011. We paid interest of $351 million in 2012 compared to $420 million in 2011.

•Net cash inflows related to income taxes increased $41 million. We received income tax refunds of $13 million in 2012 and paid $28 million in 2011.

Partially offsetting these increases were:

•Cash paid to employees, suppliers and others increased $638 million in our Wood Products and Real Estate segments due to increased production.

The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were $494 million. We also entered into a $550 million 7-year senior unsecured term loan credit facility maturing in September 2020 and borrowed $550 million. Borrowings are at LIBOR plus a spread or at other interest rates mutually agreed upon between the borrower and the lending banks.

On October 15, 2013, we repaid the $1,118 million carrying value of the debt that we assumed in the acquisition of Longview Timber and related fees, expenses and premiums using the proceeds from the notes issued and the borrowings from our term loan credit facility borrowed in 2013. A pretax charge of $25 million was included in our net interest expense in 2013, for early retirement premiums and other miscellaneous charges in connection with the early extinguishment of debt.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:

•historical experience and

•assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:

•pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•potential impairments of long-lived assets; and

•legal, environmental and product liability reserves.

Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:

•expected long-term rate of return,

•discount rates,

•anticipated trends in health care costs,

•assumed increases in salaries and

•mortality rates.

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:

•actual pension fund performance,

•level of lump sum distributions,

•plan changes,

•changes in plan participation or coverage and

•portfolio changes and restructuring.

This section provides more information about our:

•expected long-term rate of return and

•discount rates.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return 

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. 

Over the 29 years it has been in place, our U.S. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 14.8 percent net compound annual return rate.

After considering available information at the end of 2013, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.0 percent. Factors we considered include:

•the net compounded annual return of 10.0 percent achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy the past 10 years and

•current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 49
Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$22 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.

Discount Rates 

Our discount rates as of December 31, 2013, are:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2014 will be based on the 4.9 percent and 4.0 percent assumed discount rates for U.S. plans and 4.7 percent and 4.6 percent assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.

Our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$21 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our financial statements.

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets.

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:

•future cash flows,

•residual values and

•fair values of the assets.

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:

•probability of alternative outcomes,

•product pricing,

•raw material costs,

•product sales and

•discount rate.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: REAL ESTATE

We review homebuilding long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. 

Real Estate In Process of Development and Land Being Processed for Development

Real estate in process of development and land being processed for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities (MPCs). MPCs typically include several product segments such as residential, active adult, retail and commercial. We evaluate impairment at the subdivision or MPC product segment level. Factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or MPC product segment for impairment include:

•gross margins and selling costs on homes closed in recent months;

•projected gross margins and selling costs based on our operating budgets;

•competitor pricing and incentives in the same or nearby communities; and

•trends in average selling prices, discounts, incentives, sales velocity and cancellations.

We update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and MPC product segment that may be impaired. The undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by community-specific factors that include:

•estimates and timing of future revenues;

•estimates and timing of future land development, materials, labor and contractor costs;

•community location and desirability, including availability of schools, retail, mass transit and other services;

•local economic and demographic trends regarding employment, new jobs and taxes;

•competitor presence, product types, future competition, pricing, incentives and discounts; and

•land availability, number of lots we own or control, entitlement restrictions and alternative uses.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 50
The carrying amount of each subdivision and MPC product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or MPC product segment. An impairment charge for a subdivision or MPC product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot.

Real Estate for Sale

Real estate for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell. We regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans.

The carrying amount of real estate for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount. The fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions, demographic factors and competitor actions, and is inherently uncertain. Actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates. The carrying amount of real estate for sale is evaluated quarterly.

Market Approach

We use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate assets when information for comparable assets is available. This approach is commonly used for completed inventory and individual assets for sale. We typically use:

•sales prices for comparable assets,

•market studies,

•appraisals or

•legitimate offers.

Income Approach

We generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects and assets in process of development. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

We record contingent liabilities when:

•it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and

•the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:

•historical experience,

•judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and

•recommendations of legal counsel.

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.

While we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. See Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Currently there are no significant prospective accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on us.
