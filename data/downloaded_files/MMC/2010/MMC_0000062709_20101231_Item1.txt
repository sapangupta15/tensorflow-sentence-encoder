REGULATION  

The Companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under United States federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. See Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses.  

Risk and Insurance Services. While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers, managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license from a governmental agency or self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in this case, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are only permitted following an extensive review process.

Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive. This Directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance. The adoption by member states of the European Union of regulations to comply with the Directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union to become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the United Kingdom.  

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which the Companys subsidiaries do business, including the FSA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.  

Certain of the Companys Risk and Insurance Services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., a broker-dealer and investment adviser, registered in the U.S. with the SEC, and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), primarily in connection with investment banking-related services relating to insurance-linked and alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of NIA Securities, LLC, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. Guy Carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the European Union through MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FSA. Marsh also receives investment management services in the European Union from Marsh Investment Service Limited, which is also regulated by the FSA. MMC Securities Corp., MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, NIA Securities, LLC, and Marsh Investment Service Limited are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marsh & McLennan Companies.  

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker customarily looks to the client for payment.  

Consulting. Certain of Mercers retirement-related consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the SEC in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to persons, institutions and other entities on the investment of pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. Mercer uses the services of MMC Securities Corp. with the provision of certain retirement and employee benefit services. Oliver Wyman Group use the services of MMC Securities Corp. (in the United States) and MMC Securities (Europe) Limited (in the European Union), primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services.  

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS  

The Company faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services, including competition with regard to identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates. The Company also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see Risks Relating to the Company Generally Competitive Risks, in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  

Risk and Insurance Services. The Companys combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance  

9  

Table of Contents 

 businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. The Company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market, distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products.   

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. Certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers. There are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.  

The continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect Marshs competitive position. These proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report. Please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) below.  

Consulting. The Companys consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.  

Mercers investment consulting and investment management businesses face competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions.  

In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group internally, without assistance from outside advisors.  

Segmentation of Activity by Type of Service and Geographic Area of Operation.  

Financial information relating to the types of services provided by the Company and the geographic areas of its operations is incorporated herein by reference to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
