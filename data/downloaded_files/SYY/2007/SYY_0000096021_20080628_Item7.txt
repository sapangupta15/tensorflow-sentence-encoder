Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

 Highlights  

 Sales increased 7.1% in fiscal 2008 over the prior year. Product costs increased an estimated 6.0% during fiscal 2008 over the prior year. Operating income increased to $1,879,949,000 and 5.0% of sales, a 10.0% increase over the prior year. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share increased 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively, over the prior year.  

 Fiscal 2008 provided a challenging economic environment. Our industry is experiencing various macro-economic pressures, including high fuel costs, rising food prices and general economic conditions which are pressuring consumer disposable income. These factors restricted growth in fiscal 2008 and are continuing into fiscal 2009. High food cost inflation, which we began to experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, prevailed throughout fiscal 2008. In spite of these conditions, our operating companies managed margins and expenses effectively. Gross profit dollars increased 6.5% in fiscal 2008, while operating expenses grew only 5.3% over the prior year.  

 Operating income was negatively impacted by additional expenses from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values as compared to gains in fiscal 2007 and increased provisions related to multi-employer pension plans. The negative impact of these additional expenses was partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower company-sponsored pension expenses. In addition, fuel costs increased in fiscal 2008, driven by higher fuel prices. We partially offset the impact of the higher fuel costs through fuel usage reduction measures as well as fuel surcharges. We expect fuel costs in fiscal 2009 to be greater than in fiscal 2008.  

 Overview  

 SYSCO distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce companies, custom-cut meat operations, hotel supply operations, SYGMA (our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary) and a company that distributes to international customers.  

 We estimate that we serve about 16% of an approximately $231 billion annual market. This market includes i) the foodservice market in the United States and Canada and ii) the hotel amenity and hotel furniture and textile market in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-prepared-away-from-home, market represents approximately one-half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to about 50% in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time.  

 Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 1.3% in calendar year 2007 and 1.9% in calendar year 2006.  

 General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-prepared-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income, are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market. Historically, we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry. We intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, margin management, productivity gains and supply chain management.  

 Strategic Business Initiatives  

 SYSCO maintains strategic focus areas which aim to help us achieve our long-term vision of becoming the global leader of the efficient, multi-temperature food product value chain. The following areas generally comprise the initiatives that are currently serving as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a sustainable future.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 A major component of our National Supply Chain is the use of redistribution centers (RDCs). The first RDC, the Northeast RDC located in Front Royal, Virginia, opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Construction of our second RDC in Alachua, Florida was completed in fiscal 2008, and  

 12  
 operations to service our five broadline operating companies in Florida began in April 2008. In fiscal 2009, we intend to service additional broadline companies from our existing RDCs.  

 We will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy, handle and market products for our customers. Our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in North America, however we will also continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities and stay abreast of international acquisition opportunities.  

 As a part of our on going strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses.  

 Accounting Changes  

 FIN 48 Adoption  

 As of July 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the application of SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. As a result of this adoption, we recognized, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, a $91,635,000 decrease in our beginning retained earnings on our July 1, 2007 balance sheet.  

 Pension Measurement Date Change and SFAS 158 Adoption  

 As of June 30, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The recognition provision requires an employer to recognize a plans funded status in its statement of financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement benefit plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 was a decrease in prepaid pension cost of $83,846,000, a decrease in other assets of $43,854,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $10,967,000, a decrease in long-term deferred taxes of $73,328,000, an increase in other long-term liabilities of $52,289,000, and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $117,628,000. The adoption of SFAS 158s recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2006. The adoption has no effect on our consolidated results of operations for any period presented, and it will not affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods.  

 SFAS 158 also has a measurement date provision, which is a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we changed the measurement date for company-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year-end to May 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated SEC filing dates. As a result of this change, we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. With the issuance of SFAS 158, we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time. As a result, beginning with fiscal 2008, the measurement date again corresponded with our fiscal year-end. We performed measurements as of May 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 of our plan assets and benefit obligations. We recorded a charge to beginning retained earnings on July 1, 2007 of $3,572,000, net of tax, for the impact of the cumulative difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates. We also recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on July 1, 2007 of $22,780,000, net of tax, for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet recognition provision between the two measurement dates.  

 EITF 04-13 Adoption  

 In the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted accounting pronouncement EITF 04-13 Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, (EITF 04-13). The accounting standard requires certain transactions, where inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer (as defined), to be presented in the income statement on a net basis. This situation primarily arises for SYSCO when a customer has a proprietary item which they have either manufactured or sourced, but they require our distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to their locations. The application of this standard requires sales and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the application of this standard. We adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and have applied it to similar transactions prospectively. Prior period sales and cost of sales have not been restated. Therefore, the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins, operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the non-comparable periods is affected. The impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced by $99,803,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, and $253,724,000 for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007, without a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, sales are reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable prior year period.  

 13  
 SFAS 123(R) Adoption  

 In fiscal 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)) utilizing the modified-prospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated. Our consolidated results of operations for all periods presented include share-based compensation cost recorded in accordance with SFAS 123(R).  

 Results of Operations  

 The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated:

 Sales  

 Sales for fiscal 2008 were 7.1% greater than fiscal 2007. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008.  

 Sales for fiscal 2007 were 7.4% greater than fiscal 2006. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.7% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. The impact of EITF 04-13 reduced sales growth by 0.7%, or $334,002,000 for fiscal 2007, compared to a $99,803,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which is the one-year anniversary of the adoption of EITF 04-13.  

 Product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices was a significant contributor to sales growth in fiscal 2008 and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2007. Estimated product cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were approximately 6.0% during fiscal 2008, as compared to 3.4% during fiscal 2007.  

 The rate of sales growth declined throughout fiscal 2008 from 8.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to 5.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe the current general economic conditions, which are placing pressure on consumer disposable income, are contributing to a decline in real volume growth in the foodservice market and in turn, have contributed to a slow-down in our sales growth. To the extent that these conditions persist, we believe that sales growth in fiscal 2009 will be lower than what was achieved in fiscal 2008.  

 We believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities, investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthen customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers.  

 Operating Income  

 Cost of sales primarily includes product costs, net of vendor consideration, as well as in-bound freight. Operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities.  

 Operating income increased 10.0% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007, increasing to 5.0% of sales. Gross margin dollars increased 6.5% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, and operating expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal 2008. Operating income increased 14.3% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006, increasing to 4.9% of sales. Gross margin dollars increased 7.4% in fiscal 2007, and operating expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal 2007.  

 Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, SYSCO began experiencing product cost increases in numerous product categories. These increases have persisted throughout fiscal 2008 at levels approximating 6.0%. Generally, SYSCO attempts to pass increased costs to its customers; however, because of contractual and competitive reasons, we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately. SYSCOs goal is to obtain the lowest total procurement cost for our customers. We believe that we have managed the inflationary environment well, as evidenced by gross margin dollars increasing in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 at rates greater than expense increases. The high rate of product cost inflation has continued into fiscal 2009. We believe that prolonged periods of high inflation, such as the current rate, have a negative impact on our customers as rising food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-prepared-away-from home market. As a result, these factors may negatively impact our sales, gross margins and earnings.  

 Fiscal 2008 operating expenses were negatively impacted by a net $24,135,000 in additional expenses as compared to fiscal 2007 from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to multi-employer pension plans, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower company-sponsored pension expenses. In addition, fuel costs increased during fiscal 2008. We increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a portion of these increased costs, thereby partially reducing the impact to operating income.  

 In fiscal 2007, the positive impact on operating expenses from decreases in company-sponsored pension expenses, share-based compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, was largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives.  

 The carrying value of our corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to their cash surrender values. This resulted in a loss of $8,718,000 in fiscal 2008, a gain of $23,922,000 in fiscal 2007 and a gain of $9,702,000 in fiscal 2006.  

 In fiscal 2008, we recorded a provision of $22,284,000 related to additional amounts that we expect to be required to contribute to an underfunded multi-employer pension plan and our withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. In fiscal 2007, we recorded a provision of $4,700,000 related to our withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. See additional discussion of multi-employer pension plans at Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Considerations.  

 Share-based compensation cost in fiscal 2008 was $17,335,000 less than fiscal 2007. Share-based compensation expense decreased $28,852,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. These decreases were primarily due to lower levels of stock option grants in recent years as compared to previous years.  

 Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2008 were $8,754,000 less than fiscal 2007, due primarily to the funding status and the projected asset performance of the qualified pension plan. Net company-sponsored pension costs decreased $56,001,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year, due primarily to the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal 2007 pension costs.  

 15  
 Also affecting the comparison of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives. Due primarily to improved operating results, the non-stock portion of management incentive bonus accruals increased $64,770,000 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 when our performance did not satisfy the criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers. Investments in strategic business initiatives increased $22,410,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year.  

 In addition, SYSCOs fuel costs increased by $34,023,000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased diesel prices. Our fuel costs increased by $21,225,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due to increased diesel prices and increased volume usage. SYSCOs costs per gallon have increased 18.7% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and 7.1% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, fuel costs, excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, represented approximately 0.6%, 0.6% and 0.5% of sales, respectively. SYSCOs activities to manage increased fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques, improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds, entering into forward fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges.  

 We periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. In fiscal 2008, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $21,000,000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. In fiscal 2007, the forward purchase commitments resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices. In fiscal 2006, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $9,000,000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. In July and August 2008, we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately $195,000,000 through July 2009, which will lock in the price on approximately 50% of our fuel purchases through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 and approximately 70% of our fuel purchases needs for the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2009.  

 In fiscal 2008, due to sustained, increased diesel prices, SYSCO increased its use of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges were approximately $27,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. The change in fuel surcharges in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was not significant. Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins.  

 If fuel prices continue at current levels, fuel costs in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009, exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000 as compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008. Our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid-August 2008, the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. We continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset this increase in fuel expense in fiscal 2009, including the continued use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management. If fuel surcharges continue in fiscal 2009 at the same levels as the end of fiscal 2008, we estimate that we can recover about half of the anticipated increase in fuel costs noted above through increased fuel surcharges, which is less than the approximate 75% we were able to recover in fiscal 2008.  

 Customer accounts written off, net of recoveries, were $32,367,000, or 0.09% of sales, $26,010,000 or 0.07% of sales, and $21,128,000 or 0.06% of sales, for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We continue to monitor our customer account balances and believe continued strong credit practices will be necessary to avoid significant increases in write-offs in fiscal 2009. However, if the challenging economic environment persists, we could experience increased levels of write-offs and a higher provision for losses on receivables in fiscal 2009.  

 Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 are expected to increase by approximately $20,000,000 due primarily to lower returns on assets of the qualified pension plan during fiscal 2008, partially offset by a decrease in expense due to amendments to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2009 is expected to decrease $20,000,000 to $25,000,000. The expected decrease is due primarily to two factors. First, option grants in prior years were at greater levels than recent years, resulting in reduced compensation expense being recognized. Secondly, the Management Incentive Plan annual bonus awards have been modified beginning with fiscal 2009, to exclude the previous stock award component. As a result, the share-based compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years will not be incurred in fiscal 2009, and as a result fiscal 2009 will reflect reduced overall share-based based compensation expenses. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we expect to replace the stock award component of the incentive bonuses with annual discretionary restricted stock grants subject to time-based vesting which may result in increased share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010.  

 Net Earnings  

 Net earnings increased 10.5% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Net earnings increased 17.0% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. The changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily to the factors discussed above, as well as the impact of changes in interest expense, other income and income taxes discussed below. Additionally, fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was impacted by a fiscal 2006 accounting change. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, SYSCO recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for company-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits plans, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax.  

 The increase in interest expense of $6,539,000 in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased borrowing levels partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating rate debt. The decrease in interest expense of $4,098,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels.  

 Other income, net increased $5,195,000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and $8,719,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. Changes between the years resulted from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. The increase in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily due to gains from the sale of land and facilities as well as the sale of a minority interest in a business. The increase in fiscal 2007 over the prior year is primarily due to a gain on the sale of land.  

 16  
 The effective tax rate was 38.25% in fiscal 2008, 38.25% in fiscal 2007 and 39.35% in fiscal 2006.  

 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately $7,700,000 resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change, $8,600,000 related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on Canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and $5,500,000 related to the reduction in net Canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions, share-based compensation expense and the recognition of losses to adjust the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values.  

 The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies.  

 Earnings Per Share  

 Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 13.0% and 13.1%, respectively, in fiscal 2008 over the prior year. Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% and 17.6%, respectively, in fiscal 2007 over the prior year. These increases were primarily the result of factors discussed above, as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding. The net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases. The net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and, with regard to fiscal 2008, an increase in the number of anti-dilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation.  

 Segment Results  

 We have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable segments as defined in SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. (SFAS No. 131) The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by SYSCO within the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data within Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the Broadline and SYGMA operating companies. The segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments. These centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments.  

 Prior to fiscal 2008, SYSCOs management evaluated performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective earnings before income taxes. This measure included an allocation of certain corporate expenses to each operating segment in addition to the centrally incurred costs for shared services that were charged to our segments. During fiscal 2008, SYSCOs management increased its focus on the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results which excludes the allocation of additional corporate expenses. As a result, the segment reporting for fiscal 2007 and 2006 has been revised to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. While a segments operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins, expenses, or a combination thereof, each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our long-term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth.  

 The following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segments sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8:

 Broadline Segment  

 Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers. Broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of SYSCOs operations. In fiscal 2008, the Broadline operating results represent approximately 80% of SYSCOs overall sales and greater than 100% of SYSCOs overall operating income prior to corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments.  

 There are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the SYGMA and Other operating segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and purchasing power allow us to leverage this segments earnings.  

 Sales  

 Sales for fiscal 2008 were 8.1% greater than fiscal 2007. Non-comparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 growth was realized both from increased sales to multi-unit customers and marketing associate-served customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers and efforts of our marketing associates. Product cost inflation and the resulting increases in selling prices was the primary contributor to sales growth.  

 Sales for fiscal 2007 were 7.0% greater than fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04-13 reduced sales growth by 0.4%, or $173,171,000, for fiscal 2007 compared to a $57,211,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which is the one-year anniversary of the adoption of EITF 04-13. Non-comparable acquisitions did not have an impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associate-served customers and multi-unit customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers, increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates.  

 Operating Income  

 The increases in operating income in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses. We were able to manage our business effectively in the current inflationary environment by managing margins and improving operating efficiencies. Gross margin dollars increased 7.0% while operating expenses increased 6.1% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. The high cost of fuel also impacted our results. Fuel costs in fiscal 2008 were $21,575,000 higher than fiscal 2007. We attempt to mitigate increased fuel costs by reducing miles driven, improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds, entering into fixed price fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges. In fiscal 2008, due to sustained increased diesel prices, our use of fuel surcharges increased. Fuel surcharges were approximately $21,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.  

 In fiscal 2008, we recorded a provision of $22,284,000 related to additional amounts that we expect to be required to contribute to an underfunded multi-employer pension plan and our withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. In fiscal 2007, we recorded a provision of $4,700,000 related to our withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan.  

 The increases in operating income in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses. Gross margin dollars increased 6.6% while operating expenses increased 5.4% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.  

 18  
 SYGMA Segment  

 SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. SYGMA operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than SYSCOs other segments. This segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins. These operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis.  

 Sales  

 Sales for fiscal 2008 were 4.4% greater than fiscal 2007. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.3% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 growth was generally due to product cost increases and sales to new customers. These increases were partially offset by lost sales due to non-renewed customer agreements and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting SYGMAs customer base.  

 Sales for fiscal 2007 were 6.0% greater than fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04-13 reduced sales growth by 2.7%, or $159,236,000, for fiscal 2007 compared to a $42,560,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which is the one-year anniversary of the adoption of EITF 04-13. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 2.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. The remaining fiscal 2007 growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to increased sales at existing locations as well as new locations added by those customers. In addition, certain customers were transferred from Broadline operations to be serviced by SYGMA operations, contributing to the sales increase.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased as compared to fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, SYGMA expensed $5,587,000 related to the write-off of software development costs . In addition, some of SYGMAs customers have experienced a slowdown in their business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop. SYGMA also experienced increased fuel costs of $8,888,000 although it was able to partially offset these costs through increases in the fees charged to customers including fuel surcharges and reducing expenses. Fuel surcharges were approximately $6,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Expense reductions were accomplished by consolidating regional offices, reducing headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts.  

 The increase in operating income in fiscal 2007 was due to several factors, including sales growth, increased margins and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by costs of labor increases and auto liability related expenses. In addition, the transfer of customers from Broadline operations referred to above also contributed to the increase in operating income.  

 Other Segment  

 Other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments, including our specialty produce, custom-cut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers. These operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under SFAS No. 131.  

 On an aggregate basis, our Other segments have a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than SYSCOs Broadline segment. SYSCO has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years. These operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry. These operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average Broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the Broadline segment. In the aggregate, the Other segment represented approximately 9.7% and 7.3% of SYSCOs overall sales and operating income in fiscal 2008, respectively.  

 Operating income increased 3.3% for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income was generated primarily by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income in the custom-cut meat segment.  

 Operating income increased 6.2% for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was generated by improved results in each of the other segments and acquisitions.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the United States and Canada. We intend to continue to expand our market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. We also strive to increase the effectiveness of our operations through the use of technology and our supply chain and other strategic initiatives. These objectives require continuing investment. Our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets.  

 Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, systems, fleet and other equipment; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional debt. Our share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, to reduce shares outstanding (which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share) and to aid in managing the ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization. Historically, our long-term debt to total capitalization ratio has generally been in the  

 19  
 range of 35% and 40%. This ratio was 36.8% and 35.0% as of June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. For purposes of calculating this ratio, long-term debt includes both the current maturities and long-term portion. We continue to assess and review the most appropriate capital structure as well as the appropriate leverage ratios with which to measure that capital structure. As a part of our on-going strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. These transactions may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability.  

 We believe that our cash flows from operations, the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future, including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.  

 Operating Activities  

 We generated $1,596,129,000 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008, $1,402,922,000 in fiscal 2007 and $1,124,679,000 in fiscal 2006. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was primarily due to net income in these years, reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases in accounts receivable balances, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances. The increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales growth. The accounts payable balances did not increase at the same rate as inventory increases. Accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors, including changes in product mix, cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors.  

 Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in accrued expenses of $22,721,000 during fiscal 2008, and was positively impacted by increases in accrued expenses of $132,936,000 during fiscal 2007 and $29,161,000 during fiscal 2006. The decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below. This decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixed-rate debt issued in fiscal 2008 and an increase to a provision related to a multi-employer pension plan. See additional discussion of multi-employer pension plans at Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Considerations. The increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased accruals for fiscal 2007 incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over fiscal 2006. The increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2006 was related to various miscellaneous accruals.  

 In fiscal 2007, we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of $50,296,000 and the corresponding insurance receivable of $48,296,000, included within prepaid expenses and other current assets. In fiscal 2008, these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment in excess of our deductible. See further discussion of the product liability claim under Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  

 Other long-term liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net, increased $13,459,000 during fiscal 2008, decreased $14,817,000 in fiscal 2007 and increased $75,382,000 in fiscal 2006. The increase in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred compensation from incentive compensation deferrals of prior-year annual incentive bonuses and the accrual of interest on our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. These increases were partially offset by the recording of net company-sponsored pension costs and the timing of pension contributions to our company-sponsored plans. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, the change in these accounts was primarily attributable to the recording of net company-sponsored pension costs and the timing and amount of pension contributions to our company-sponsored plans. In fiscal 2007, our pension contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow. In fiscal 2006, the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash inflow. We recorded net company-sponsored pension costs of $65,837,000, $74,591,000 and $130,592,000 during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Our contributions to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans were $92,670,000, $91,163,000 and $73,764,000 during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $97,000,000 to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans in fiscal 2009.  

 Investing Activities  

 Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 20  
 The lower amount spent in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to delays on certain projects that will shift significant expenditures to fiscal 2009. As a result, we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 to be in the range of $675,000,000 to $725,000,000. Fiscal 2009 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold-out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; the companys National Supply Chain initiative; and investments in technology.  

 Financing Activities  

 Equity  

 We routinely engage in Board-approved share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 16,769,900 shares for $529,179,000 in fiscal 2008, 16,231,200 shares for $550,865,000 in fiscal 2007 and 16,479,800 shares for $544,131,000 in fiscal 2006. An additional 125,000 shares have been purchased at a cost of $3,933,000 through August 13, 2008, resulting in a remaining authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 6,212,800 shares, based on the trades made through that date.  

 Dividends paid were $497,467,000, or $0.82 per share, in fiscal 2008, $445,416,000, or $0.72 per share, in fiscal 2007 and $397,537,000, or $0.64 per share, in fiscal 2006. In May 2008, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 of $0.22 per share, which was paid in July 2008.  

 In November 2000, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 13, 2008, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.  

 Short-term Borrowings  

 We have uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $145,000,000, of which none was outstanding as of June 28, 2008 or August 13, 2008.  

 Commercial Paper  

 We have a commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,300,000,000. The current program was entered into in April 2006 and replaced notes that were issued under our previous commercial paper program as they matured and became due and payable.  

 SYSCO and one of our subsidiaries, SYSCO International, Co., has a revolving credit facility supporting our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility, in the amount of $1,000,000,000, terminates on November 4, 2012, subject to extension.  

 This facility was originally entered into in November 2005 in the amount of $500,000,000 and was increased to $750,000,000 in March 2006. In September 2006, the termination date on the facility was extended to November 4, 2011, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In September 2007, the amount of the facility was increased to $1,000,000,000 and the termination date on the facility was extended to November 4, 2012. This facility replaced the previous $450,000,000 (U.S. dollar) and $100,000,000 (Canadian dollar) revolving credit agreements in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, both of which were terminated in November 2005.  

 During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to $1,133,241,000, $356,804,000 to $755,180,000, $126,846,000 to $774,530,000, respectively. There were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of June 28, 2008 or August 13, 2008.  

 Fixed Rate Debt  

 In July 2005, we repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances.  

 In September 2005, we issued 5.375% senior notes totaling $500,000,000 due on September 21, 2035, under the April 2005 shelf registration. These notes, which were priced at 99.911% of par, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of September 2005.  

 In September 2005, in conjunction with the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes described above, we settled a $350,000,000 notional amount forward-starting interest rate swap we had entered into in March 2005. Upon termination, we paid cash of $21,196,000, which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination. This amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30-year term of the debt, and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income (loss).  

 In May 2006, we repaid at maturity the 7.0% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances.  

 In April 2007, we repaid at maturity the 7.25% senior notes totaling $100,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances.  

 21  
 In January 2008, the SEC granted our request to terminate our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the SEC in April 2005 for the issuance of debt securities. In February 2008, we filed an automatically effective well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $1,000,000,000 in debt securities with the SEC.  

 In February 2008, we issued 4.20% senior notes totaling $250,000,000 due February 12, 2013 (the 2013 notes) and 5.25% senior notes totaling $500,000,000 due February 12, 2018 (the 2018 notes) under our February 2008 shelf registration. The 2013 and 2018 notes, which were priced at 99.835% and 99.310% of par, respectively, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of February 2008.  

 Total Debt  

 Total debt as of June 28, 2008 was $1,980,331,000, of which approximately 99% was at fixed rates averaging 5.4% and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 2.2%. Certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders, including provisions to maintain our long-term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of June 28, 2008.  

 Other  

 As part of normal business activities, we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007, letters of credit outstanding were $35,785,000 and $62,645,000, respectively.  

 Other Considerations  

 Multi-Employer Pension Plans  

 As discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we contribute to several multi-employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.  

 Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit plans, a plans termination, our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi-employer plans unfunded vested liabilities. Based on the information available from plan administrators, we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi-employer plans we participate in, some of which appear to be underfunded, could be as much as $140,000,000 based on a voluntary withdrawal.  

 Required contributions to multi-employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels. In addition, the Pension Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity or a combination of these items. Of the plans in which SYSCO participates, one plan is more critically underfunded than the others. During fiscal 2008, we obtained information that this plan failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and believe it is probable that additional funding will be required as well as the payment of excise tax. As a result, we recorded a liability of approximately $16,500,000 related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods. Currently, we believe that a majority of this amount will be paid in fiscal 2009 and are continuing to explore our alternatives as it relates to this plan. As of June 28, 2008, we have approximately $22,000,000 in liabilities recorded in total related to certain underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plans.  

 BSCC Cooperative Structure  

 Our affiliate, BSCC, is a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States Internal Revenue Code. We believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of BSCC are appropriate under the tax laws. However, if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of BSCC were to be successfully challenged by any federal, state or local tax authority, we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with BSCC that we otherwise have deferred until future periods. In that event, we would be liable for interest on such amounts. As of June 28, 2008, SYSCO has recorded deferred income tax liabilities of $1,054,190,000, net of federal benefit, related to the BSCC supply chain distributions. If the IRS and any other relevant taxing authorities determine that all amounts since the inception of BSCC were inappropriately deferred, and the determination is upheld, we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred, as discussed above, we may be required to pay interest on the cumulative deferred balances. These interest amounts could range from $290,000,000 to $320,000,000, prior to federal and state income tax benefit, as of June 28, 2008. SYSCO calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of BSCC applying the applicable jurisdictions interest rates in effect in each period. The IRS, in connection with its audit of our 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns, proposed adjustments related to the taxability of the cooperative structure. We are vigorously protesting these adjustments. We have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the IRS, and while management believes it is probable we will prevail, we concluded the measurement model of FIN 48 required us to provide an accrual for a portion of the interest exposure. If a taxing authority requires us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest,  

 22  
 if any, we may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or we may have to forego share repurchases or defer planned capital expenditures or a combination of these items.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

 Contractual Obligations  

 The following table sets forth, as of June 28, 2008, certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)   The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods.  

  (2)   Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2017, based on actuarial assumptions.  

  (3)   Excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements.  

  (4)   Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under FIN 48, which we adopted as of July 1, 2007. As of June 28, 2008, we had a liability of $69,830,000 for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and $138,207,000 for related interest that could result in cash payment. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non-current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related non-current balances have not been reflected in the Payments Due by Period section of the table. For further discussion of the impact of adopting FIN 48, see Note 16, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  

  (5)   Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of June 28, 2008, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates.  

  (6)   For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal 2015 (See discussion under Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments. Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required.   

 Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of June 28, 2008 included $55,469,000 in cash. This amount is not included in the table above.  

 No obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of June 28, 2008, we do not have a minimum funding requirement under ERISA guidelines for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions. However, we intend to make voluntary contributions to the qualified retirement plan totaling $80,000,000 during fiscal 2009.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements.  

 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts  

 23  
 receivable, self-insurance programs, company-sponsored pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration, accounting for business combinations and share-based compensation.  

 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

 We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. We utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In addition, in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. Our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.  

 Self-Insurance Program  

 We maintain a self-insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. We also maintain a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented.  

 Company-Sponsored Pension Plans  

 Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets.  

 For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan), which was determined as of the June 30, 2007 measurement date, increased 0.05% to 6.78%. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 30, 2007 measurement date, decreased 0.09% to 6.64%. The combined effect of these discount rate changes was a decrease in our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2008 by an estimated $480,000. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the June 28, 2008 measurement date, increased 0.16% to 6.94%. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 28, 2008 measurement date, increased 0.39% to 7.03%. The combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2009 by an estimated $8,692,000. A 1.0% increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2009 would decrease SYSCOs net company-sponsored pension cost by $32,000,000, while a 1.0% decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by $49,000,000. The impact of a 1.0% increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 1.0% decrease in discount rates because a 1.0% decrease in discount rates would require additional amounts of amortization from net actuarial losses which would not be required with a 1.0% increase in this rate. As of June 28, 2008, our net actuarial losses from our company-sponsored pension plans were $351,344,000, an increase of $192,438,000. We estimate the amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal 2009 pension expense by approximately $14,000,000 as compared to fiscal 2008.  

 We look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. We used a plan specific age-related set of rates for the Retirement Plan, which are equivalent to a single rate of 6.17% as of June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007. As of June 28, 2008, the SERP assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal 2009 depending upon the participants position with the company and a 7% salary growth assumption for all participants for fiscal 2010 and thereafter. As of June 30, 2007, the SERP assumed salary rate increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and 7% thereafter.  

 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 8.50% for fiscal 2008 and 9.00% for fiscal 2007. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long-term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 9.0%, 7.3%, 12.1% and 8.3% over the 20-year, 10-year, 5-year and 1-year periods ended December 31, 2007, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10.0%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.  

 The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan is 8.00% for fiscal 2009. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2009 would decrease (increase) SYSCOs net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2009 by approximately $15,900,000.

 The adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 as of June 30, 2007 resulted in the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2007 after adoption of SFAS 158 was a charge, net of tax, of $125,265,000, which represented the net actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS 87/106 as of that date. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of June 28, 2008 was a charge, net of tax, of $220,913,000.  

 Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the plans, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions, decreased net company-sponsored pension costs by $8,754,000 in fiscal 2008 and are expected to increase net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 by approximately $27,200,000. However, a change in the SERP design is expected to decrease net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 by $7,200,000, for a net increase of approximately $20,000,000.  

 We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans of $92,670,000 and $91,163,000 in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan of $80,000,000 and $80,000,000 in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2009, as in the previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements but we anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of $80,000,000, which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2009. The estimated fiscal 2009 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post-retirement plans together are approximately $17,401,000.  

 Income Taxes  

 The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.  

 Prior to fiscal 2008, in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, we established an accrual when, despite our belief that our tax return positions were supportable, we believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable. When facts and circumstances changed, these accruals were adjusted. Beginning in fiscal 2008, we adopted FIN 48, which changed the accounting for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. (See discussion under Note 16, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8).  

 Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.  

 Vendor Consideration  

 We recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed.  

 Accounting for Business Combinations  

 Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit.  

 In addition, annually or more frequently as needed, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets. The reporting units used in assessing goodwill  

 25  
 impairment are our six operating segments as described in Note 19, Business Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units.  

 We arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating segments. The primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated average sales and earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry, average sales and earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by SYSCO in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units and weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  

 Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. Our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results. SYSCO has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. In fiscal 2008, the reporting units fair values would have had to have been lower by 20% compared to the fair values estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed for any of our reporting units.  

 The Other (specialty produce, custom-cut meat, lodging industry products and international distribution operations) operating segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the Broadline or SYGMA reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the Broadline and SYGMA segments. In addition, these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the Broadline segment. As such, these Other operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn.  

 Share-Based Compensation  

 We provide compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans, the Employees Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive Plan and various non-employee director plans.  

 Effective July 3, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 and later years includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted through July 2, 2005, but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Results for periods prior to fiscal 2006 have not been restated.  

 As of June 28, 2008, there was $66,432,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.88 years.  

 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of SYSCOs stock, implied volatilities from traded options on SYSCOs stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  

 The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price. The fair value of the stock issued under the Management Incentive Plans is based on the stock price less a 12% discount for post-vesting restrictions. The discount for post-vesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period.  

 The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  

 The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the Management Incentive Plan was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made.  

 Certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. In those cases, we will recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance-based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate. In these cases, if it is probable that the performance condition will be met, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the shorter performance period; otherwise, we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period.  

 26  
 In addition, certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds, the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee or director. In these cases, for awards granted prior to July 2, 2005, we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires. For awards granted subsequent to July 3, 2005, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement.  

 Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate.  

 New Accounting Standards  

 SFAS 159  

 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We have decided not to adopt SFAS 159 for our existing financial assets and liabilities at the date of option. Thus, there will be no one-time impact from adoption of this standard to our consolidated financial statements.  

 SFAS 141(R)  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in a business combination. This statement also establishes recognition and measurement principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will apply this statement primarily on a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010. Earlier application of the standard is prohibited.  

 FSP 157-2  

 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which establishes a common definition for fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157-2), which partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non-recurring basis. Consequently, SFAS 157 will be effective for SYSCO in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. As a result of the deferral, SFAS 157 will be effective in fiscal 2010 for non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. We believe the adoption of SFAS 157 in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions of SFAS 157 in fiscal 2010 for non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value.  

 SFAS 161  

 In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. This statement will be effective for SYSCOs financial statements beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 161 may have on its financial statement disclosures.  

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings, the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business, expense trends, anticipated multi-employer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multi-employer pension plans, the outcome of ongoing tax audits, the impact of ongoing legal proceedings, the loss of SYSCOs largest customer not having a material adverse effect on SYSCO as a whole, compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, long-term debt to capitalization ratios, anticipated capital expenditures and the sources of financing for those capital expenditures, continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic business initiatives, anticipated company-sponsored pension  

 27  
 plan liabilities, the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities, the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements, predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses, the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable.  

 These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at Item 1.A. above and elsewhere. In addition, the success of SYSCOs strategic business initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. The ability to meet long-term debt to capitalization ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth. Company-sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Legal proceedings are impacted by events, circumstances and individuals beyond the control of SYSCO. Predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent, and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect, our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect, as well. The anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and laws and regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to change.
