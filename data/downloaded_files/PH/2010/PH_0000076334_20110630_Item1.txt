The Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents.  

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business  

The Companys backlog by business segment for the past two fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-5 to 13-7 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this section by reference. The Companys backlog was $3.8 billion at June 30, 2011 and was $3.1 billion at June 30, 2010. Approximately 86% of the Companys backlog at June 30, 2011 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature.  

Environmental Regulation  

Certain of the Companys operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the United States federal Superfund law, under which the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list.  

- 9 -  

As of June 30, 2011, the Company is involved in environmental remediation at various United States and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a potentially responsible party, along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites.  

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management of efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.  

As of June 30, 2011, the Company had a reserve of $15.3 million for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties.  

The Companys estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $15.3 million to a maximum of $72.1 million. The largest range of the estimated total liability for any one site is approximately $6.1 million. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries.  

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials  

The Companys primary energy source for each of its business segments is electric power. While the Company cannot predict future costs of such electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.  

Steel, brass, copper, aluminum, nickel, rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.  

Employees  

The Company employed approximately 58,400 persons as of June 30, 2011, of whom approximately 30,940 were employed by foreign subsidiaries.
