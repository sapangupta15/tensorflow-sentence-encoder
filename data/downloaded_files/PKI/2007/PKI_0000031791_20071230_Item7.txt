Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations  

Sales  

2007 Compared to 2006. Sales for 2007 were $1,787.3 million, versus $1,546.4 million for 2006, an increase of $241.0 million, or 16%. Changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 4% to the increase in revenue for 2007, as compared to 2006. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2007 as compared to 2006 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales reflects a $182.7 million, or 16%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, due to increases in sales of instruments of $84.5 million, service of $51.3 million, and consumables and reagents of $46.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $58.3 million, or 15%, primarily due to increases in our medical imaging products of $28.4 million, specialty lighting products of $24.8 million, and optical sensors of $4.8 million.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Sales for 2006 were $1,546.4 million versus $1,473.8 million during 2005, an increase of $72.6 million, or 5%. Changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 1% to the increase in revenue for 2006, as compared to 2005. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2006 as compared to 2005 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales includes a $63.5 million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,081.1 million in 2005 to $1,144.6 million in 2006 primarily due to increases in service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8 million and consumables and reagents of $1.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $9.1 million, or 2%, from $392.7 million in 2005 to $401.8 million in 2006 primarily due to sales of our medical imaging products increasing by $15.1 million, while sales within our optical sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.0 million.  

Cost of Sales  

2007 Compared to 2006. Cost of sales for 2007 was $1,062.6 million, versus $918.3 million for 2006, an increase of approximately $144.3 million, or 16%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.5% in 2007 from 59.4% in 2006, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 10 basis points to 40.5% in 2007 from 40.6% in 2006. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 and was $34.4 million for 2007 as compared to $29.2 million for 2006. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in 2007 was approximately $2.5 million for 2007. Stock option expense was $1.2 million and $1.3 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The combined impact of net productivity and capacity improvements within both segments increased gross margin, which was partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of entering into several large new contracts requiring an increase in start-up investment in the first six months of 2007 and a one-time charge related to flash module contracts in our Optoelectronics segment.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Cost of sales for 2006 was $918.3 million, versus $859.3 million for 2005, an increase of $59.0 million, or 7%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.4% in 2006 from 58.3% in 2005, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points to 40.6% in 2006 from 41.7% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $29.2 million in 2006 as compared to $27.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), cost of sales for 2006 also included stock option expense of $1.3 million. No stock option expense was recorded in 2005. The remaining decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006, partially offset by efficiencies gained through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

2007 Compared to 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2007 were $444.4 million as compared to $376.8 million for 2006, an increase of approximately $67.6 million, or 18%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.9% in 2007, compared to 24.4% in 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $7.9 million for 2007 as compared to $3.0 million for 2006. Stock option expense was $7.3 million and $7.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of increased headcount and employee-related expenses to support our sales initiatives, increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions, business development expenses, amortization expense related to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006, foreign exchange and stock option expense.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 were $376.8 million, versus $365.5 million for 2005, an increase of $11.4 million, or 3%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 40 basis points to 24.4% in 2006 from 24.8% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $3.0 million in 2006 as compared to $0.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 also included $7.2 million of stock option expense, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. This decrease was the result of increased fixed cost leverage and cost controls, offset in part by increased investment in business development activities, stock option expense and an increase in the number of sales employees in emerging markets and higher growth product lines.  

Research and Development Expenses  

2007 Compared to 2006. Research and development expenses for 2007 were $111.6 million versus $99.7 million for 2006, an increase of $11.9 million, or 12%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 6.2% in 2007 from 6.4% in 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.7 million for 2007 as compared to $1.6 million for 2006. Research and development expenses also included stock option expense of $0.6 million and $0.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. We directed our research and development efforts similarly during 2007 and 2006, primarily toward genetic screening, BioDiscovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Research and development expenses for 2006 were $99.7 million versus $87.4 million in 2005, an increase of $12.3 million, or 14%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 6.4% in 2006 from 5.9% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.6 million in 2006 as compared to $0.1 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), research and development expenses for 2006 also included $0.7 million of stock option expense, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. We directed research and development efforts during 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening, BioDiscovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging within our Optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.  

In-process Research and Development Charge  

2007 Compared to 2006. In-process research and development (IPR&D) charge for 2007 was $1.5 million, which related to the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen. In determining the value of the in-process projects, we considered, among other factors, the in-process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. We utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset, including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date, and the amount represents managements best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects.

2006 Compared to 2005. We did not take an IPR&D charge in either 2006 or 2005.  

Gains on Settlement of Insurance Claim  

2007 Compared to 2006. During the second quarter of 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, we recorded gains of $15.3 million during the second quarter of 2007. We received the final settlement payment of $21.5 million in June 2007, and had previously received during 2005 and 2006 a total of $35.0 million in advance payments towards costs incurred, and for building, inventory and equipment damages. Of the $56.5 million in total settlement proceeds received by us, $25.6 million related to reimbursement of costs incurred; $23.7 million related to damages to the building, inventory and equipment; and $7.2 million related to business interruption costs which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.  

During the second quarter of 2007, we accrued $9.7 million representing our managements estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building, and anticipate that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.  

Restructuring and Lease Charges (Reversals), Net  

2007 Compared to 2006. We have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of our business units. Restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). Restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net, for 2007 were a $14.4 million charge versus a $3.6 million reversal for 2006.  

The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2007, 2006 and 2005:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

The purpose of the Company restructuring plans approved in the first and fourth quarters of 2007, detailed below, was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs.  

Q4 2007 Plan  

During the fourth quarter of 2007, our management approved a plan to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy (the Q4 2007 Plan). As a result of the Q4 2007 Plan, we recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from these reorganization activities. We also recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction and the partial closure of a facility, which was offset by the recognition of a $2.2 million deferred gain from the sales-leaseback of that facility during the fiscal year 2001.  

As part of our Q4 2007 Plan, we reduced headcount by 90 employees. All actions related to the Q4 2007 Plan were completed by December 30, 2007, and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $4.3 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, and the remaining payments of $4.3 million for the partial facility closure will be paid through fiscal year 2022, in accordance with the terms of the lease. The lease payments will be offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the sales-leaseback of that facility during the fiscal year 2001.  

The following table summarizes the components of the Q4 2007 Plan activity recognized in 2007 by segment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Q1 2007 Plan  

During the first quarter of 2007, our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. As a result of this plan, we recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $4.4 million during the first quarter of 2007 (the Q1 2007 Plan). The actions within the Q1 2007 Plan related to a workforce reduction resulting from reorganization activities within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment.  

As part of our Q1 2007 Plan, we reduced headcount by 60 employees. All actions related to the Q1 2007 Plan were completed by March 30, 2007, and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $1.1 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.

ViaCell Plan  

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As of December 30, 2007, we recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF 95-3). We had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition. As part of our ViaCell Plan, we reduced headcount by five employees, and we anticipate that the payments of $1.2 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans  

The principal actions of these restructuring plans were workforce reductions related to the integration of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses, which is now our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. During 2007, we paid $0.2 million related to the 2001 to 2006 restructuring and integration plans and recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to these plans, due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. As of December 30, 2007, we had approximately $2.0 million of remaining liabilities associated with these plans, primarily relating to remaining lease obligations related to closed facilities in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through fiscal year 2014. We anticipate that the remaining severance payments will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.  

Lease Charges  

To facilitate the sale of a business in 2001, we were required to guarantee the obligations that the buyer of the business assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operates. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business, in the event the buyer defaults under the lease, we are responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses. As an additional measure to facilitate the sale of the business, we obtained a letter of credit as partial security for a loan to the buyer, which could have been drawn upon by the buyers lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan. During the second quarter of 2007, the lessor of the building began the process to evict the buyer as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses, and sought reimbursement from us. As a result of this action, we recorded a charge of $4.5 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the potential drawdown of the letter of credit. During the third quarter of 2007, the buyer completed a recapitalization of the business with another lender. The proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay off the remaining balance on the original securitized loan, as well as to make certain payments to the landlord for back rent and other obligations arising under the lease. We were released from our obligation under the letter of credit on the original securitized loan. As a result of these actions, we recorded a reversal of $1.4 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the release of the letter of credit in the third quarter of 2007. We are still responsible for the remaining accrual of $3.1 million, which relates to the remaining lease and building obligations, reduced by estimated sublease rentals reasonably expected to be obtained for the property.  

Impairment of Assets  

2007 Compared to 2006. Impairment of assets was zero in 2007 and $3.2 million in 2006. The 2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.

2006 Compared to 2005. Impairment of assets was $3.2 million in 2006 and zero in 2005. The 2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.  

Gains on Dispositions  

2007 Compared to 2006. There were no dispositions in 2007 and dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2006. Gain on dispositions in 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9 million gain on disposal of certain fixed assets.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2006 and in 2005. Gain on dispositions in 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9 million gain on disposal of fixed assets. Gain on dispositions in 2005 included a $2.0 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in certain manufacturing facilities offset by a $0.5 million loss on disposal of certain fixed assets due to a facility upgrade.  

Interest and Other Expense, Net  

Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2007 Compared to 2006. Interest and other expense, net for 2007 was $16.9 million versus $2.7 million for 2006, an increase of $14.2 million. The increase in interest and other expense, net, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the higher outstanding debt balances, as well as lower outstanding cash balances. Interest income decreased $4.7 million due to lower overall cash balances, and interest expense increased $6.2 million due to higher outstanding debt balances. We also recognized a net gain on dispositions of investments of $0.7 million associated with the dissolution of certain investments. Other expenses for 2007 and 2006 increased by $1.7 million, and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency translation and business development related costs. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Interest and other expense, net for 2006 was $2.7 million versus $74.3 million for 2005, a decrease of $71.6 million or 96%. The decrease in interest and other expense, net in 2006 as compared to 2005, was due primarily to the overall reduction in outstanding debt, lower borrowing costs, an increase in outstanding cash balances and extinguishment of debt from 2005. Interest income increased $6.1 million due to higher cash balances and higher investment rates. In addition, interest expense decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the repurchase of our senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013, which we repurchased through a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005, and the repayment of the remainder of our term loan. The decrease in interest expense resulting from the debt reduction in 2005 was partially offset by interest on $151.5 million in funds drawn under our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2006, which we entered into during the fourth quarter of 2005 and amended and restated in August 2007. We also recognized a net gain on dispositions of investments of $2.3 million associated with the dissolution of certain investments. We incurred a nonrecurring charge of $54.9 million in 2005 to repay our senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013. Other expenses in 2006 and 2005 consisted primarily of expense related to foreign currency translation.

Provision for Income Taxes  

2007 Compared to 2006. The 2007 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $17.5 million, as compared to a provision of $32.4 million for 2006. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 11.5% for 2007 as compared to 21.5% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 was primarily due to the favorable settlement of an income tax audit partially offset by (i) the non-deductible IPR&D charge of $1.5 million recorded in 2007; (ii) the discrete accrual of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 in 2007; (iii) the accrual of U.S. taxes on the $15.3 million gains on the settlement of an insurance claim for 2007; and (iv) changes in our forecasted geographic distribution of earnings.  

2006 Compared to 2005. The 2006 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $32.4 million, versus a provision of $0.1 million in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 21.5% as compared to the 2005 effective tax rate of 0.2%. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to (i) a benefit from the settlement of income tax audits for prior years in 2005, offset by the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and experimental credits, and state current year income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences segment.  

In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the Tax Act) was enacted. The Tax Act retroactively restored the expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from December 31, 2006, and extended the credit through December 31, 2007. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in 2006 in the amount of $1.6 million.  

Discontinued Operations  

As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006.  

We recorded the following gains and losses, which have been reported as the gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations during the three years ended:

Following the ViaCell acquisition in November 2007, our Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte SM business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. We have determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies who focus on the market for such products. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses. We have classified the results of the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.  

In September 2005, our Board approved a plan to divest our Fluid Sciences segment. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of three businessesAerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005, we sold the Fluid Testing division for approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, we sold the Aerospace business for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $250.6 million. These gains were recognized during fiscal 2005 as gains on the dispositions of discontinued operations. We received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately $360.0 million. During 2006, we finalized the net working capital adjustments associated with the sales of these businesses, settled a claim related to an employee benefit program, and ceased future benefit accruals to a postretirement medical plan. In 2006, these actions resulted in the recognition of a gain of $0.5 million and a loss of $0.2 million relative to the Aerospace business and the Fluid Testing business, respectively. In February 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. A pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration, was recognized in 2006. During 2007, we settled an additional commitment associated with a benefit program relating to the divestiture of the Fluid Sciences segment and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.1 million.  

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre-tax gain of $0.2 million in 2007, a pre-tax loss of $0.7 million in 2006 and a pre-tax gain of $1.4 million in 2005. During 2007 and 2006, we substantially completed the remediation of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of pre-tax losses of $0.7 million in 2007 and $1.7 million in 2006. In addition, we received proceeds of $0.5 million upon the sale of the Lithography business and recognized a pre-tax loss of $3.3 million during fiscal year 2005. Also in fiscal year 2005, the completion of the shutdown of the Fiber Optics Test Equipment business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $5.2 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.  

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows:

Acquisitions  

Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constitutes the newborn metabolic screening (NMS) business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. The NMS business provides neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and various states. This acquisition is intended to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. This transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008.  

ViaCell, Inc. In November 2007, our wholly owned subsidiary completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell, at a price of $7.25 per share. ViaCell specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. Through the tender offer, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired more than 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of ViaCell by means of a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into ViaCell, as a result of which ViaCell became our wholly owned subsidiary. The addition of ViaCells ViaCord® product offering for the preservation of umbilical cord blood, and its sales and marketing organization, is expected to facilitate the expansion of our neonatal and prenatal businesses. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately $295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As of December 30, 2007, we recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF 95-3). We had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition.  

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyteSM business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. We have determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies which focus on the market for such products. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses. We have classified the results of the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.  

Various Intangible Assets and Investments. In 2007, we acquired various licenses, other intangible assets and investments for aggregate consideration of approximately $8.8 million in cash. Included in this amount are a customer list for reagents for approximately $4.8 million, and a call option to purchase the assets and liabilities of a company for approximately $1.2 million, each purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, we entered into various long-term license agreements during 2007 for approximately $2.8 million. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.  

Remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. In June 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. (PKI India), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting Indias life science and analytical instrumentation markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition establishes PKI India as our wholly owned subsidiary. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $1.3 million in cash plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which we paid $0.2 million during the fiscal year 2007. We expect to pay the remaining $0.5 million in quarterly installments through the first quarter of 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Improvision Ltd. In March 2007, we acquired the stock of Improvision Ltd. (Improvision), a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research. We expect that the addition of Improvisions imaging and analysis software to our high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions for analyzing cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $23.6 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. During 2007, we paid $0.6 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Euroscreen Products S.A. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (Euroscreen), a developer of the AequoScreen cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Evotec Technologies GmbH. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (Evotec). The acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotecs high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, which was paid in fiscal year 2006. During 2007, we received $1.2 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis Product Line from Triton Technology Ltd. In December 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) product line from Triton Technology Ltd. The DMA products offer a thermal analysis tool that is used by scientists in the polymers, pharmaceuticals and food industries for diverse applications ranging from simple quality control to advanced research. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $2.3 million in cash at the closing, plus additional cash payments of approximately $1.6 million that were paid during the first six months of 2007. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.  

Avalon Instruments Limited. In September 2006, we acquired the stock of Avalon Instruments Limited (Avalon). The acquisition of Avalon expands and complements our molecular spectroscopy product portfolio by adding a family of innovative bench-top dispersive Raman spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy identifies and characterizes the composition of both organic and inorganic materials in a wide range of applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $5.3 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

J.N. Macri Technologies LLC and NTD Laboratories, Inc. In July 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC (Macri) and acquired the stock of NTD Laboratories, Inc. (NTD). We acquired Macris global patents related to free beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (free Beta hCG). Free Beta hCG is a peptide hormone produced in the early stage of pregnancy that is widely recognized as an important biomarker for first-trimester prenatal risk assessment. NTD is a laboratory specializing in prenatal risk assessment and offers laboratory-developed and validated testing under the brand name UltraScreen®, of which free Beta hCG is an important component. Aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $56.65 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill. None of the goodwill related to the NTD acquisition is tax deductible and all of the goodwill related to the Macri acquisition is tax deductible.

Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. In June 2006, we acquired the stock of Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. (C&A), a scientific equipment asset and managed maintenance company serving the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare markets. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $16.0 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Spectral Genomics, Inc. In April 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of Spectral Genomics, Inc. (Spectral), a leader in molecular karyotyping technology used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $14.0 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. We will make royalty payments based on future sales to license additional intellectual property rights from a third party. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.  

Agilix Corporation. In February 2006, we acquired specified assets of Agilix Corporation (Agilix) for approximately $8.7 million in cash. Assets acquired primarily relate to Agilixs core technology which centers around labeling technology using isobaric mass tags that allow for the simultaneous quantification of molecules, such as proteins, from multiple samples. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.  

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed during 2007 and 2006 are reported within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on managements estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The excess purchase price over those assigned values was recorded as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will be reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased intangibles with finite lives will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.  

IPR&D charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. On the date of the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen, there were multiple IPR&D efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines. In determining the value of in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. For these acquisitions, we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset, including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. For the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen, we estimated the value of the IPR&D to be $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions, and the amount represents managements best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the projects. The fair value of acquired in-process research and development costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at Evotec and Euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use.

In connection with purchase price and related allocations, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed in connection with these acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after consummation. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation. As a result of purchase accounting, we recognized the deferred revenue related to the ViaCell acquisition at fair value, and did not recognize $18.1 million of deferred revenue that would have been otherwise recorded in future periods. We would have recorded higher storage revenues in fiscal 2007 in the amount of $1.0 million, as well as significantly higher amounts in future periods, related to these contracts. ViaCell customers have historically renewed these contracts, although there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future.  

As of December 30, 2007, the purchase price allocations for the Agilix, Spectral, C&A, Macri, NTD, Avalon, the DMA product line, Evotec, Euroscreen, Improvision and PKI India acquisitions have been finalized. As of December 30, 2007, the purchase price and related allocations for the ViaCell acquisition were preliminary, and may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase price, as well as additional information regarding liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities, deferred taxes, employee severance and facility closure costs, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase. We are not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates, and we expect to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the date of acquisition.  

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters  

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.2 million as of December 30, 2007, which represents our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.  

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, Enzo) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.,   

41  

Table of Contents 

 Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzos patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzos patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzos patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzos patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzos patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.  

On October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against one of our subsidiaries and alleging that our ViewLux  and certain of our Image FlashPlate products infringe three of Amershams patents related to high-throughput screening (the NJ case). On August 18, 2004, Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the UK case). On October 29, 2003, we filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amershams IN Cell Analyzer, and LEADseeker Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our patents related to high-throughput screening (the MA case). After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006 that Amershams patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to us. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006, the court in the NJ case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amershams patents that adopted many of Amershams claim construction positions. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in November 2007 to resolve all of the foregoing matters.  

In 2002, PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. (PharmaStem) filed suit against ViaCell, Inc., which is now our wholly owned subsidiary, and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (PharmaStem I). After several years of proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid. PharmaStem filed a certiorari petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate courts decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement decision. PharmaStem had also filed a second complaint against ViaCell and other defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and 6,569,427, which also relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (PharmaStem II). We believe that the issues presented in PharmaStem II, which was subsequently consolidated in the District of Delaware with similar cases brought by PharmaStem against other family cord blood banks, are substantially the same as the issues presented in PharmaStem I, and that ViaCell does not infringe the patents at issue in the second case and that those patents are invalid for the same reasons as cited by the Court of Appeals in PharmaStem I. The Delaware court granted ViaCells motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings in PharmaStem II pending the outcome of PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. PTO) on certain patent re-examination issues. Although the U.S. PTO had previously issued notice of its intent to allow the remaining claims of all of the patents, the U.S. PTO subsequently decided to begin the process of re-examining each patent. ViaCell has informed the Delaware Court overseeing PharmaStem II of the status of the re-examinations and that the Federal Circuit had ruled in its favor in the PharmaStem I case. The Delaware Court has yet to take any action in response to these notices.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters, or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.  

During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. There was a single open issue related to this audit which we favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of 2007. We are under regular examination by tax authorities in the United States and other countries (such as China, Indonesia, Philippines and the United Kingdom) in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits as required by FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in managements judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.  

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although, we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 30, 2007 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.  

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations  

Life and Analytical Sciences  

2007 Compared to 2006. Sales for 2007 were $1,327.2 million, versus $1,144.6 million for 2006, an increase of $182.7 million, or 16%, which includes an approximate 5% increase from acquisitions and an approximate 4% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for 2007, as compared to 2006, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Our laboratory service sales increased by $51.3 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased by $49.1 million, sales to BioDiscovery customers increased by $41.6 million, and sales to analytical sciences customers increased by $40.7 million. Sales by type of product included increases in instruments of $84.5 million, service of $51.3 million, and consumables and reagents of $46.9 million.  

Operating income for 2007 was $128.8 million, as compared to $115.4 million for 2006, an increase of $13.4 million, or 12%. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 and was $41.4 million for 2007, as compared to $31.3 million for 2006. Restructuring and lease charges were $8.7 million for 2007 as a result of our Q1 2007 and Q4 2007 Plans, as compared to reversals of $1.7 million in 2006. Amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory and IPR&D from certain acquisitions completed in 2007 were $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for 2007. Stock option expense was $3.4 million and $3.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gains on the settlement of the insurance claim for the March 2005 fire in our Boston, Massachusetts facility were $15.3 million for 2007. Increased sales volume and higher net productivity increased operating income, partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of entering into several large new contracts requiring an increase in start-up investment in the first six months of 2007.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Sales for 2006 were $1,144.6 million, versus $1,081.1 million in 2005, an increase of $63.5 million, or 6%. Changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 1% to the

 increase in revenue for 2006, as compared to 2005. The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Our laboratory service sales increased by $31.8 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased by $24.8 million, and sales to analytical sciences customers increased by $16.7 million, while sales to BioDiscovery customers decreased by $9.9 million. Sales by type of product included increases in service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8 million, and consumables and reagents of $1.9 million.  

Operating income for 2006 was $115.4 million, versus $110.2 million for 2005, an increase of $5.2 million, or 5%. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2006 and was $31.3 million for 2006, as compared to $26.2 million for 2005. Operating income for 2006 includes stock option expense of $3.2 million, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. Restructuring reversals were $1.7 million for 2006 as compared to a charge of $12.9 million for 2005. Increased sales volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives also increased operating income, which were more than offset by unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures, and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006.  

Optoelectronics  

2007 Compared to 2006. Sales for 2007 were $460.1 million, versus $401.8 million for 2006, an increase of $58.3 million, or 15%, which includes an approximate 3% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for 2007, as compared to 2006, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations. The increase in sales was a result of an increase of $28.4 million in our medical imaging products due to the performance of our amorphous silicon business, an increase in our specialty lighting products of $24.8 million primarily due to the performance of photoflash products, specifically in the mobile phone camera modules, and an increase in optical sensors of $4.8 million.  

Operating income for 2007 was $76.5 million, versus $70.0 million for 2006, an increase of $6.5 million, or 9%. Restructuring and lease charges, net of reversals, were $5.7 million for 2007, as a result of our Q4 2007 restructuring plan and lease costs associated with the sale of a business from 2001. Restructuring reversals were $1.9 million for 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.7 million and $2.5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock option expense was $1.4 million and $1.6 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increased sales volume and capacity and productivity improvements made within the amorphous silicon business also increased operating income, which was partially offset by a one-time charge related to flash module investments.  

2006 Compared to 2005. Sales for 2006 were $401.8 million, versus $392.7 million for 2005, an increase of $9.1 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates had minimal impact on the increase in revenue for 2006, as compared to 2005. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Sales of our medical imaging products increased by $15.1 million while sales within our optical sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.0 million due to a decrease in Cermax® video and specific military platforms.  

Operating income for 2006 was $70.0 million, versus $58.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million, or 20%. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.5 million for 2006 and $2.6 million for 2005. Operating income for 2006 includes stock option expense of $1.6 million, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. Restructuring reversals were $1.9 million for 2006 as compared to a charge of $9.2 million for 2005. In addition, 2005 included a $0.2 million charge for in-process research and development related to the acquisition of the capital stock of Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode (LED) solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. Successful execution of productivity initiatives also increased operating income, which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix, pricing pressures and inflation including commodity costs during 2006, as well as capacity issues within the amorphous silicon business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long-term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term liabilities.  

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:  

       deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and  

       changes in our working capital requirements.  

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:  

       financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,  

       increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,  

       a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,  

       volatility in the markets for corporate debt,  

       a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and  

       volatility in the public equity markets.  

Cash Flows  

Fiscal Year 2007  

Operating Activities. Net cash provided by continuing operations was $207.1 million in 2007, compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of $127.0 million in 2006, an increase of $80.1 million, driven primarily by the $1.3 million of divestiture tax refunds that occurred in 2007 as compared to the $60.3 million of taxes paid on divestitures in 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was also driven by income from continuing operations of $133.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $78.0 million and restructuring and lease charges of $14.4 million. These amounts were partially offset by $15.3 million from the settlement of an insurance claim and a net increase in working capital of $5.0 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in 2007, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $29.7 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $24.4 million, and a decrease in inventory of $0.3 million. In both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments the timing of strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased the accounts receivable balance, which was offset by the timing of accounts payable disbursements in the same quarter. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility in 2007, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, net, totaled $0.1 million in 2007, and primarily related to timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.  

Investing Activities. Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $350.1 million in 2007, compared to $140.0 million of cash used in continuing operations investing activities in 2006. Included in 2007 were payments of $1.0 million related to business development costs. In addition, we used $312.7 million of net cash for acquisitions and used $3.2 million in related transaction costs, earn-out payments, acquired licenses and other costs in connection with these and other transactions. Capital expenditures in 2007 were $47.0 million,

 mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases, in addition to the improvements in our amorphous silicon facility within our Optoelectronics segment. These cash outflows were partially offset by $10.8 million received from the settlement of an insurance claim, $1.6 million from the surrender of life insurance policies, and $1.4 million from the sale of investments.  

Financing Activities. Net cash provided by continuing operations financing activities was $148.9 million in 2007, compared to $313.5 million of cash used in continuing operations financing activities in 2006. In 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $203.0 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases in 2006 of $190.1 million. We also paid $4.2 million to settle forward interest rate contracts, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, and $0.8 million for debt issuance costs. These uses of cash were offset in part by $32.8 million of proceeds from common stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. Debt borrowings from our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and interim unsecured credit facility in 2007 totaled $271.5 million and $300.0 million, respectively, offset by debt reductions to our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $212.4 million and other credit facilities of $1.3 million. This compares to debt reductions in 2006 of $110.7 million. In addition, we paid $33.7 million in dividends in 2007.  

Fiscal Year 2006  

Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $127.0 million in 2006, compared to net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities of $192.9 million in 2005. Principal contributors to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2006 were net income from continuing operations of $118.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $69.2 million. These amounts were offset in part by taxes paid on divestitures of $60.3 million, net gain from dispositions of property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million, net gain from settlement of investments of $2.3 million, and a net increase in working capital of $9.4 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in 2006, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in inventory of $11.1 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.7 million, offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.3 million. Strong performance in accounts receivable collections in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment was partially offset by increased accounts payable disbursements in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. The increase in inventory was primarily the result of expanding the amount of inventory held at service locations within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2006, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities, and other items totaled $13.0 million during 2006, and primarily relates to timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.  

Investing Activities. Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $140.0 million in 2006, compared to $333.3 million of cash provided by continuing operations investing activities in 2005. Included in 2006 was $25.0 million of net proceeds received from the sale of our Semiconductor business unit and $6.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of investments. This was offset by approximately $129.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions. In addition, we incurred $12.1 million of business development transaction costs, earn-out payments and other costs in connection with these and previous transactions. Capital expenditures in 2006 were $44.5 million, mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases, in addition to facility improvements. These cash outflows were partially offset by $5.3 million from the advance and settlement of an insurance claim, $4.9 million received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and $3.8 million from the settlement of life insurance policies.  

Financing Activities. Net cash used in continuing operations financing activities was $313.5 million in 2006, compared to $217.6 million in 2005, an increase of $95.9 million, or 44%. In 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. Debt reductions during 2006 totaled $110.7 million, compared to reductions in 2005 of $374.7 million. These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $21.5 million and the related tax benefit of $2.2 million. In addition, we paid $35.5 million in dividends during 2006.

Current Borrowing Arrangements  

Amended Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. On August 13, 2007, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement for the facility provides for a $500.0 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility through August 13, 2012, and amends and restates in its entirety the senior credit agreement dated as of October 31, 2005. The agreement contains an option to increase the facility up to $650.0 million. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15.0 million were issued under our previous facility, which are treated as issued under our amended facility. We use the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 30, 2007 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of December 30, 2007 was 4.86%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 5.26%. We had drawn down approximately $216.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of December 30, 2007, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and those contained in our previous senior revolving credit agreement. The financial covenants in our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is down-graded below investment grade. The financial covenants in our previous senior revolving credit agreement included interest coverage and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. At all times during 2007, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.  

Prior to February 28, 2008, we exercised the option to increase the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. We had borrowed approximately $216.0 million in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of February 28, 2008, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate.  

Unsecured Interim Credit Facility. On November 14, 2007, we entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility. We entered into this unsecured interim credit facility in order to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of the ViaCell acquisition. This interim credit facility matures on March 31, 2008, at which point all amounts outstanding are due in full. The interest rates for this interim credit facility are based on either the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or on the base rate as in effect from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under this interim credit facility to interest based upon either the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin for this interim credit facility as of December 30, 2007 was 62.5 basis points. The applicable Eurocurrency margin will increase by 12.5 basis points from and after January 1, 2008 for all outstanding borrowings. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of December 30, 2007 was 5.03%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 5.65%. We had drawn down approximately $300.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of December 30, 2007, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for this facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, and are consistent with those contained in the agreement for our amended unsecured revolving credit facility, which is described above. 

We anticipate using the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to settle any outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March 2008, and have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Receivables Securitization Facility. During 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, we sold, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are sold. Our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million. Under the terms of this arrangement, our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $79.0 million as of December 30, 2007 and $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006. At each of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, an undivided interest of $45.0 million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $34.0 million and $22.8 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.  

The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date. At December 30, 2007, the effective interest rate was LIBOR plus approximately 80 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poors Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moodys Investors Service. At December 30, 2007, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB, with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Services, and of Baa3, with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service. In January 2008, our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to January 23, 2009.  

Dividends   

Our Board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2007 and 2006, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share.  

Contractual Obligations  

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 30, 2007:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amounts do not contemplate interest obligations.  

 **  The FIN No. 48 amount includes accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties. We have excluded $36.2 million, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, from the amount related to our

 uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.  

 *** The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amounts do not contemplate interest obligations. Prior to February 28, 2008, we exercised the option to increase the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. We anticipate using funds from the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to settle any outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March 2008, and have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.  

Capital Expenditures  

During 2008, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in 2007, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, to increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.  

Other Potential Liquidity Considerations  

On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program.  

During 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in November 2005.  

The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  

In connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005, we accrued $9.7 million during the second quarter of 2007, representing our managements estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.  

Our businesses are not materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. However, increasing or high interest rates and/or widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid, may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses, and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. For example, beginning in the second half of 2007, difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets in the United States and elsewhere resulted in a relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the availability of credit and a corresponding increase in funding costs. Credit spreads widened significantly, affecting volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity markets. These conditions have persisted through the end of 2007 and we cannot predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected. Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our   

49  

Table of Contents 

 liquidity and results of operations. In difficult credit markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities. This could cause us to curtail our business activities and could increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability.  

Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement  

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.  

As a result of the adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, we adjusted the carrying value of our uncertain tax positions and reduced our accrued liabilities by $3.6 million, which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. As of the adoption date, we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million, of which $36.0 million, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect goodwill and discontinued operations. However, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will effect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). We had accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $7.3 million, which is not included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million.  

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 157 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments, and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements to be immaterial.  

In March 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06-10, Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements (EITF No. 06-10). EITF No. 06-10 provides guidance for determining a liability for the post-retirement benefit obligation as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment agreement. We will be required to adopt EITF No. 06-10 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of EITF No. 06-10 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities (EITF No. 07-3). EITF No. 07-3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered   

50  

Table of Contents 

 for future research and development activities be deferred, capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed. We will be required to adopt EITF No. 07-3, on a prospective basis, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of EITF No. 07-3 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.  

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

Revenue recognition. We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.  

Warranty Costs. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period.  

51  

Table of Contents 

Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings.  

Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.  

Business Combinations. The allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on managements estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.  

Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles. We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. We completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets.

Employee compensation and benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $12.5 million in 2007, $10.2 million in 2006 and $11.9 million in 2005 for our retirement and postretirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $8.2 million in 2008 for our retirement and postretirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of December 30, 2007, we estimated the expected long-term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5% and was 7.6% for all plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one-quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by $0.6 million for 2008 in the United States and by $0.5 million for 2008 for all plans outside the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre-tax pension expense by $2.4 million for 2008 in the United States and by $1.1 million for 2008 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.  

Restructuring activities. Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles. Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net.  

Gains or losses on dispositions. When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended December 30, 2007, we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets. We recorded $1.2 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings, and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement.

Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.  

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.  

Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, other income tax credits and certain pension accruals. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate.
