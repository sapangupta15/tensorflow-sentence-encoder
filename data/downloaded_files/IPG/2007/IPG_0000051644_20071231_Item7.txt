Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

 The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company, Interpublic, we, us or our). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Our MD&A includes the following sections:  

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.  

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2007 compared to 2006 and 2006 compared to 2005.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds.  

 OTHER MATTERS provides a discussion of other significant items which may impact our financial statements.  

 RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a description of accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our future operations.  

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

 We are one of the worlds premier advertising and marketing services companies. Our agency brands deliver custom marketing solutions to many of the worlds largest marketers. Our companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from consumer advertising and direct marketing to mobile and search engine marketing. Major global brands include Draftfcb, FutureBrand, GolinHarris International, Initiative, Jack Morton Worldwide, Lowe Worldwide (Lowe), MAGNA Global, McCann Erickson, Momentum, MRM, Octagon, Universal McCann and Weber Shandwick. Leading domestic brands include Campbell-Ewald, Carmichael Lynch, Deutsch, Hill Holliday, Mullen and The Martin Agency.  

 The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs. Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving one agency and its client to long-term, fully-integrated campaigns created by a group of our companies working together on behalf of a client. With offices in over 100 countries, we can operate in a single region or align work globally across all major world markets. Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client activity.  

 Our strategy is focused on improving our organic revenue growth and operating income. We are working to achieve significant improvements in our organic revenue growth and operating margins, with our ultimate objective to be fully competitive with our industry peer group on both measures.  

 We analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, with the remainder considered the organic change. For purposes of analyzing this change, acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred.  

 We have strategically realigned a number of our capabilities to promote revenue growth. For example, we have combined accountable marketing and consumer advertising to form the global offering Draftfcb and

 implemented a differentiated approach to media by aligning our largest media assets with our global brand agencies. We continue to develop our capacity in strategically critical areas, notably digital, marketing services and media, that we expect will drive future revenue growth. The digital component of our business continues to evolve and is increasingly vital to all of our agencies. In order to grow with our clients, we have accelerated our investment in talent, professional development and technology throughout the organization.  

 To further improve our operating margin we continue to focus on the following areas:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. The weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies of many countries in which we operate contributed to higher revenues and operating expenses. In particular, during 2007 and 2006, the U.S. Dollar was weaker against the Euro, Pound Sterling, Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 impact was also due to the strength of the Australian Dollar compared to 2006. The average value of the Euro and Pound Sterling, currencies in which the majority of our international operations are conducted, each strengthened approximately 9% against the U.S. Dollar during 2007. Foreign currency variations resulted in increases of approximately 3% in revenues, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses in 2007 compared to 2006.  

 As discussed in more detail in this MD&A, for 2007 compared to 2006:

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

 Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and notes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

 Revenue Recognition  

 Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across various agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, it is possible for a global, regional and local agreement to be initiated. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.  

 Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

 Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred. There are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are project-based and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs.  

 Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements, because of various pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue  

 18   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, we assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses. Revenue is reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.  

 The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could significantly affect our financial performance. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis, it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.  

 We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned. Negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement could result in either payments to the client in excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual liability. These items, referred to as concessions, relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as operating expense or income. Concession income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in September 2005 (the 2004 Restatement). In these situations, and given the historical nature of these liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating results. See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

 Stock-Based Compensation  

 We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. Compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.  

 We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the options expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and our results of operations could be materially impacted. The expected volatility factor is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of our tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell shares of our common stock. The expected term is based on the average of an assumption that outstanding options are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and will be exercised at the midpoint between the current date (i.e., the date awards have been ratably vested through) and their full contractual term. Additionally, we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate which impacts our recorded expense. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

 Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes.  

 Under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. SFAS 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recognized when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is significant negative evidence, establishment of valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS 109. A pattern of sustained profitability is considered significant positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings.  

 On January 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold and then we apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

 We account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair market values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill.  

 We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 15 reporting units subject to the 2007 annual impairment testing that are either the entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we did not test certain reporting units in 2007 as we determined we could carry forward the fair value of the reporting unit from the previous year.  

 20   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.  

 SFAS 142 specifies a two-step process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step. The second step is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.  

 The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using traditional valuation techniques such as the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earning and revenue multiples. These techniques use projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period. For example, our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.  

 Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1, 2007 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit at the low end of the valuation range. The following tables show the number of reporting units we tested in our 2007 and 2006 annual impairment reviews, together with the range of values we obtained for the excess of fair value over carrying value of each non-impaired reporting unit determined by using fair values for each unit (a) at the low end of our valuation range, (b) at the high end of our valuation range and (c) 10% below the low end of our valuation range.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Applying the hypothetical 10% decrease in 2007 to the fair values would result in 3 reporting units failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.  

 Pension and Postretirement Benefits  

 We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. These assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events. Changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions.  

 21   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 The discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impact our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations. Changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in long-term interest rates. A higher discount rate will decrease our pension cost. The discount rates are determined at the beginning of the year based on prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date and are adjusted to match the duration of the underlying obligation. For 2008, we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 5.89%, 5.33% and 6.00% for the domestic pension plans, foreign plans and the postretirement plan, respectively. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2007 net pension and postretirement cost by $2.4 and $2.5, respectively. In addition, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2007 benefit obligation by $22.5 and $23.8, respectively.  

 The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. For 2008, we plan to use weighted average expected rates of return of 8.15% and 7.02% for the domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. A lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2007 net pension cost by $1.0. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Consolidated Results of Operations  

 REVENUE  

 2007 Compared to 2006  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Our revenue increased by $363.4, which consisted of a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $197.5, net divestitures of $70.7 and organic revenue growth of $236.6. The change in revenues was negatively affected by net divestitures of non-strategic businesses, primarily at Draftfcb and Lowe, and a sports marketing business at the Constituency Management Group (CMG). This was partially offset by businesses acquired during 2007, primarily in the U.S. and India. The organic revenue growth was primarily driven by domestic markets through expanding business with existing clients, winning new clients in advertising and public relations and completing several projects within the events marketing business. The international organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases in spending by existing clients in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by net client losses in Continental Europe, primarily in France at the Integrated Agency Network (IAN).

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Revenue decreased due to net divestitures, partially offset by organic revenue increases and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Net divestitures primarily impacted IAN, largely from Draftfcb and McCann Worldgroup (McCann) during 2005. There were net organic revenue increases in both our international and domestic locations. The international organic increase was driven by higher revenue from existing clients, primarily in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by net client losses, primarily in 2005, at IAN as well as decreases in the events marketing businesses at CMG in the U.K. The domestic organic increase was primarily driven by growth in the public relations and branding businesses at CMG as well as higher revenue from existing clients, partially offset by net client losses and decreased client spending at IAN.  

 OPERATING EXPENSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Salaries and Related Expenses  

 Salaries and related expenses is the largest component of operating expenses and consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including cash bonus and long-term incentive stock awards, and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development, changes in the funding levels of employee performance incentives, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. Changes can occur in employee performance incentives based on  

 23   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 projected results and could affect trends between various periods in the future. In addition, long-term incentive stock awards may fluctuate as they are tied to our financial performance, generally for three-year periods beginning with the grant year, with the achievement of performance targets required for these awards. Our financial performance over the past few years has lagged behind that of our peers, primarily due to lower revenue and operating margin growth. As a result, salaries and related expenses reflect significant severance charges and investments in hiring creative talent to realign the business for revenue growth and improved operating margins. Also, salaries and related expenses reflect the hiring of additional finance professionals and information technology staff to upgrade system infrastructure and to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, as well as to develop shared services.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The following table details our salary and related expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Salaries and related expenses increased by $195.1, which consisted of a negative foreign currency rate impact of $122.2, net divestitures of $32.5 and an organic salary increase of $105.4. Net divestitures related primarily to the disposition of non-strategic businesses offset in part by acquisitions of businesses, primarily in the U.S. and India. The organic increase was primarily due to the following:  

       Base salaries, benefits and temporary help grew by $99.1, primarily to support business growth in IAN, predominantly at our largest network, McCann, and to support growth in the public relations businesses in CMG.   

       Cash bonus accruals and long-term incentive stock expense increased by $31.7, primarily due to improved operating performance versus financial targets at certain operating units, higher long-term incentive stock expense due to the effect of equity awards granted in June 2006 and a one-time performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the Company.    

 These increases were offset by a decrease in severance expense of $22.4 during 2007, primarily in IAN.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

 Salaries and related expenses decreased during 2006 due to net divestitures, primarily from the sale of several businesses at IAN during 2005, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an organic increase. Total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat as a result of the decline in revenue. Key factors behind the organic increase in salaries and related expenses from the prior year  

 24   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 were an increase in long-term incentive awards and bonus awards of $67.6 offset by a significant reduction in severance expense of $63.6. Expenses related to incentive awards increased in 2006 due to long-term equity based awards granted in June 2006 and the full year impact of awards granted in August 2005, while expenses related to bonus awards increased primarily due to performance.  

 Office and General Expenses  

 Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, expenses attributable to the support of client service professional staff, depreciation and amortization costs, bad debt expense relating to accounts receivable, the costs associated with the development of a shared services center and implementation costs associated with upgrading our information technology infrastructure. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements. These costs include out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service professional staff, production costs and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue. All other office and general expenses includes production expenses, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, foreign currency gains (losses) and other expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Office and general expenses decreased by $34.2, which consisted of a negative foreign currency rate impact of $66.0, net divestitures of $43.8 and an organic decrease of $56.4. Net divestitures related primarily to the disposition of non-strategic businesses offset in part by acquisitions of businesses, primarily in the U.S. and India. The organic decrease was primarily due to the following:  

       Improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes and internal controls resulted in a reduction in professional fees of $75.8. We expect professional fees to continue to decline in 2008.   

       Occupancy costs, including depreciation and amortization, declined by $13.6.    

 These decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of $34.2, primarily related to increased business at the events marketing business at CMG.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

 Office and general expenses for 2006 declined as a result of significant reductions in professional fees, which decreased by $93.7, primarily for projects related to our restatement activities and internal control compliance that occurred in 2005, lower production expenses, lower bad debt expenses and net divestitures, primarily due to the sale of several businesses at IAN during 2005. Partially offsetting this decrease were  

 25

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 higher rent expense and a reduction in foreign exchange gains on certain balance sheet items. The above items resulted in an organic decline which was primarily reflected at Corporate and IAN.  

 Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals)  

 The components of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges (reversals) were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Restructuring Charges (Reversals)  

 Restructuring charges (reversals) related to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at Lowe during the third quarter of 2007. Due to changes in the business environment that have occurred during the year, we committed to and began implementing a restructuring program to realign resources with our strategic business objectives within Lowe. This plan includes reducing and restructuring Lowes workforce both domestically and internationally, and terminating certain lease agreements. For this plan, we recognized charges related to severance and termination costs of $14.5 and expense related to lease termination and other exit costs of $4.6 during the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect to incur additional charges related to this program of approximately $4.0 in the first half of 2008. Cash payments are expected to be made through December 31, 2009.  

 Offsetting the severance and termination costs incurred at Lowe were adjustments to estimates relating to our prior severance and termination related actions. Offsetting the lease termination and other exit costs incurred at Lowe were reversals related to the utilization of previously vacated property by a Draftfcb agency and adjustments to estimates relating to our prior year plans.  

 During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 net lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to adjustments to managements estimates as a result of changes in sublease rental income assumptions and utilization of previously vacated properties relating to the 2003 program by certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets.  

 Other Reorganization-Related Charges  

 Other reorganization-related charges relate to strategic business decisions made during 2007 and 2006: our realignment of our media businesses and the 2006 merger of Draft Worldwide and Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create Draftfcb. Charges in 2007 and 2006 primarily related to severance and terminations costs and lease termination and other exit costs. We expect charges associated with the realignment of our media businesses in 2007 to be completed during 2008. Charges related to the creation of Draftfcb in 2006 are complete. The charges were separated from our operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations as they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business.

 Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges  

 Long-lived assets include furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements, goodwill and other intangible assets. Long-lived assets with finite lives are generally depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied fair value. No impairment charges were recorded for 2007.  

 The following table summarizes long-lived asset impairment and other charges in previous years:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2006  

 Our long-term projections, which were updated in the fourth quarter of 2006, showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due primarily to client losses at one of our domestic advertising reporting units. These discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $27.2.  

 2005  

 A triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual impairment test when a major client was lost by Lowes London agency and the possibility of losing other clients was considered a higher risk due to management defections and changes in the competitive landscape. This caused projected revenue growth to decline. As a result of these changes, our long-term projections showed declines in discounted future operating cash flows. These revised cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of Lowes goodwill was less than the related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit.  

 During our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The long-term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result, these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value.

 EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Net Interest Expense  

 The increase in net interest expense during 2007 is primarily attributable to higher cash interest expense on increased short-term debt, partially offset by increased interest income due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates at some of our international agencies. The change in non-cash amortization from the prior year was minimal. Non-cash amortization primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and deferred warrant costs from a transaction in 2006, which we refer to as the ELF Financing, in connection with entering into our current committed credit agreement, partially offset by reduced expense related to the amortization of the loss on extinguishment of $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 The increase in net interest expense during 2006 was primarily due to increases in non-cash amortization of $27.3, offset by interest income due to an increase in interest rates and higher average cash balances compared to the prior year. Non-cash amortization was primarily from the amortization of fees and deferred warrant costs incurred as a result of the ELF Financing transaction, prior year benefit from the amortization of gains on terminated swaps and the amortization of the remaining costs associated with our previous committed credit agreement. Additionally, the increase was due to one-time fees associated with the exchange of our Floating Rate Notes in 2006. The 2006 year-over-year comparison benefited from the fact that we did not incur waiver and consent fees similar to those incurred in 2005 for the amendment of the indentures governing our debt securities and our prior credit facility.

 For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Net (Losses) Gains on Sales of Businesses  

       2007  In the second quarter we sold several businesses within Draftfcb for a loss of $9.3 and in the third quarter incurred charges at Lowe of $7.8 as a result of the realization of cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of several businesses, as well as charges from the partial disposition of a business in South Africa.   

       2006  In connection with the 2005 sale of a European FCB agency, we released $11.1 into income primarily related to certain contingent liabilities that we retained subsequent to the sale, which were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2006.

 Vendor Discount and Credit Adjustments  

       We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits primarily established during the 2004 Restatement. Amounts included in other income (expense) reflect the reversal of certain liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed. For further information on vendor discounts and credits see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.    

 Net Gains on Sales of Available-for-Sale Securities and Miscellaneous Investment Income

       2006  In the second quarter, we had net gains of $20.9 related to the sale of an investment located in Asia Pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership interest in an agency within Lowe. In addition, during the third quarter, we sold our interest in a German advertising agency and recognized its remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance, which resulted in a non-cash benefit of $17.0.   

       2005  We had net gains of $8.3 related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership interest in an agency within FCB, and net gains on sales of certain available-for-sale securities of $7.9.

 For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Other Income  

       2007  Primarily includes dividend income from our cost investments.    

 INCOME TAXES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2007, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2007 by the release of tax reserves resulting from the effective settlement of the IRS examination for 2003-2004 and by the net reversal of valuation allowances. Certain tax law changes also impacted the effective tax rate, which resulted in the write-down of net deferred tax assets of $16.2, primarily in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, certain U.S. states.  

 The effective settlement of the IRS examination referred to above resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits, of which approximately $80.0 was attributable to certain worthless securities deductions. The favorable impact of this item and other net reserve releases are primary reasons for the change in the effective tax rate compared to 2006.  

 The tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic losses, foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances.  

 The tax provision for 2005 was primarily impacted by an increase in valuation allowances, a non-deductible asset impairment, state and local taxes and the resolution of various income tax audits and issues.  

 During 2007, we had a net reversal of valuation allowances of $49.0, of which $30.5 relates to the write-down of deferred tax assets due to tax law changes in jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances and $18.5 relates to reversals of valuation allowances in various countries where we believe that it is now more likely than not that the corresponding tax loss carryforwards will be utilized. During 2006 and 2005, we had net provisions for valuation allowances of $63.6 and $69.9, respectively, recorded in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets, current year tax losses and temporary differences. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $481.6, $504.0 and $501.0, respectively.  

 For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Segment Results of Operations  

 As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2007: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the Corporate and other group. As of

 INTEGRATED AGENCY NETWORKS (IAN)  

 REVENUE  

 2007 Compared to 2006  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The revenue increase in 2007 was a result of net changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue increases, partially offset by net divestitures. The domestic organic increase was a result of higher revenue from existing clients and net client wins, primarily at McCann and Hill Holliday. Partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was decreased revenue from existing clients at Lowe and net client losses at Draftfcb. The international organic increase was due to increases in client spending at McCann in the U.K. and Asia Pacific, partially offset by net client losses at Draftfcb and Lowe across most international regions. Net divestitures negatively affected revenue, due to the sale of non-strategic businesses in 2007 and 2006, primarily at Draftfcb and Lowe, partially offset by businesses acquired, primarily at Lowe.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The revenue decline in 2006 was a result of net divestitures, primarily from the sale of several businesses at Draftfcb and McCann in 2005, partially offset by an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic increase was driven primarily by McCann and Draftfcb, partially offset by decreases at Lowe and The Works, one of our independent agencies. The organic increase at McCann was the result of higher revenue from existing clients across domestic and international regions, primarily Asia Pacific and Latin America. McCanns increase was primarily driven by digital, direct and event marketing services. The increase at Draftfcb was primarily the result of increased spending from existing clients, partially offset by net client losses, primarily in 2005, across domestic and most international regions, primarily Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The decrease at Lowe was primarily due to reduced spending by existing clients and net client losses, primarily in domestic locations in 2005. The revenue decrease at The Works, a dedicated General Motors resource, was primarily due to the loss of the General Motors U.S. media buying business in 2005.

 SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Operating income increased due to an increase in revenue of $275.1, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $122.9 and office and general expenses of $15.4. Higher salaries and related expenses were primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $131.2 to support growth, primarily at McCann. The increase in office and general expenses was due to shared service expenses which were not allocated in prior years and the increased allocation of technology expenses from Corporate, partially offset by lower occupancy costs, primarily due to lease termination and other exit costs related to facilities exited in 2006.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

 Operating income increased during 2006 due to a decrease in office and general expenses of $139.7, a decrease in salaries and related expenses of $99.2, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $97.2. The reduction in office and general expenses primarily related to a decrease in production expenses of $46.4, a reduction in professional fees of $26.3 in connection with accounting projects, such as those related to our restatement activities, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $22.2. The reduction in salaries and related expenses primarily related to a reduction in severance expense of $63.1 for headcount reductions that occurred in international locations in 2005 and a decrease in salaries of $42.0.  

 CONSTITUENCY MANAGEMENT GROUP (CMG)  

 REVENUE  

 2007 Compared to 2006  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Revenue growth was a result of organic increases and net changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by net divestitures. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to client wins and expanding business with existing clients in the public relations business, the completion of several projects with existing clients in the events marketing business and expanding business with existing clients in the sports marketing business. Revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. Furthermore, we generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses. The international organic revenue increase was primarily from existing clients in the public relations business in Europe and the Asia Pacific Region. The international revenue increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from existing clients in Europe primarily due to project-based events in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 related to the sports marketing business. Net divestitures primarily relate to a sports marketing business sold in 2006.

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Revenue growth was a result of domestic organic revenue increases in the public relations and branding businesses, which was due to higher revenue from existing clients. Additionally, there were organic revenue increases domestically in the sports marketing and events marketing businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients and client wins. The domestic increase was partially offset by declines at some CMG agencies due to client losses. Internationally, the decline related primarily to a decrease in the events marketing and sports marketing businesses caused by client losses. The international decrease was partially offset by increases in the public relations and branding businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients.  

 SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Operating income increased primarily due to an increase in revenue of $88.3, partially offset by increases in office and general expenses of $46.1 and salaries and related expenses of $35.9. Salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries of $28.4 related to the hiring of additional staff in the public relations business to support revenue growth. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses of $32.0 related to the completion of several projects in the events marketing business and higher occupancy costs, primarily due to lease termination charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization related to certain leasehold improvements in facilities exited in 2007.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

 Operating income decreased slightly, primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and related expenses of $32.0, partially offset by a decrease in office and general expenses of $14.6 and an increase in revenue of $16.0. The increase in salaries and related expenses primarily related to an increase in base salaries expense of $22.3 and the decrease in office and general expenses primarily related to a decrease in production expenses of $19.8.  

 CORPORATE AND OTHER  

 Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income (loss) and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, bonus, and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily includes professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits, legal, information technology and other consulting services, which are  

 33   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition, office and general expenses also includes rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. Offsetting these expenses are amounts we allocate to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization.  

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Corporate and other expenses decreased by $59.4 to $215.9 for the year ended December 31, 2007. This was primarily driven by improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes and internal controls, which resulted in a reduction in professional fees. Partially offsetting this reduction were higher salaries and related expenses, primarily related to long-term incentive award accruals for a one-time performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the Company and the transfer of resources into a global finance organization as part of a regional monitoring program. In addition, amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the charging of shared services expenses that were not previously allocated as well as for costs relating to the consolidation of certain global processes into our shared service center.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  

 Corporate and other expenses decreased by $41.0 to $275.3 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Expenses decreased primarily due to reduced professional fees and higher amounts allocated to operating divisions, partially offset by higher rent, depreciation and amortization and increased salaries and related expenses. We incurred lower professional fees for accounting projects, which included those related to our prior-year restatement activities. Amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new information technology-related projects, the consolidation of information technology support staff, and the allocation of audit fees, which are now being allocated back to operating divisions. Higher rent, depreciation and amortization were due to software-related costs from our ongoing initiatives to consolidate and upgrade our financial systems, as well as to further develop our shared services. Salaries and related expenses increased due to higher headcount, primarily related to our technology initiatives, and for larger incentive compensation and bonus awards related to performance.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 CASH FLOW OVERVIEW  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $80.3 during 2007, primarily due to improved operating results and proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments, partially offset by  

 34   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 working capital usage, acquisitions, including deferred payments, and capital expenditures. Of this change, marketable securities increased by $21.1.  

 Operating Activities  

 Cash provided by operating activities of $298.1 reflects a significant improvement compared to both 2006 and 2005. The increase was primarily due to net income of $167.6, which includes net non-cash expense items of $316.1, partially offset by working capital usage of $171.0. Net non-cash expense items primarily include depreciation of fixed assets, the amortization of intangible assets, restricted stock awards, non-cash compensation, bond discounts and deferred financing costs, and deferred taxes.  

 During 2007 working capital improved to a use of working capital of $171.0 compared to the use of working capital of $250.6 during 2006. Working capital usage reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The working capital usage was impacted by the timing of certain vendor payments and cash collections from clients, the reversal, payment or settlement of various prior period liabilities that were established during the 2004 Restatement and the resolution of various tax matters. As we continue to strengthen our business operations we anticipate that working capital will improve.  

 The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, we collect funds from our clients that we use, on their behalf, to pay production costs and media costs. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. Generally, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients, and our risk from client nonpayment has historically not been significant.  

 In addition to the timing of accrued media and production, accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain payments. For example, while cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.  

 Investing Activities  

 Cash used in investing activities during 2007 primarily reflects acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sales of investments. Payments for acquisitions relate to purchases of agencies and deferred payments on prior acquisitions. During 2007, we made a number of acquisitions for total cash consideration of $140.4. Under the contractual terms of certain of our prior acquisitions we made cash payments of $17.5 for the year ended December 31, 2007. For additional information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures of $147.6 primarily related to costs associated with leasehold improvements and computer hardware.  

 Financing Activities  

 Cash used in financing activities during 2007 primarily reflects dividend payments of $27.6 on our Series B Preferred Stock and distributions to our minority interests.  

 LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  

 We expect our operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We believe that a conservative approach to liquidity is appropriate for our Company, in view of the cash requirements resulting from, among other things,  

 35   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 liabilities to our clients for vendor discounts and credits, any potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, the normal cash variability inherent in our operations, other unanticipated requirements and our funding requirements noted below. In addition, until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods.  

 A reduction in our liquidity in future periods could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. From time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance our financial flexibility. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  

 Funding Requirements  

 Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, payments related to vendor discounts and credits, debt service, preferred stock dividends, contributions to pension and postretirement plans, and taxes.  

       Acquisitions  We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and to increase our ownership interests in current investments, particularly to develop the digital and marketing services components of our business and to expand our presence in high-growth markets, including Brazil, Russia, India and China.   

       Payments related to vendor discounts and credits  Of the liabilities recognized as part of the 2004 Restatement, we estimate that we will pay approximately $65.0 related to vendor discounts and credits, internal investigations and international compensation arrangements over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2007 our liability balance was $184.6.   

       Debt Service  On March 15, 2008 holders of our $200.0 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 may require us to repurchase these Notes for cash at par. Based on current market conditions, we believe that most or all holders will require us to repurchase their Notes. The remainder of our debt profile is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled from 2009 to 2023.    

 Contractual Obligations  

 The following summarizes our estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)   Holders of our $200.0 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at par in March 2008 and as such, starting with the first quarter of 2007, we have included these Notes in short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.    

 36   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

     Holders of our $400.0 4.25% Notes may require us to repurchase their 4.25% Notes for cash at par in March 2012. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.  

  (2)   We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the potential risk associated with negative future performance of the acquired entity. All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn-out periods progress. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.   

 Regular quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock are $6.9, or $27.6 annually. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we made contributions of $30.1 to our foreign pension plans, but did not contribute to our domestic pension plans. For 2008, we do not expect to contribute to our domestic pension plans, and expect to contribute $24.7 to our foreign pension plans.  

 FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS  

 Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level, and to a lesser extent at our largest subsidiaries.  

 Since 2006, we have engaged in several transactions to improve our liquidity and debt maturity profile:  

       In November 2007, we exchanged $200.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. This transaction extended the first date on which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt from 2008 to 2013. It also extended the first date on which we can redeem this portion of our debt from 2009 to 2013.   

       In December 2006, we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate Notes due 2008 for the same aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2010. The new Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points, 125 basis points less than the interest rate on the old Floating Rate Notes.   

       In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. This transaction extended the first date on which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt from 2008 to 2012 and extended the second date on which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt from 2013 to 2015. It also extended the first date on which we can redeem this portion of our debt from 2009 to 2012.   

       In June 2006, we replaced our existing $500.0 Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, which would have expired in May 2007, with a new $750.0 Three-Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) as part of a capital markets transaction.    

 Credit Facilities  

 Under our principal credit facility, the Credit Agreement, a special-purpose entity called ELF Special Financing Ltd. (ELF) acts as the lender and letter of credit issuer. ELF is obligated at our request to make  

 37   
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations  (Continued)

 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 cash advances to us and to issue letters of credit for our account, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750.0 outstanding at any time. The aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed $600.0 at any time. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed may be repaid and borrowed again, and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase, subject to the overall limit of $750.0 and the $600.0 limit on letters of credit. We have not drawn on this facility to date or on our previous committed credit agreements since late 2003. We are not subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants under this facility. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 In addition to the Credit Agreement, we have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the U.S. There were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaling $95.9 and $80.3 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some overseas operations. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately 5%.  

 Letters of Credit  

 We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support our commitments, or those of our subsidiaries, to purchase media placements, mostly in locations outside the U.S., or to satisfy other obligations. These letters of credit are generally backed by letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit issued for our account under the Credit Agreement was $222.9 and $219.9 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These letters of credit have historically not been drawn upon.  

 Cash Pooling  

 We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the U.S., we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for each pooling arrangement. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 a gross amount of $1,295.7 and $1,052.5, respectively, in cash was netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under pooling arrangements.  

 DEBT RATINGS  

 Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 15, 2008 were Ba3 with stable outlook, B with positive outlook and BB- with stable outlook, as reported by Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

 OTHER MATTERS  

 SEC Investigation  

 Since January 2003 the SEC has been conducting a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in August 2002, and in 2005 the investigation expanded to encompass the 2004 Restatement. We have also responded to inquiries from the SEC staff (the Staff) concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but as settlement discussions have not yet commenced, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters.  

 The Staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from the Commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or, failing a settlement, to litigate an action charging the Company with various violations of the federal securities laws. In that connection, and as previously disclosed by the Company in a current report on Form 8-K filed June 14, 2007, the Staff sent the Company a Wells notice, which invited us to make a responsive submission before the Staff makes a final determination concerning its recommendation to the Commission. We expect to discuss settlement with the Staff once the Commission authorizes the Staff to engage in such discussions. We cannot at this time predict what the Commission will authorize or the outcome of any settlement negotiations.  

 2006 Out-of-Period Amounts  

 During 2006, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these adjustments resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of $6.1, a net favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of $5.6, a net unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of $6.5 and a net favorable impact to net loss of $4.5. The operating income impact of these adjustments primarily affected our IAN segment. Because these changes are not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2006, for the quarters of 2006 or for 2006 as a whole, we recorded these out-of-period amounts in their respective quarters of 2006. See also Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
