ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview  

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, UAL or the Company) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, United). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. Uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UALs revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UALs assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the Company in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.  

2016 Financial Highlights  

       2016 net income was $2.3 billion, or $6.85 diluted earnings per share.  

       Uniteds consolidated PRASM decreased 5.4% in 2016 compared to 2015.  

       Aircraft fuel cost decreased 23% year-over-year due mainly to lower fuel prices.  

       2016 CASM decreased 2.9% year-over-year on a consolidated capacity increase of 1.4%.  

       In 2016, UAL repurchased approximately 50 million shares of UAL common stock for $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.8 billion remaining to purchase shares under its share repurchase program.  

       UAL ended the year with $5.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which consisted of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available capacity under the revolving credit facility of the Companys Credit Agreement.  

2016 Operational Highlights  

       Consolidated RPMs for 2016 increased 0.8% as compared to 2015, and consolidated ASMs increased 1.4% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 82.9% in 2016 versus 83.4% in 2015.  

       For 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a DOT on-time arrival rate of 81.3% and 78.1%, respectively, and a system completion factor of 99.0% and 98.7%, respectively.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       The Company introduced new products to its industry-leading existing portfolio of products such as United Polaris service and announced Basic Economy fares which will expand its customers options.  

       During 2016, the Company reached new agreements with every domestic unionized work group.  

Outlook  

Set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical

Table of Contents 

 operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report and the factors described under Forward-Looking Information below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.  

The Company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2017. In order to continue improving operational performance in 2017, our top focus will be on further improvements in completion factor, departure performance and baggage handling.  

As outlined at our 2016 Investor Day presentation, the Company expects to drive significant incremental value by 2020 relative to 2015. United anticipates capturing this value through a variety of initiatives including a re-fleeting and upgauge program, additional customer choice through segmentation, improvements to the revenue management systems, ongoing sensible cost management, realizing our full network potential through improved schedule quality and enhancements to the MileagePlus program. In addition, the Company will continue to focus on improving reliability while increasing the efficiency of the operation.  

Economic Conditions. The economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2017 is characterized by moderate U.S. and global economic growth. In such conditions, we expect a moderate increase in the demand for air travel. Continuing economic uncertainty, along with the strengthening U.S. dollar, is providing uncertainty in key Asian, South American and European markets, and continued political and socioeconomic tensions may result in diminished demand for air travel.  

Capacity. In 2017, the Company expects consolidated ASMs to grow between 1% and 2% year-over-year.  

Fuel. The Companys average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $1.49 in 2016 as compared to $1.94 in 2015. Since 2014, the price of jet fuel has declined and remains volatile. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2017, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Companys annual fuel expense by approximately $95 million.  

Labor. As of December 31, 2016, United had approximately 80% of employees represented by unions. In 2016, United reached contract extensions with its pilots and dispatchers, amended collective bargaining agreements with its IAM represented employees, reached a five-year contract with the AFA covering all of its flight attendants and reached a six-year contract with the IBT covering its technicians and related employees. Additionally, the Company will be increasing pay for its pilots in order to align with a recently implemented contract of another airline. The costs associated with all these agreements is expected to add approximately $900 million of costs for full-year 2017. The Company cannot predict the outcome of future negotiations with its unionized employee groups. Increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have a material financial impact on the Company.  

Results of Operations  

In this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) See Part II,

 Item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.  

Consolidated passenger revenue decreased $1.3 billion, or 4.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Consolidated PRASM decreased 5.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decline in PRASM was driven by factors including a competitive domestic fare environment, lower surcharges, a strong U.S. dollar and reductions from energy-related corporate travel.  

Cargo revenue decreased $61 million, or 6.5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to lower freight yields and lower mail volumes year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in freight volumes. Freight yields were negatively impacted as air freighter competitors increased capacity in response to lower fuel prices. Another contributing factor to the year-over-year decrease was a U.S. West Coast port labor dispute that resulted in an increase in air freight results in the first quarter of 2015. The labor dispute was resolved during the first quarter of 2015.

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to the Companys operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related costs increased $562 million, or 5.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher pay rates and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 2.2% increase in average full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a reduction in profit sharing expense in 2016 as compared to 2015, a reduction in medical and dental costs and the results of certain costs savings initiatives in 2016.  

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices and a reduction in fuel hedge losses, partially offset by the impact of a 1.4% increase in capacity. 2016 fuel expense includes the benefit of a $20 million fuel tax refund. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Depreciation and amortization increased $158 million, or 8.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to additions of new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to capital leases, aircraft improvements, accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types and increases in information technology assets.  

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $98 million, or 5.9%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a year-over-year increase in airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits and volume-driven increases in component costs, partially offset by a reduction in costs due to the timing of maintenance on certain engines.  

Aircraft rent decreased $74 million, or 9.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.

See Note 16 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.  

Other operating expenses increased $343 million, or 6.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in ground handling costs, food and technology costs associated with the Companys enhanced customer experience initiatives, rate-driven increases in hotel expenses for crews, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 Summer Olympics and volume-driven increases in cargo costs.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Companys nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $55 million, or 8.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt issuances in 2015 and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft, the conversion of certain operating leases to capital leases and certain constructed airport assets accounted for as capital leases.  

In 2015, Miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. Foreign currency losses were approximately $43 million and $129 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign currency results included $8 million and $61 million of foreign exchange losses for 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the Companys cash holdings in Venezuela. Miscellaneous, net for 2015 also includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 6% Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes) and the 6% Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes).

 (a) See Part II, Item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.  

Consolidated passenger revenue in 2015 decreased $977 million, or 2.9%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in consolidated yield of 4.3% year-over-year. Yields were impacted by a competitive domestic fare environment, unfavorable foreign currency results due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, international surcharge declines, travel reductions from corporate customers in the energy sector and increased industry capacity in certain regions. The decline in yields was partially offset by a 1.5% year-over-year increase in traffic.

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to the Companys operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related costs increased $778 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a $463 million increase in profit sharing costs as a result of improved profitability, higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements, an increase in medical and dental costs and an increase in pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions.  

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 1.6% increase in capacity. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Depreciation and amortization increased $140 million, or 8.3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to additions in owned property and equipment, specifically related to new aircraft, information technology assets and several aircraft capital lease conversions from operating leases.  

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased $128 million, or 7.2%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a year-over-year decrease in significant airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits, improvements in the efficiency of in-house maintenance programs, a reduced volume of seat and landing gear maintenance and a reduction of flying hours under certain power-by-the-hour engine maintenance agreements, partially offset by increases in expenses related to aircraft reliability projects and Wi-Fi systems maintenance.  

Aircraft rent decreased $129 million or 14.6% in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $66 million, or 9.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt issuances and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft.  

Miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million and $462 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign currency losses were approximately $129 million and $41 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign currency results included $61 million and $10 million of foreign exchange losses for 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the Companys cash holdings in Venezuela. Miscellaneous, net for 2015 includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes. 2014 Miscellaneous, net includes a $64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the $248 million 6% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2030.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $4.4 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of $0.8 billion from December 31, 2015. The Company had its entire commitment capacity of $1.35 billion under the Credit Agreement available for letters of credit or borrowings as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $124 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for letters of credit and estimated future workers compensation claims. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations. Restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 totaled $206 million.  

We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. At December 31, 2016, the Company had  

35  

Table of Contents 

 approximately $11.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.0 billion that are due within the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. As of December 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $5.0 billion. However, approximately $5.9 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not actual cash outlays. The deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations. The Company made principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling $1.4 billion in 2016.  

The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and related interest.  

For 2017, the Company expects between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion of gross capital expenditures. See Notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.  

As of December 31, 2016, a substantial portion of the Companys assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. See Note 11 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.  

The following is a discussion of the Companys sources and uses of cash from 2014 through 2016.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

2016 compared to 2015  

Cash flow provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.5 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the same period in 2015. Working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by $0.5 billion year-over-year in 2016 as compared to 2015. The following were significant working capital items in 2016:  

       Frequent flyer and advance purchase of miles decreased $0.6 billion due to increased utilization of pre-purchased miles.  

       Other assets, including spare parts, increased by $0.3 billion as part of the Companys efforts to improve fleet reliability.  

       Accounts payable increased $0.2 billion, driven by the timing of payments.  

2015 compared to 2014  

Cash flow provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.0 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the same period in 2014. The $3.4 billion increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $3.1 billion in income before income taxes and a $0.4 billion increase in non-cash items for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by $0.1 billion year-over-year in 2015 as compared to 2014. The following were significant working capital items in 2015:  

       Cash flow increased by $0.2 billion from the return of hedge collateral net of the impact of changes in fuel derivative positions.  

       Other liabilities, including accrued wages, decreased $0.2 billion, which included $0.8 billion in pension contributions offset by $0.7 billion in profit sharing accruals.  

       Frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles decreased $0.2 billion.

These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Below is a summary of additional liquidity matters. See the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Contractual Obligations. The Companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.  

The table below provides a summary of the Companys material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in billions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Long-term debt presented in the Companys financial statements is net of $124 million of debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs which are being amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs.  

 (b) Includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $67 million in 2017, $57 million in 2018, $50 million in 2019, $47 million in 2020, $44 million in 2021 and $339 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.

 (c) Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our CPAs and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. Amounts also exclude a portion of Uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its CPAs. See Note 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.  

 (d) Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2026. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.  

 (e) Represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for Uniteds material pension plans. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies, below, for a discussion of our current year assumptions regarding Uniteds pension plans.  

 (f) Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft, spare engines and other capital purchase commitments. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. The Companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in Contractual Obligations, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.  

As of December 31, 2016, United had cash collateralized $72 million of letters of credit. United also had $383 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at December 31, 2016. Most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021.  

As of December 31, 2016, United is the guarantor of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases. The leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. The annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above.  

As of December 31, 2016, United is the guarantor of $168 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of Uniteds regional carriers.

Increased Cost Provisions. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the Companys debt.  

Fuel Consortia. United participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient

As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December 31, 2016, the Companys contingent exposure was approximately $234 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2017 to 2049. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.
