EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro or the Company) is a worldwide leader in branded entertainment and play for children and families. With a consumer focus, Hasbro applies its brand blueprint to its broad portfolio of properties. The brand blueprint revolves around the objectives of continuously re-imagining, re-inventing, and re-igniting the Companys existing brands, imagining, inventing and igniting new brands, and offering consumers the ability to experience the Companys brands in all areas of their lives.  

To accomplish these objectives, the Company offers consumers the ability to experience its branded play through innovative toys and games, digital media, lifestyle licensing and publishing and entertainment, including television programming and motion pictures. The Companys focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights, offering entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the Companys brands across multiple forms and formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to increase operating margins and maintain a strong balance sheet.  

The Company earns revenue and generates cash primarily through the sale of a broad variety of toy and game products and distribution of television programming based on the Companys properties, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with complementary products, including digital media and games and lifestyle products, offered by third-parties. The Companys core brands represent Company-owned brands or brands which if not entirely owned, are broadly controlled by the Company, and which have been successful over the long term. The Companys core brands include TRANSFORMERS, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, FURREAL FRIENDS, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, PLAYSKOOL, MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS and G.I. JOE. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new forms and formats over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2011 the Company had strong revenues from core brands such as TRANSFORMERS, NERF, FURREAL FRIENDS, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAY-DOH, and PLAYSKOOL.  

The Companys innovative product offerings encompass a broad variety of toys including boys action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls toys, electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive products, creative play and toy-related specialty products. Games offerings include board, card, electronic, trading card, role-playing and DVD games.  

While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths and allow the Company to offer innovative products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties. The Companys primary licenses include its agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (Marvel) for characters in the Marvel universe, including IRON MAN and SPIDER-MAN; Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (Lucas), related to the STAR WARS brand; and Sesame Workshop, related to the SESAME STREET

 characters. The third quarter of 2011 commenced the first period of significant sales under the Companys license with Sesame Workshop. In 2011, the Company had sales of MARVEL products, including sales of products related to the Marvel movie releases of THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER. In 2010, the Company had significant sales of products related to the Marvel movie release of IRON MAN 2. During 2012 the Company will market products related to two expected theatrical motion picture releases based on MARVEL properties, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS. In addition, in the second half of 2010 the Company re-introduced BEYBLADE products, another licensed entertainment property. The Company has had significant sales of BEYBLADE products in 2011 as well as the second half of 2010. In addition to offering products based on licensed entertainment properties, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors.  

The Company also seeks to build immersive brand experiences and drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment such as motion pictures and television programming. Since 2007, the Company has had three motion pictures based on its TRANSFORMERS brand and one motion picture based on its G.I JOE brand released by major motion picture studios. This includes the release of the third TRANSFORMERS motion picture, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON, in 2011. The Company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. The next motion pictures based on the Companys properties are BATTLESHIP, which is scheduled to be released in 2012 by Universal Pictures, and G.I. JOE: RETALIATION, which is scheduled to be released in 2012 by Paramount Pictures. The Company has motion picture projects based on other brands in development for potential release in future years.  

In addition to using motion pictures to provide entertainment experiences for its brands, the Company established Hasbro Studios, an internal wholly-owned production studio, in 2009. Hasbro Studios is responsible for the creation and development of television programming based primarily on Hasbros brands. This programming is currently aired throughout the world. The Company is a 50% partner in a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. (Discovery) which runs THE HUB, a cable television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming. Programming on THE HUB includes content based on Hasbros brands, Discoverys library of childrens educational programming, as well as programming developed by third parties. Hasbro Studios programming is distributed in the U.S. exclusively to THE HUB while programming internationally is distributed to leading childrens networks around the world. The Companys television initiatives support its strategy of growing its core brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format.  

The Companys strategic blueprint also focuses on extending its brands further into digital media and gaming, including through the licensing of the Companys properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games based on those brands. An example of these digital gaming relationships is the Companys agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), which provides EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject to existing limitations on the Companys rights and certain other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on a number of the Companys intellectual properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA and LITTLEST PET SHOP. Similarly, the Company has an agreement with Activision under which Activision offers digital games based on the TRANSFORMERS brand. The Company continues to seek and develop additional outlets for its brands in digital gaming, including casual, mobile and online gaming.  

In recent years the Company has expanded its lifestyle licensing business, and this remains a key area of focus for future development and growth. Under its lifestyle licensing programs, the Company enters into relationships with a broad spectrum of apparel, food, bedding and other lifestyle products companies for the global marketing and distribution of licensed products based on the Companys brands. These relationships further broaden and amplify the consumers ability to experience the Companys brands.  

As the Company seeks to grow its business in entertainment, licensing and digital gaming, the Company will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms and formats.

During 2011, the Company established Hasbros Gaming Center for Excellence in Rhode Island to centralize games marketing and development while building on Hasbros strategy of re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting core brands as well as inventing new brands.  

The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the second half of the year accounted for 63%, 65% and 65% of the Companys net revenues, respectively.  

The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. In recent years, the Companys international net revenues have experienced growth as the Company has sought to increase its international presence. One of the ways the Company has driven international growth is by opportunistically opening offices in certain markets to develop a greater presence. Since 2006, the Company has opened up operations in eight new markets around the world including China, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Romania, Czech Republic, Peru and Colombia. These represent emerging markets where the Company believes that it can achieve higher revenue growth than it could achieve in more mature markets. Net revenues of the Companys International segment represented 43%, 39% and 36% of total net revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

The Companys business is separated into three principal business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the U.S. and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South American toy and game marketing and sales operations. The Companys Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Companys lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and online entertainment operations. In addition to these three primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment.  

The Company is committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, from 2005 through 2011, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) adopted six successive share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $2,825,000. The sixth authorization was approved in May 2011 for $500,000. At December 25, 2011, the Company had $227,269 remaining available under this authorization. During the three years ended 2011, the Company spent a total of $1,150,683, to repurchase 29,395 shares in the open market. The Company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions, the Companys other potential uses of cash and the Companys levels of cash generation. In addition to the share repurchase program, the Company also seeks to return excess cash through the payment of quarterly dividends. In February 2012 the Companys Board increased the Companys quarterly dividend rate, effective for the dividend payment in May 2012, to $0.36 per share, a 20% increase from the prior quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. This was the sixth dividend increase since 2005. Since then the Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 300%, from $0.09 to $0.36 per share.

Results of Operations  

Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2011 were fifty-two week periods.  

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2011 were $385,367, or $2.82 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2010 and 2009 of $397,752 and $374,930, or $2.74 and $2.48 per diluted share, respectively.  

Net earnings for both 2011 and 2010 include a $0.15 per diluted share favorable tax benefit resulting from the settlement of tax examinations. Net earnings for 2011 also include a $0.07 per diluted share unfavorable impact resulting from costs associated with a reorganization of its games business announced during the second quarter of 2011 related to the establishment of the Gaming Center of Excellence.  

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 were $4,285,589 compared to $4,002,161 in 2010 and $4,067,947 in 2009. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2011 were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $64,300 as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar in 2011 as compared to 2010. In 2010 consolidated net revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $17,700 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2010 as compared to 2009.

The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for 2011, 2010 and 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

U.S. and Canada  

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 decreased 2% to $2,253,458 from $2,299,547 in 2010. In 2011, net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $4,700. The decrease in net revenues in 2011 was due to decreased revenues in the girls toys and games and puzzles categories. The decrease in the girls category was primarily the result of decreased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS partially offset by increased sales of BABY ALIVE and MY LITTLE PONY. The decrease in the games and puzzles category was due to decreased sales of traditional board games and puzzles partially offset by increased sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING products. Decreases in the girls toys and games and puzzles categories were partially offset by increased sales in the boys toys and preschool categories. Increases in boys toys sales were significantly impacted by the first full year of sales of BEYBLADE products after its reintroduction in the second half of 2010. Higher sales of TRANSFORMERS, which benefited from the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON, as well as sales of KRE-O products, which were introduced during the second half of 2011, also contributed to increased sales in the boys toys category. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of NERF products, and to a lesser extent, STAR WARS and TONKA product lines. The preschool category benefited from the introduction of several new products under the Companys license with Sesame Workshop as well as increased sales of TRANSFORMERS and STAR WARS products specifically designed for younger consumers. Increased net revenues in the preschool category were partially offset by decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL, TONKA, and PLAY-DOH products, which had stronger sales during 2010.  

U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $278,356, or 12.4% of net revenues, in 2011 from $349,594, or 15.2% of net revenues in 2010. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on U.S. and Canada operating profit in 2011. Operating profit was negatively impacted by the decline in net revenues. In addition, higher sales of licensed properties, such as BEYBLADE and movie-related TRANSFORMERS products, resulted in higher royalty expense in 2011. The decline in operating margin was largely due to the lower revenue base in 2011; product mix, including lower revenues from board games and higher revenues from entertainment-based products; and the impact of closeout sales.  

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 decreased 6% to $2,299,547 from $2,447,943 in 2009. The decrease in net revenues in 2010 was primarily due to decreased revenues in the boys toys category, primarily as a result of decreased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products. The 2009 sales of these lines benefited from the theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN in June 2009 and G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA in August 2009. Boys toys sales were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of STAR WARS products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of NERF products as well as increased sales of MARVEL products, which benefited from the theatrical release of IRON MAN 2 in May 2010. Boys toys sales were also positively impacted by the reintroduction of BEYBLADE products in the second half of 2010. Net revenues in the games and puzzles  

30  

Table of Contents 

 category also decreased in 2010 due to decreased sales of traditional board games and puzzles in the U.S. late in the year. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games. Sales in the girls category were flat in 2010. Increased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS products and, to a lesser extent, BABY ALIVE products were offset by decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP products. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP products decreased in 2010, sales of these products remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues. Net revenues in the preschool category increased in 2010 as the result of stronger sales of PLAY-DOH, TONKA and PLAYSKOOL products.  

U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $349,594 in 2010 from $380,580 in 2009. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on U.S. and Canada operating profit in 2010. The decrease in U.S. and Canada operating profit was primarily driven by the decreased revenues in 2010 discussed above and, to a lesser extent, higher cost of sales as a percentage of those revenues due to a change in the mix of products sold. These decreases were partially offset by decreased royalty and amortization expense in 2010.  

International  

International segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 increased by 19% to $1,861,901 from $1,559,927 in 2010. In 2011, net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $59,300 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment net revenues increased 16% in local currency in 2011. Revenues increased in 2011 in all major geographic regions as part of our ongoing strategy to achieve growth in the International segment. Net revenues in both Europe and Latin America / Mexico each increased 19% in 2011 compared to 2010, while Asia Pacific net revenues increased 24% in 2011 compared to 2010. The increased International segment net revenues were driven by increased sales in the boys toys category. The increase in the boys toys category was primarily due to the first full year of sales related to BEYBLADE products, which were reintroduced in 2010 as well as higher sales of TRANSFORMERS, NERF, KRE-O and SUPER SOAKER products. Sales of TRANSFORMERS and KRE-O products benefited from the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON during 2011. Increased sales in the boys toys category were slightly offset by decreased sales in the preschool, girls toys, and games and puzzles categories. Decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL and TONKA products in the preschool category were partially offset by sales of SESAME STREET products. The decrease in net revenues in the girls toys category is primarily due to decreased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products, which were partially offset by increased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS and BABY ALIVE products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased slightly as a result of lower sales of board games, partially offset by increased sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING products.  

International segment operating profit increased 29% to $270,578, or 14.5% of net revenues, in 2011 from $209,704, or 13.4% of net revenues, in 2010. Operating profit for the International segment in 2011 was positively impacted by approximately $4,400 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the increased net revenues described above. This was partially offset by higher royalty expense as a result of increased revenues from higher royalty-bearing products, particularly BEYBLADE and movie-related TRANSFORMERS products. The increase in operating profit margin was largely due to the impact of the increased net revenues.  

International segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 increased by 7% to $1,559,927 from $1,459,476 in 2009. In 2010, net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $27,600 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment net revenues increased 9% in local currency in 2010. The increased net revenues in 2010 were driven by increased sales in all categories as well as growth in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia and China. The increase in the boys toys category was primarily due to higher sales of NERF products as well as the reintroduction of BEYBLADE products in 2010. Increased sales of MARVEL and TONKA products also contributed to the increased sales in the boys toys category. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE lines. The increase in net revenues in the girls toys category was primarily driven by increased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS products partially offset by lower sales of MY  

31  

Table of Contents 

 LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP products. Preschool category net revenues increased primarily as the result of stronger sales of PLAY-DOH and PLAYSKOOL products offset by decreased sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category increased slightly as a result of increased revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games.  

International segment operating profit increased 29% to $209,704 in 2010 from $162,159 in 2009. Operating profit for the International segment in 2010 was negatively impacted by approximately $11,500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the increased revenues described above. In addition, operating profit was positively impacted by decreased royalty expense and amortization. These were offset by increased selling, distribution and administration expenses.  

Entertainment and Licensing  

The Entertainment and Licensing segments net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 increased 19% to $162,233 from $136,488 for the year ended December 26, 2010. The increase was primarily due to growth in television programming and lifestyle licensing revenues. The increased television programming revenues reflect a full year of U.S. and international program distribution in 2011 compared to a partial period in 2010, as program distribution primarily commenced during the third quarter of 2010. Higher lifestyle licensing revenues primarily related to TRANSFORMERS, as a result of licensing programs based on the motion picture release in 2011.  

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit decreased 1% to $42,784 in 2011 from $43,234 in 2010. The impact of higher net revenues was offset by investments made by the Company to grow its global licensing organization and increased program production cost amortization.  

The Entertainment and Licensing segments net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 decreased 12% to $136,488 from $155,013 for the year ended December 27, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in both lifestyle and digital gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to lower licensing revenues from TRANSFORMERS and, to a lesser extent, G.I. JOE, products following the motion picture releases in 2009.  

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit decreased 34% to $43,234 in 2010 from $65,572 in 2009. Operating profit decreased as a result of the decreased revenues discussed above and program production amortization costs associated with our television shows. This was partially offset by lower selling, distribution and administration expenses. Selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2009 included approximately $7,200 in transaction costs related to the Companys investment in THE HUB.  

While THE HUB is a component of our television operations, the Companys 50% share in the earnings from the joint venture is included in other (income) expense and therefore is not a component of operating profit of the segment.  

Expenses  

The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 25, 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

Cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. Cost of sales increased to 42.8% of net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 from 42.2% in 2010. The negative impacts of lower sales of traditional board games as well as increased close-out inventory shipments in 2011 were only partially offset by the positive impact of increased sales of entertainment-based properties, such as TRANSFORMERS and BEYBLADE products, and sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING products. In addition, cost of sales was negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances as a result of reduced games production in 2011. While cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of entertainment-based products are generally lower than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products, including Company owned or controlled brands based on a movie release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the benefit of these lower cost of sales. Additionally, costs of sales as a percentage of net revenues of traditional board games and puzzles are generally lower. Cost of sales increased to 42.2% of net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2010 from 41.2% in 2009. The increase was partially due to a change in the mix of revenues. Increased cost of sales as a percentage of revenues reflects a change in product mix primarily due to decreased sales of entertainment-based products in 2010 compared to 2009.  

Royalty expense increased to $339,217 or 7.9% of net revenues in 2011 compared to $248,570, or 6.2% of net revenues, in 2010 and $330,651, or 8.1% of net revenues, in 2009. The increase in 2011 and the decrease in 2010 primarily reflect the higher sales of entertainment-driven products in 2011, primarily BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS products, and 2009, namely TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products.  

Product development expense in 2011 totaled $197,638, or 4.6% of net revenues, compared to $201,358, or 5.0% of net revenues, in 2010 and $181,195, or 4.5% of net revenues, in 2009. Product development expense for 2011 includes approximately $6,800 related to the reorganization of the games business. Excluding the impact of the games reorganization, the lower 2011 expense reflects the Companys focus on leveraging its development efforts on larger, global brands. The increased expense in 2010 reflects higher costs associated with the development of products introduced in 2011, including products related to the Companys agreement with Sesame Workshop.  

Advertising expense in 2011 totaled $413,951, or 9.7% of net revenues, compared to $420,651, or 10.5% of net revenues, in 2010 and $412,580, or 10.1% of net revenues, in 2009. Lower advertising expense in 2011 and 2009 reflects the increased volume in sales of entertainment-based properties, primarily TRANSFORMERS and BEYBLADE products in 2011 and TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products in 2009, which do not require the same level of advertising that the Company spends on non-entertainment based products. In addition, the increase in 2010 reflects a lower revenue base due to the decline in U.S. sales late in the year as well as increased advertising rates in 2010.  

Amortization of intangibles decreased to $46,647, or 1.1% of net revenues, in 2011 compared to $50,405, or 1.3% of net revenues, in 2010. The decrease in 2011 is the result of certain properties becoming fully amortized during 2010. Amortization expense decreased to $50,405 or 1.3% of net revenues in 2010 compared to $85,029 or 2.1% of net revenues in 2009. The decrease in 2010 is the result of property rights related to Wizards of the Coast becoming fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

Program production cost amortization increased to $35,798 or 0.8% of net revenues in 2011 compared to $22,069 or 0.6% of net revenues in 2010. Program production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. The Company did not begin amortizing program production costs until the third quarter of 2010, upon the initial distribution of its television programming. Accordingly, the increase in 2011 primarily reflects four quarters of activity whereas the comparable period of 2010 includes two quarters of activity.  

Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars, however decreased as a percentage of revenues in 2011 compared to 2010. These expenses were $822,094, or 19.2% of net revenues, compared to $781,192, or 19.5% of net revenues, in 2010. The 2011 amount includes approximately $7,600 of costs related to the reorganization of Companys games business. The remaining increase primarily reflects increased shipping costs related to higher revenues as well as increased expenses from the Companys investments in emerging markets, on-line operations, licensing, entertainment and its internal systems. These increases were partially

 offset by lower stock compensation and bonus provisions in 2011 due to the Companys underperformance in relation to its financial targets. Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to $781,192 or 19.5% of net revenues in 2010, compared $793,558 or 19.5% of net revenues in 2009. The 2009 amount includes approximately $7,200 of transaction costs related to the Companys purchase of a 50% interest in THE HUB. The remaining decrease relates to lower management incentive and other compensation expenses in 2010 partially offset by higher marketing and sales costs related to emerging markets and television initiatives.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense increased to $89,022 in 2011 from $82,112 in 2010 and $61,603 in 2009. The increases in both 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2010 and 2009, respectively. In March 2010, the Company issued $500,000 of long-term debt which bears interest at a rate of 6.35%. The impact on interest expense of this issuance was partially offset by the conversion and redemption of the contingent convertible debentures during March and April 2010, which bore interest at the rate of 2.75%. In May 2009, the Company issued $425,000 of long-term debt which bears interest at a rate of 6.125%. A portion of these proceeds were used to purchase a 50% interest in THE HUB. The 2009 interest expense amount includes approximately $4,000 in costs related to a short-term borrowing facility commitment the Company entered into in April 2009 in connection with the Companys anticipated investment in THE HUB.  

Interest Income  

Interest income was $6,834 in 2011 compared to $5,649 in 2010. The increase primarily reflects interest received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to prior years. Interest income was $5,649 in 2010 compared to $2,858 in 2009. The increase primarily reflects higher invested cash balances during 2010.  

Other (Income) Expense, Net  

Other (income) expense, net of $25,400 in 2011 compares to $3,676 in 2010 and $156 in 2009. The increase in other (income) expense, net in 2011 is primarily due to losses on foreign currency transactions and investment losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010. Further, the 2010 amount includes a gain of $(4,950) on the sale of a product line.  

Foreign currency exchange losses of $8,343 in 2011 compared to foreign currency exchange gains of $(725) in 2010. The loss in 2011 includes $3,700 related to derivative instruments which no longer qualified for hedge accounting. Investment losses of $4,617 in 2011 compared to investment gains of $(3,822) in 2010, primarily reflecting the decrease in value of warrants to purchase common stock of an unrelated company. Other (income) expense, net in 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes $7,290, $9,323 and $(3,856) respectively, relating to the Companys 50% share in the loss (earnings) of THE HUB.  

Income Taxes  

Income tax expense totaled 20.8% of pretax earnings in 2011 compared with 21.7% in 2010 and 29.2% in 2009. Income tax expense for 2011 is net of a benefit of approximately $29,600 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations or expirations of statutes in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Income tax expense for 2010 is net of a benefit of approximately $22,300 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Income tax expense for 2009 is net of a benefit of approximately $2,300 related to discrete tax events, primarily related to the expiration of state statutes and settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Absent these items and potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in 2011, 2010 and 2009, the effective tax rates would have been 26.2%, 25.4% and 29.0%, respectively. The decrease in the adjusted tax rate in 2011 and 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to higher earnings from international operations in jurisdictions that have lower income tax rates than the U.S.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2011, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program. During 2012, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. In the event that the Company is not able to issue commercial paper, the Company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2012, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although the Company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the Company.  

As of December 25, 2011 the Companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $641,688, substantially all of which is held outside of the U.S. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the Company. Such international cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company decided to repatriate such funds. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund U.S. cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. If the Companys assessment of indefinite reinvestment of international earnings changes, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the U.S. and the applicable tax jurisdiction of the international subsidiaries. If the Company repatriated the funds from its international subsidiaries, it would then be required to pay the additional U.S. income tax. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. as of December 25, 2011 is denominated in the U.S. dollar.  

At December 25, 2011, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $461,258 compared to $713,228 and $621,932 at December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, respectively. Hasbro generated $396,069, $367,981 and $265,623 of cash from its operating activities in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2011, 2010 and 2009 included $80,983, $52,047 and $1,837, respectively, of cash used for television program production. In 2012, the Company expects cash expenditures related to television program production to be in the range of $70,000 to $80,000. Cash from operations in 2011, 2010 and 2009 also includes long-term royalty advance payments of $25,000 made to THE HUB in each of the three years. Operating cash flows in 2009 were also negatively impacted by the Companys decision to sell $250,000 of its accounts receivable under its securitization program at December 28, 2008. The securitization program was not utilized at year end 2009 or in 2010, and was terminated in January 2011.  

Accounts receivable, net increased to $1,034,580 at December 25, 2011 from $961,252 at December 26, 2010. The accounts receivable balance at December 25, 2011 includes a decrease of approximately $24,900 as a result of the translation of foreign currency. Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the increase in accounts receivable reflects increased sales and timing of such sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Days sales outstanding increased to 70 days at December 25, 2011 from 68 days at December 26, 2010. Accounts receivable decreased to $961,252 at December 26, 2010 from $1,038,802 at December 27, 2009. The accounts receivable balance at December 26, 2010 includes a decrease of approximately $11,500 as a result of the translation of foreign currency balances. Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the decrease in accounts receivable reflects decreased sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.  

Inventories decreased to $333,993 at December 25, 2011 compared to $364,194 at December 26, 2010. The decreased inventory balance at December 25, 2011 reflects higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2010 as well as the Companys efforts to lower its overall levels from year-end 2010. Inventories increased to  

35  

Table of Contents 

 $364,194 at December 26, 2010 compared to $207,895 at December 27, 2009. The increased inventory balance at December 26, 2010 reflects the lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009.  

Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $243,431 at December 25, 2011 from $167,807 at December 26, 2010 primarily due to higher non-income based tax receivables. These tax receivables are primarily related to value added taxes in Europe that are due to the Company, primarily from France, Spain and Germany, which are expected to be collected in 2012. The increase is primarily due to changes in the legal structure of the Companys European business, which have resulted in larger outstanding balances at year-end 2011. This increase was partially offset by decreases in foreign exchange contracts and income tax receivables. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased slightly to $167,807 at December 26, 2010 from $162,290 at December 27, 2009. Increases in income tax receivables, current deferred income taxes and the values of the Companys forward currency contracts were partially offset by decreased prepaid royalties as the result of utilization of advance royalty payments.  

Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $761,914 at December 25, 2011 compared $704,233 at December 26, 2010. The 2011 balance includes a decrease of approximately $15,100 as a result of the translation of foreign currency balances. Increases in accrued expenses relate to higher accrued royalties as a result of increased sales of royalty-bearing BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS products in 2011. The remainder of the increase relates to higher accrued costs associated with cancelled purchase commitments and accrued income and other taxes. These increases were partially offset by lower accrued payroll and management incentives. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $704,233 at December 26, 2010 compared to $801,775 at December 27, 2009. The decrease primarily related to lower accrued payroll and management incentives, lower accrued royalties as a result of the decrease in entertainment-driven products, and lower accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments in 2010.  

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $107,615, $104,188, and $497,509 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additions to property, plant and equipment were approximately $99,400, $113,000 and $104,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these amounts, 66% in 2011, 57% in 2010 and 58% in 2009 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2012, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $125,000 to $135,000. During the three years ended December 25, 2011, the depreciation of plant and equipment was $113,821, $95,925 and $95,934, respectively. Cash utilized for investments and acquisitions were $11,585 in 2011, $0 in 2010, and $371,482 in 2009. The 2011 utilization includes the Companys purchase of intellectual property. The 2009 utilization includes the Companys $300,000 payment to Discovery for its 50% interest in THE HUB, a payment of $45,000 to Lucas to extend the term of the license agreement related to the STAR WARS brand and approximately $26,500 used to acquire certain other intellectual properties. There were no investments or acquisitions in 2010.  

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. During 2011, the Company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit. In 2010 and 2009, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available lines of credit and, during a portion of 2009, its accounts receivable securitization program to fund its operations.  

During 2010 and 2009, the Company was party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sold, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF was consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allowed HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it held to certain bank conduits. The program provided the Company with a source of working capital. In January 2011, the Company terminated this program.

In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of banks to establish a commercial paper program (the Program). Under the Program, at the request of the Company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the Company, or arrange for the sale by the Company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. The Company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $500,000. The maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. Borrowings under the Program are supported by the Companys $500,000 revolving credit agreement. At December 25, 2011, the Company had notes outstanding with par value of approximately $166,500 related to the Program.  

The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides it with a $500,000 committed borrowing facility through December of 2014. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2011. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 25, 2011. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of December 25, 2011 were approximately $1,200 and borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program were approximately $166,500. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 25, 2011 were approximately $332,300. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $36,000 was utilized at December 25, 2011. Of the amount utilized under, or supported by, the uncommitted lines, approximately $14,000 and $22,100 represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.  

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $375,685 in 2011. Of this amount, $423,008 reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2011, the Company repurchased 10,461 shares at an average price of $40.42. At December 25, 2011, $227,269 remained under the May 2011 Board authorization. Dividends paid were $154,028 in 2011 compared to $133,048 in 2010 reflecting the increase in the Companys dividend rate in 2011 to $0.30 per quarter from $0.25 per quarter. These utilizations were partially offset by proceeds of $167,339 from short-term borrowings in 2011. In addition, cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2011 was $29,798.  

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $170,595 in 2010. Of this amount, $639,563 reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2010, the Company repurchased 15,763 shares at an average price of $40.37. Dividends paid were $133,048 in 2010 compared to $111,458 in 2009 reflecting the increase in the Companys dividend rate in 2010 to $0.25 per quarter from $0.20 per quarter. These utilizations were partially offset by proceeds of $492,528 from the issuance of long-term notes in March 2010. In addition, cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2010 was $93,522.  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $236,779 in 2009. Of this amount, $421,309 reflected net proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes in May 2009. Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2009 was $9,193. These sources of cash were partially offset by $88,112, which included transaction costs, used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2009, the Company repurchased 3,172 shares at an average price per share of $28.67. Dividends paid were $111,458 in 2009.  

For the $425,000 in notes due in 2014 and the $350,000 in notes due in 2017 which bear interest at 6.125% and 6.30%, respectively, interest rates may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+, respectively, or below. At December 25, 2011, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB+ and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.

Including the notes described above, the Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 25, 2011 of approximately $1,384,895 due at varying times from 2014 through 2040. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately $174,082 and purchase commitments of $344,370 outstanding at December 25, 2011. Letters of credit and similar instruments include $150,840 related to the defense of tax assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $40,314 in 2012.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates  

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.  

Sales Allowances  

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to license fees and royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.  

For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2011, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates made in prior years.  

Program Production Costs  

The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the Companys toy and game brands, including animated and live-action programs and game shows. These costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.  

The most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. Ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations. Ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy, game and other merchandise licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as DVD distribution. Our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. We review  

38  

Table of Contents 

 and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. Prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. Factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the U.S. which are distributed on THE HUB, our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.  

For the year ended December 25, 2011 we have $80,600 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3-year period 2012 through 2014. The Company estimates program production cost amortization in 2012 to be in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, which includes amortization related to amounts capitalized during 2011 as well as amortization of amounts expected to be incurred for programs to be completed and released in 2012. Future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues. During 2011 the Company did not incur any impairment charges related to its program production costs.  

Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value. No reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test. Accordingly, no impairment was indicated. The Companys annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 25, 2011, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $550,530 recorded on the balance sheet.  

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an  

39  

Table of Contents 

 appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $391,555 at December 25, 2011. During 2011, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.  

Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

The Companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 25, 2011, the Company had $134,730 of prepaid royalties, $16,788 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $117,942 of which are included in other assets.  

Pension Costs and Obligations  

Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. The estimates for the Companys U.S. plans are established at the Companys measurement date. The Company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.  

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2011 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 7.25%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2011 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $655.  

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Companys discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2011 pension expense averaged 5.20%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2011 pension expense and the 2011 projected benefit obligation by approximately $465 and $11,554, respectively.  

Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 25, 2011, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $104,872 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $87,553 at December 26, 2010. The increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2011, primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to value the liability at December 25, 2011 as well as differences between the Companys actual return on plan assets and the expected return assumed in the calculation of the 2011 expense. The discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at December 25, 2011 decreased to 4.96% at December 25, 2011 from 5.20% used at December 26, 2010. Pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.

Income Taxes  

The Companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the Companys quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2011 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2011, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately $29,600 related to discrete tax events, primarily related to the completion of a U.S. tax examination.  

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Companys income tax return. The Mexican government has a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax. Should the Company be subject to the alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based tax in 2012, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive earnings either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive earnings as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity. The pronouncement does not change the current option for presenting components of other comprehensive earnings, gross or net of the effect of income taxes, provided that such effects are presented in the statement in which other comprehensive earnings are presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Additionally, the pronouncement does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share. The pronouncement also does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive earnings, how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net earnings. This standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application is permitted. Hasbro expects its adoption will have no effect on its financial position or results of operations but it will impact the way Hasbro presents comprehensive earnings.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,384,895 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 25, 2011. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 25, 2011 are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company has a liability at December 25, 2011, including potential interest and penalties, of $97,661 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.  

In connection with the Companys agreement to form a joint venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.  

The Companys agreement with Marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. In connection with the extension of the Marvel license in 2009, the Company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling $140,000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next seven years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases.  

Purchase commitments represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business. The reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2011.  

In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $5,800 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International pension plans in 2012. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $174,082 at December 25, 2011.  

The Company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations described above.  

Financial Risk Management  

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British Pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $43,451 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions.  

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.  

The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 25, 2011, these contracts had unrealized gains of $7,891, of which $7,778 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $2,021 are recorded in other assets, $(783) are recorded in accrued liabilities, and $(1,125) are recorded in other liabilities. Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December 25, 2011 are deferred gains of $10,081, net of tax, related to these derivatives.  

At December 25, 2011, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $1,384,895. The Company is party to several interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $400,000, to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long-term debt. At December 25, 2011, the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $15,977, which is included in other assets, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase long-term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately $126,700 or $107,400, respectively. A hypothetical one-quarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2011 pretax earnings by $885 and 2011 cash flows by $767.  

The Economy and Inflation  

The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 45% of its consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 50% and 54% of its consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2011, approximately 63% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. The Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys future revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.  

The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2011 was not significant and the Company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

Other Information  

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
