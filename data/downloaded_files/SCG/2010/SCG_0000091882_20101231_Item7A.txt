ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

 All financial instruments held by the Company described below are held for purposes other than trading.  

 Interest Rate Risk 

 The tables below provides information about long-term debt issued by the Company and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and related maturities. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices. Interest rate swap agreements are valued using discounted cash flow models with independently sourced data.

 While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur.  

 The above tables exclude long-term debt of $21 million at December 31, 2010 and $34 million at December 31, 2009, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them.

Table of Contents 

 SCE&G and PSNC Energy utilize futures, options and swaps to hedge gas purchasing activities. SCE&G's tariffs include a PGA clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The SCPSC has ruled that the results of SCE&G's hedging activities are to be included in the PGA. As such, costs of related derivatives utilized by SCE&G to hedge gas purchasing activities are recoverable through weighted average cost of gas calculations. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is deferred. PSNC Energy's tariffs also include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy defers premiums, transaction fees, margin requirements and any realized gains or losses from its hedging program for subsequent recovery from customers.
