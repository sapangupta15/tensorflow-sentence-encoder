PART I  

Item 1. Business.  

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 Nordstrom incorporated in the state of Washington in 1946 as the successor to a retail shoe business that started in 1901. We are one of the nations leading fashion specialty retailers, with 171 U.S. stores located in 28 states as of March 20, 2009. The west coast and east coast are the areas in which we have the largest presence. Nordstrom is comprised of four segments: Retail Stores, Direct, Credit, and Other.  

Retail Stores derives its revenues from sales of high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. It includes our 109 Nordstrom full-line stores, 58 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores, two clearance stores that operate under the name Last Chance, and two Jeffrey boutiques. The Nordstrom Rack stores purchase merchandise directly from manufacturers and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from our full-line stores.  

In 2008, we opened eight full-line stores (Aventura, Florida; Honolulu, Hawaii; Burlington, Massachusetts; Clinton Township, Michigan; Thousand Oaks, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Naples, Florida), relocated one full-line store (Tacoma, Washington) and opened six Rack stores (White Plains, New York; Laguna Hills, California; Naperville, Illinois; Lyndhurst, Ohio; Danvers, Massachusetts; and San Antonio, Texas). To date in 2009, we have relocated one full-line store (Murray, Utah) and opened two new Rack stores (Paramus, New Jersey and Dallas, Texas). During the remainder of 2009, we are scheduled to open three full-line stores (Cherry Hill, New Jersey; Peabody, Massachusetts; and Cincinnati, Ohio) and open eight additional Rack stores (Sandy, Utah; Orland Park, Illinois; East Palo Alto, California; Los Angeles, California; Southlake, Texas; Orlando, Florida; Pasadena, California; and Cincinnati, Ohio). In 2010, we are scheduled to open three full-line stores, relocate one full-line store and open four Rack stores.  

Direct generates revenues from sales of high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories by serving our customers on the Internet at www.nordstrom.com and through our catalogs. The Direct segments sales are primarily shipped via third-party carriers from our fulfillment center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  

Through our wholly owned federal savings bank, Nordstrom fsb, we offer a private label card, two Nordstrom VISA credit cards and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. The credit and debit cards feature a shopping-based loyalty program designed to increase customer visits and spending in our Retail Stores and Direct segments. Our Credit segment generates income through finance charges and other fees on these cards.  

Our Other segment includes our product development team, called Nordstrom Product Group, which designs and contracts to manufacture private label merchandise sold in our Retail Stores and Direct. In addition, this segment includes our corporate center operations. During the time that we owned it, this segment also included the operations of our Façonnable business.  

For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

 and Results of Operations on page 15 and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  

FISCAL YEAR END

TRADEMARKS

 We have approximately 139 registered trademarks or trademark applications. Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, John W. Nordstrom, Caslon, and Classiques Entier. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely provided that it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.  

RETURN POLICY

 We offer our customers a fair and liberal return policy at our full-line stores and Nordstrom Direct (online and catalog). Our Nordstrom Rack stores accept returns up to 30 days from the date of purchase. In general, our return policy is somewhat more generous than industry standards. We utilize historical return patterns to estimate our expected returns.  

SEASONALITY

 Due to our Anniversary Sale in July and the holidays in December, historically, sales are higher for our Retail Stores and Direct in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year than in the first and third quarters.  

INVENTORY

 We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with the selling patterns that we expect. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which extends over the last two weeks of July. Also, we purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through early January). We pay for our merchandise purchases under the terms established with our vendors.  

4  
In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of high-quality suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. Our suppliers include domestic and foreign businesses. We expect our suppliers to meet our Nordstrom Partnership: Standards and Business Practice Guidelines, which address our standards for matters such as law, labor, health and safety, and environment.  

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

 Our business is highly competitive. Each of our stores competes with other national, regional and local retail establishments that may carry similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, specialty stores, boutiques and Internet businesses. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the principal methods of competing in our industry include customer service, fashion, quality of product, depth of selection, store environment and location.  

EMPLOYEES

 During 2008, we regularly employed on a full- or part-time basis approximately 51,000 employees. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 54,000 employees in July 2008 and 52,000 in December 2008.
