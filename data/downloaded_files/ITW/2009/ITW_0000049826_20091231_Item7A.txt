 Foreign Currency Risk  

 The Company operates in the United States and 56 other countries. In general, the Companys products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. The initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the U.S. parent company. Therefore, the Company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. As such, the Company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at December 31, 2009 or 2008.  

 In October 2007, the Company issued 750.0 million of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014. The Company has significant operations with the Euro as their functional currency. The Company believes that the Euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes.
