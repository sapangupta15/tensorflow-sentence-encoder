Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  

Business Overview  

We are the worlds largest provider of enterprise software and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services. Our software, hardware systems, and services businesses develop, manufacture, market, host and support database and middleware software, applications software, and hardware systems, with the latter consisting primarily of computer server and storage products. Our businesses provide products and services that are built upon industry standards, are engineered to work together or independently within existing customer information technology (IT) environments and run securely on a wide range of customer IT environments, including cloud computing environments.  

Cloud computing environments provide on demand access to a shared pool of computing resources in a scalable, self-service manner, delivering advantages in speed, agility and efficiency. Cloud computing has evolved from technologies and services that Oracle has provided for many years, including clustering, server virtualization, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), shared services, large-scale management automation, and more recently, engineered systems. Our secure, reliable and scalable product offerings are designed to improve business efficiencies at a low total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the product offering categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets.  

We believe our ability to offer our customers choice and flexibility in the manner in which they deploy our products and serviceswhile maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security and interoperability based upon industry-standardsis important to our corporate strategy. Oracle Fusion Applications, for example, offer customers a choice of deployment models to run our standards-based software applications in on-premise or cloud computing IT environments. Oracle Cloud, a family of our cloud-based software subscription offerings, provides access to select Oracle software applications and software platforms on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment. Oracle Cloud includes software applications as a service, such as Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management Cloud Service and Oracle Fusion Customer Relationship Management Cloud Service, and software platform services such as Oracle Database Cloud Service and Oracle Java Cloud Service, among others.  

We believe our internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. In each of fiscal 2012 and 2011, we invested $4.5 billion and in fiscal 2010 we invested $3.3 billion in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We continue to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability, and security to our customers. For example, Oracle Engineered Systems, which include our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, and SPARC SuperCluster products, amongst others, combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to provide engineered systems that increase computing performance and reduce storage requirements relative to our competitors products, creating time savings, efficiencies, and operational cost advantages for our customers.  

We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.

We are organized into three businessessoftware, hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments. Prior to our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) in January 2010, we did not have a hardware systems business or related operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows.  

Software Business  

Our software business, which represented 70%, 68% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts and due to our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development.  

New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software and provide subscription-based access to select Oracle software applications and software platforms through a cloud-based IT environment to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business. New software license revenues represented 27%, 26% and 28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The proportion of our new software license revenues relative to our total revenues was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our new software license segments margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new software license segments margins have been and will continue to be affected by fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscription obligations that we assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired.  

We recorded adjustments to reduce obligations under our assumed cloud software subscription offerings in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud software subscription revenues as a part of our new software licenses revenues that would have been otherwise recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $22 million in fiscal 2012. To the extent underlying cloud software subscription contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the cloud software subscription contracts over the contract periods.  

Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts, (2) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection  

39  

Table of Contents 

 with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired.  

Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 43%, 42% and 49% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. The proportion of our software license updates and product support revenues relative to our total revenues was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Margins during fiscal 2012 were 87% and accounted for 72% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons:  

       substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal;  

       substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new software license revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our support contract base; and  

       our acquisitions have increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.  

We recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year.  

Hardware Systems Business  

Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 17%, 19% and 9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services.  

Hardware Systems Products: We provide a complete selection of hardware systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including public and private cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud infrastructures. Our hardware systems products consist primarily of computer server, storage and hardware-related software, including our Oracle Solaris operating system. Our hardware systems component products are designed to be open, or to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems.  

40  

Table of Contents 

Our Oracle Engineered Systems include Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine, SPARC SuperCluster, Oracle Database Appliance and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. By combining our server and storage hardware with our software, our open, integrated products better address customer on-premise and cloud computing requirements for performance, scalability, reliability, security, ease of management and lower total cost of ownership.  

We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers are differentiated by their reliability, security, scalability and customer environments that they target (general purpose or specialized systems). Our midsize and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale.  

We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are primarily based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are also compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems.  

Our Netra line of servers are aimed at the unique needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and network equipment providers. Rack-optimized systems and our blade product offerings combine high-density hardware architecture and system management software that OEMs find particularly useful in building their own solution architectures.  

Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments.  

The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers.  

To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly, test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we rely on third party manufacturing partners. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a build-to-order manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. In addition, we seek to enhance hardware systems support processes that are designed to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of new hardware products.  

Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and operating margins that we report are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets.  

We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report.  

Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a  

41  

Table of Contents 

 number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts. All of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.  

Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the support periods.  

Services Business  

Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting services, managed cloud services and education services. Our services business, which represented 13% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, has lower margins than our software and hardware businesses. The proportion of our services revenues relative to our total revenues was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, personnel reductions in our customers IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues.  

Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products with which they relate and are performed after the customers purchase of the products. Our services revenues as they relate to consulting services are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of our product revenues, in particular the new software license sales of our application products. To the extent we are able to grow our products revenues, in particular our software application product revenues, we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues.  

Oracle managed cloud services provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance servicesincluding deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade servicesfor customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers, or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. We believe that our managed cloud services offerings provide our customers with greater value and choice through increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and services.  

Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware products by our customers and create opportunities to grow our products revenues.  

Acquisitions  

An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Taleo Corporation (Taleo) and RightNow Technologies, Inc (RightNow) in fiscal 2012,  

42  

Table of Contents 

 and Art Technology Group, Inc. (ATG) and Phase Forward Incorporated (Phase Forward) in fiscal 2011, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions.  

We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:  

       Revenue Recognition  

       Business Combinations  

       Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments  

       Accounting for Income Taxes  

       Legal and Other Contingencies  

       Stock-Based Compensation  

       Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  

In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Revenue Recognition  

Our sources of revenues include: (1) software, which includes new software license revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products and fees from cloud software subscription offerings, and software license updates and product support revenues; (2) hardware systems, which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers and storage products, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which includes software and hardware related services including consulting, managed cloud services and education revenues. Revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements)  

New software license revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  

For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  

Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  

The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  

Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element ArrangementsSoftware Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)  

We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOEdescribed further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license.  

Revenue Recognition for Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Related Services and Cloud Software Subscription Offerings (Nonsoftware Elements)  

Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers and storage products. Our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables and  

44  

Table of Contents 

 other nonsoftware deliverables including hardware systems related services and cloud software subscription offerings is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products, hardware systems related services revenues and cloud software subscription revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  

Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  

Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year.  

Our cloud software subscription offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud software subscription offerings are recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  

Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element ArrangementsHardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements)  

We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  

For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and, if  

45  

Table of Contents 

 so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions.  

When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e. distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices.  

Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements  

Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements  

We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products, hardware systems support, new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud software subscription, consulting, managed cloud services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above.  

Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements  

Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e. consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully  

46  

Table of Contents 

 burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  

Our managed cloud services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services. Oracle managed cloud services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from managed cloud services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.  

Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  

If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software license revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements.  

We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the essential use of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity.  

We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.  

While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts

 from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.  

In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  

Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenues or hardware systems product revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations.  

Business Combinations  

We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.  

Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  

Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to:  

       future expected cash flows from software license sales, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents;  

       expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;  

       the acquired companys brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and  

       discount rates.  

Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

Table of Contents 

We estimate the fair values of cloud software subscription, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize new software licenses revenues related to cloud software subscription contracts in the amount of $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2012. We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscription and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud software subscription, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the contracts periods, which are generally one year in duration.  

In connection with a business combination, we estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination. These costs are accounted for as one-time termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.  

For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.  

If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  

In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value, whichever comes first,

 changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  

Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments  

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. Effective fiscal 2012, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments identified in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2011 or 2010.  

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.  

Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.  

Accounting for Income Taxes  

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we  

50  

Table of Contents 

 believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.  

Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate.  

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.  

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.  

The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.  

In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities.

Legal and Other Contingencies  

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock-based awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years.  

We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate.  

We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary.  

We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense.  

52  

Table of Contents 

To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded options, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods.  

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  

We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data that we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected.  

Results of Operations  

Impact of Acquisitions  

The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Taleo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, RightNow in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, ATG in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and Phase Forward during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.  

The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, our acquisitions of ATG in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and Phase Forward during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.  

In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, we quantify the contributions of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues, software license updates and product support revenues, hardware systems products revenues (as applicable) and hardware systems support revenues (as applicable) for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date. We also are able to quantify the total incremental expenses associated with our hardware systems products and hardware systems support operating segments for fiscal 2011 in comparison to fiscal 2010. The incremental contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.  

We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons:  

       the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and  

       although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscription contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as software license updates and product support deferred revenues, new software licenses deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew.

Constant Currency Presentation  

Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2011, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.25 million in fiscal 2012 (using 1.25 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.41 million in fiscal 2011 (using 1.41 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2012 results using the fiscal 2011 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.  

Total Revenues and Operating Expenses

 (1)   Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa  

 (2)   Asia Pacific includes Japan  

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in our total revenues in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to growth in our software business revenues, partially offset by a reduction in our hardware systems business revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65%, EMEA contributed 8% and Asia Pacific contributed 27% to our total revenues growth.  

54  

Table of Contents 

Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased slightly in fiscal 2012 primarily due to a reduction in our hardware systems business expenses due to efficiencies gained through our hardware systems support integration efforts and lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues; due to decreases in certain variable compensation expenses; and due to a reduction in restructuring costs and acquisition related costs primarily associated with expenses incurred in fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of Sun. These fiscal 2012 expense decreases were partially offset by fiscal 2012 expense increases in salaries and benefits primarily related to additional sales and marketing headcount and an increase in general and administrative expenses that was due to a $120 million legal expense recovery in fiscal 2011.  

Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2012 was due to our increase in revenues while our expenses decreased.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Our total revenues increased in fiscal 2011 due to $4.7 billion of incremental revenue contribution from our hardware systems business and significant increases in our software and services businesses revenues. Our total revenues growth across all of our businesses in fiscal 2011 was favorably affected by a full year of revenue contributions from Sun as compared to our fiscal 2010 operating results, for which Suns revenue contributions were limited to only a portion of the fiscal 2010 period. In addition, our software business revenues increased as a result of the growth in our new software license revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 29% and APAC contributed 16% to our total revenues growth.  

Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 was due to a full year of expense contributions from Sun to our fiscal 2011 operating results, including increased expenses pertaining to hardware systems products sold and related hardware systems support offerings, additional employee related expenses and an increase in intangible asset amortization. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in restructuring expenses relating to our Sun Restructuring Plan and certain other Oracle-based restructuring plans and were also favorably affected by the recovery of certain legal costs in fiscal 2011 as noted above.  

On a constant currency basis, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2011 due to our total revenues growth. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2011 as our revenues and expenses grew at approximately the same rates.  

Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges  

To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information.

Our operating results include the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense items:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscription, software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize new software licenses revenues related to cloud software subscription contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amount of $22 million in fiscal 2012. We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.  

Approximately $34 million of estimated cloud software subscription contract revenues assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2013 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $13 million and $2 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2013 and 2014, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $11 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2013 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the contract renewal periods.  

 (2)   Represents the effects of fair value adjustments to our inventories acquired from Sun that were sold to customers in fiscal 2010. Business combination accounting rules require us to account for inventories assumed from our acquisitions at their fair values. The $29 million included in the hardware systems products expenses line in the table above for fiscal 2010, is intended to adjust these expenses to the hardware systems products expenses that would have been otherwise recorded by Sun as an independent entity upon the sale of these inventories. If we acquire inventories in future acquisitions, we will be required to assess their fair values, which may result in fair value adjustments to those inventories.  

 (3)   Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2012, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (4)   Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and certain other operating expenses, net.

 (5)   The significant majority of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 relate to employee severance, facility exit costs and contract termination costs in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2010 primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to our Sun Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  

 (6)   Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.  

 (7)   The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 24.0% for fiscal 2012 instead of 23.0%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the disproportionate rate impact of discrete items, income tax effects related to acquired tax exposures, and differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 25.3% for fiscal 2011 instead of 25.1%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to differences in jurisdictional tax rates and the related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period and the income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.1% for fiscal 2010 instead of 25.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to similar reasons as those noted for the fiscal 2011 differences.  

Software Business  

Our software business consists of our new software licenses segment and software license updates and product support segment.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software license revenues increased by 8% in fiscal 2012 due to growth across all major regions and product types and due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 63%, EMEA contributed 13% and Asia Pacific contributed 24% to our new software license revenues growth during fiscal 2012.  

In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 6% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2012 primarily due to growth resulting from improved customer demand for our products, our sales forces execution and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The growth rates of our new software license revenues for fiscal 2012 were affected by the high growth rates that we experienced in fiscal 2011 against which our fiscal 2012 revenues were compared. In reported currency, products from our recent acquisitions contributed $63 million to the growth in our database and middleware revenues and $254 million to the growth in our applications revenues during fiscal 2012.

Table of Contents 

As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud software subscription obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud software subscription revenues in the amount of $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2012. To the extent underlying cloud software subscription contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the cloud software subscription contracts over the contract periods.  

In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 4% in fiscal 2012 and represented 27% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2012 in comparison to 28% in fiscal 2011.  

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total new software license expenses increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount.  

Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, new software license margin increased due to the increase in revenues, and new software license margin as a percentage of revenues was flat as our revenues increased at the same rate as our operating expenses.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software license revenues increased by 19% in fiscal 2011 due to growth across all major regions and product types and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 63%, EMEA contributed 21% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to our new software license revenues growth during fiscal 2011.  

In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 19% and 20%, respectively, in fiscal 2011 primarily due to similar reasons as those noted above. In reported currency, Sun contributed $398 million in growth to our database and middleware revenues through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Sun) and our other recent acquisitions contributed $40 million during fiscal 2011. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $191 million to the growth in our applications revenues during fiscal 2011.  

In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 47% in fiscal 2011 and represented 28% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2011 in comparison to 23% in fiscal 2010.  

Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher employee related and other operating expenses resulting from a full year of expense contributions from Sun to our fiscal 2011 operating results and higher variable compensation expenses resulting from higher revenues.  

Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our revenues increased at a faster rate than our expenses.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2012 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all customers electing to purchase support contracts during the trailing 4-quarter period, the renewal of substantially all of the customer base eligible for renewal in the current fiscal year and incremental revenues from recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 18% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues.  

In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2012 included incremental revenues of $83 million from our recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration.  

Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses were flat in fiscal 2012 as an increase in intangible asset amortization and salaries expenses from increased headcount were offset by reductions in variable compensation expenses, bad debt expenses and certain other operating expenses.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2011 for similar reasons as those noted above.  

In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2011 included incremental revenues of $240 million from Sun through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (the one year anniversary of our acquisition) and $80 million from our other recently acquired companies. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were affected by business combination accounting rules.  

On a constant currency basis, total software license updates and product support expenses increased due to an increase in salaries, variable compensation and benefits expenses that were primarily related to a full years contribution from Sun and certain other headcount increases.  

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses.  

Hardware Systems Business  

Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment.  

Hardware Systems Products: Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server and storage products. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems products revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 due to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our legacy product lines, including lower margin products, and due to the recent introduction of new SPARC processor-based servers that we believe slowed purchases of predecessor server products. These hardware revenue decreases were partially offset by increases in hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems during fiscal 2012.  

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products operating expenses declined in fiscal 2012 primarily due to reductions in hardware systems products costs associated with lower revenues, lower intangible asset amortization, and decreases in bad debt expenses, which were partially offset by increased employee related expenses due to additional sales headcount.  

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreases in hardware systems products revenues and increases in hardware sales and marketing expenses.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: The increases in hardware systems products revenues, expenses and total margin for fiscal 2011 were primarily attributable to the impact of Suns contributions to our operating results for the full fiscal 2011 year as compared to fiscal 2010, which included Suns contribution to our operating results for only a portion of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2010, our hardware systems products expenses and total margin were unfavorably impacted by $29 million of fair value adjustments made pursuant to business combination accounting rules for inventories we assumed from Sun and sold to customers in the post-combination periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses.  

Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware systems and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems support revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 due to revenue decreases in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by higher revenues in the Americas.  

As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million that would have been otherwise reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods.  

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the reduction of service delivery costs during fiscal 2012 resulting from our integration initiatives associated with our acquisition of Sun.

Amortization of Intangible Assets:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Not meaningful  

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 was flat as additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired from our acquisitions of RightNow and Taleo in fiscal 2012 and from our acquisitions of ATG and Phase Forward in fiscal 2011, amongst others, were offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal 2011 in comparison to fiscal 2010 due to additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired including our acquisitions of ATG and Phase Forward in fiscal 2011 and our acquisition of Sun in fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.  

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and certain other operating expenses, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: On a constant currency basis, the decrease in acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower transitional employee related costs and professional services expenses in comparison to those that were incurred in fiscal 2011 (primarily related to our acquisition of Sun), and was also due to a benefit from a business combination related legal settlement, which reduced our fiscal 2012 expenses. These expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses associated with our recent acquisitions and expenses associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).

Table of Contents 

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased primarily due to the full fiscal year impact of Suns expense contributions, including higher transitional employee related expenses.  

Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 primarily related to our Sun Restructuring Plan, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to better align our cost structure as a result of our acquisition of Sun. To a lesser extent, we also incurred expenses associated with other Oracle-based plans, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our Oracle-based operations. The decrease in restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 in comparison to those that were incurred in fiscal 2011 primarily related to the decrease in expenses incurred in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: During fiscal 2011, we incurred restructuring expenses primarily in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan and to a lesser extent, we also incurred expenses associated with other Oracle-based plans. During fiscal 2010, we recorded restructuring expenses primarily in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan.  

Interest Expense:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2012 due to lower average borrowings as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the maturity and repayment of $2.25 billion of senior notes in January 2011.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2011 due to higher average borrowings resulting primarily from our issuance of $3.25 billion of senior notes in July 2010. This interest expense increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the maturities and repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes, as noted above, and $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and related variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements in May 2010.  

Non-Operating Income (Expense), net: Non-operating income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses) including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

67  

Table of Contents 

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of net foreign currency transaction losses incurred in fiscal 2012 in comparison to net foreign currency transaction gains incurred in fiscal 2011. In addition, we incurred a decrease in other income, net, which was attributable to net gains recorded in fiscal 2011 due to favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that we classify as trading that are held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. These unfavorable variations to non-operating income, net were partially offset by increases in interest income during fiscal 2012 due to larger average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in comparison to fiscal 2011.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: We recorded non-operating income, net during fiscal 2011 in comparison to non-operating expense, net in fiscal 2010 primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses incurred in fiscal 2010, which included a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $81 million resulting from the designation of our Venezuelan subsidiary as highly inflationary in accordance with the FASBs ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, and the subsequent devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by the Venezuelan government. In addition, our interest income increased in fiscal 2011 due to larger average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and other income, net increased in fiscal 2011 as a result of gains recognized on the sale of certain equity investments.  

Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Provision for income taxes increased during fiscal 2012 due substantially to higher income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by the favorable effects of an increase in the number of foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower statutory rates than the United States, the earnings of which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If these subsidiaries generate sufficient earnings in the future, our provision for income taxes may continue to be favorably affected to a meaningful extent, although any such favorable effects could be significantly reduced under a variety of circumstances.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Provision for income taxes increased during fiscal 2011 due substantially to higher income before provision for income taxes and a reduction in the impact of favorable judicial decisions and settlements with worldwide taxing authorities.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our stock repurchases during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 (we used $5.9 billion of cash for stock repurchases during fiscal 2012 in comparison to $1.2 billion used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2011), the reclassification of $1.25 billion of our senior notes due April 2013 as a

Table of Contents 

 current liability, cash used for acquisitions and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. These decreases to working capital were almost entirely offset by the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2012. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are variable.  

The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2011 in comparison to May 31, 2010 was primarily due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2011 and our issuance of $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2010. These increases were partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders.  

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities and our short-term borrowing of $1.7 billion made pursuant to a revolving credit agreement. These increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by our June 2011 repayment of $1.15 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our expired revolving credit facilities, $255 million of cash used to repay RightNows legacy convertible notes after the closing of the acquisition, the use of $4.7 billion of net cash for acquisitions, the repurchases of our common stock (see discussion above) and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $26.8 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2012, $20.9 billion of which we consider indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $6.3 billion as of May 31, 2012. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against major international currencies during fiscal 2012, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased as of May 31, 2012 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates as of May 31, 2011.  

The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2011 in comparison to May 31, 2010 was primarily due to cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $3.25 billion of senior notes in July 2010 and $1.15 billion of short-term borrowings made pursuant to certain of our revolving credit agreements. Additionally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2011. These increases in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were partially offset by the repayment of $2.25 billion of our senior notes which matured in January 2011, the repayment of $881 million of commercial paper notes, the usage of $1.9 billion of net cash for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and the payments of cash dividends to our stockholders.  

Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 53 days at May 31, 2012 compared with 55 days at May 31, 2011. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the revenue adjustments that primarily reduce our acquired cloud software subscription, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value.

Table of Contents 

Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales, sales of hardware systems products and hardware systems support arrangements and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased facilities.  

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation, an increase in cash from the collection of trade receivables, an increase in cash received that relates to our deferred revenue balances, a decrease in cash used to pay income tax obligations and certain other net cash favorable working capital movements, in each case compared to fiscal 2011. These cash favorable movements were partially offset by an increase in cash used to pay compensation liabilities in fiscal 2012 such as commissions and bonuses in comparison to fiscal 2011.  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation. These fiscal 2011 increases were partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital, primarily increases in net trade receivables resulting from increases in revenues during our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 in comparison to fiscal 2010.  

Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth.  

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2012 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities).  

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2011 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities), partially offset by an increase in net capital expenditures.  

Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt facilities as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises.   

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: We used net cash for financing activities in fiscal 2012 of $6.1 billion in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 of $516 million primarily due to our increase in common stock repurchases in fiscal 2012 (see discussion in Working Capital above and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), a reduction in the amount of debt that we issued in fiscal 2012 ($1.7 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility in May 2012 in comparison to $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2010 and $1.15 billion of borrowings pursuant to revolving credit facilities in May 2011), and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2012, in each case in comparison to fiscal 2011. These unfavorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2012 were partially offset by a decrease in cash used for debt related repayments during fiscal 2012 ($1.15 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facilities and $255 million of RightNows legacy convertible notes were repaid in February 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes and $881 million of commercial paper notes).

Table of Contents 

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 decreased due to a reduction in the amount of debt that we issued in fiscal 2011 ($1.15 billion borrowed pursuant to our revolving credit facilities and $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes issued) in comparison to fiscal 2010 ($4.5 billion of long-term senior notes and $2.8 billion of commercial paper notes issued). This unfavorable impact to our financing cash flows was partially offset by a cash favorable reduction in debt repayments during fiscal 2011 (repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes in January 2011 and $881 million of commercial paper notes) in comparison to fiscal 2010 (repayments of $1.9 billion of commercial paper notes, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and $700 million of Suns legacy convertible notes) and an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2011.  

Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. We financed $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, or approximately 16% of our new software license revenues in each of fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, and $134 million and $117 million, respectively, or approximately 3% of our hardware systems products revenues in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011.  

Recent Financing Activities:  

Revolving Credit Agreement: On May 29, 2012, we borrowed $1.7 billion pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent; and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2012 Credit Agreement). Interest for the 2012 Credit Agreement is based on either (x) a base rate calculated as the highest of (i) JPMorgans prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the LIBOR for deposits in U.S. Dollars plus 1%, or (y) LIBOR for deposits made in U.S. Dollars plus 0.35%, depending on the type of borrowings made by us. This borrowing is due on July 2, 2012, which is the termination date of the 2012 Credit Agreement. Additional details regarding the 2012 Credit Agreement are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  

On June 30, 2011, our revolving credit agreements with BNP Paribas, as initial lender and administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2011 Credit Agreements), to borrow $1.15 billion were repaid in full and the 2011 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms.  

RightNow Convertible Notes: Subsequent to the closing of our acquisition of RightNow, we repaid, in full, $255 million of RightNows legacy convertible notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2012.

Table of Contents 

Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011, we had $14.8 billion of senior notes outstanding of which $1.3 billion matures and is payable in fiscal 2013. In accordance with our obligations under a registration rights agreement entered into in July 2010 in connection with the original issuance of our $3.25 billion of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $1.0 billion of 3.875% notes due July 2020 (2020 Notes) and $2.25 billion of 5.375% notes due July 2040 (2040 Notes, and together with the 2020 Notes, the Original Senior Notes), on December 16, 2011 we completed a registered offer to exchange the Original Senior Notes for new freely tradable notes having terms substantially identical to the Original Senior Notes. An aggregate of $994 million principal amount of the 2020 Notes and an aggregate of $2.24 billion principal amount of the 2040 Notes were tendered and exchanged in the offer. Additional details regarding these senior notes and all other borrowings are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  

Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 20, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion. On June 18, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a further expansion by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2012, approximately $3.1 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program prior to the June 2012 additional amount authorized. We repurchased 207.3 million shares for $6.0 billion, 40.4 million shares for $1.2 billion and 43.3 million shares for $1.0 billion in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  

Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2012, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.24 per share that totaled $1.2 billion. In June 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock payable on August 3, 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 13, 2012. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2012:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Our total borrowings consisted of the following as of May 31, 2012 (dollars in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our July 2014 senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on the July 2014 senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using an interest rate of 1.39%, which represented our effective interest rate as of May 31, 2012 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair value of our debt associated with the interest rate risk that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements are included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of borrowings.  

 (2)   Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $249 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2012.  

 (3)   Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in this amount as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.  

As of May 31, 2012, we had $4.0 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately $47.5 million of these liabilities. Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2013.  

73  

Table of Contents 

We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2013.  

As described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we have contingent consideration payable as a result of our acquisition of Pillar Data Systems, Inc. that will settle in fiscal 2015.  

Subsequent to fiscal 2012, we agreed to acquire certain companies for amounts that are not material to our business. We expect to close such acquisitions within the next twelve months.  

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

Selected Quarterly Financial Data  

Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2013.  

The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards  

Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions.  

We recognize that options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2009 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Some of the outstanding options, which generally have a 10 year exercise period, have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. At May 31, 2012, 28.0% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2012, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 8.7%.  

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report.
