ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview  

 As discussed further in Item 1, Business, the Company derives virtually all of its revenues from airline related activities. The most significant source of airline revenues is passenger revenues; however, Mileage Plus, United Cargo, and United Services are also significant sources of operating revenues. The airline industry is highly competitive, and is characterized by intense price competition. Fare discounting by United's competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company's financial results because United has generally been required to match competitors' fares to maintain passenger traffic. Future competitive fare adjustments may negatively impact the Company's future financial results. The Company's most significant operating expense is jet fuel. Jet fuel prices are extremely volatile and are largely uncontrollable by the Company. UAL 's historical and future earnings have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by jet fuel prices. The impact of recent jet fuel price increases is discussed below.  

 Bankruptcy Matters. On December 9, 2002, UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize its business under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company emerged from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, under a Plan of Reorganization that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the Company adopted fresh-start reporting, which resulted in significant changes in post-emergence financial statements, as compared to the Company's historical financial statements. See the "Financial Results" section below for further discussion. See Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding bankruptcy matters.  

 Recent Developments. The Company believes its restructuring has made the Company competitive with other U.S. carriers. The Company's financial performance has continued to improve despite significant increases in fuel prices, as noted below. Average Mainline price per gallon has increased 22% from 2005 to 2007, which has negatively impacted the Company's unit costs and operating margins. However, between 2005 and 2007 the Company has been able to mitigate the negative impact of rising fuel costs through its restructuring accomplishments, improved revenues and other means, which have all contributed to UAL operating income of $1.0 billion in 2007, as compared to operating income (losses) of $447 million and $(219) million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, the Company's operating cash flow improved significantly to $2.1 billion, or 37%, in 2007 as compared to 2006.  

 United seeks to continuously improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers, reduce unit costs, and increase unit revenues. Some of the Company's more significant recent developments include the following:    

In 2007, UAL 's management and its Board of Directors completed a strategic planning session to discuss the future of United. The Company has developed a five-year plan, the ambition of which is to position United as the airline of choice for premium customers, employees and investors, while maintaining our fundamental commitment to safety and balancing the needs of all of our stakeholders. The Company's main focus continues to be strengthening our core business, and the plan includes a detailed roadmap of more than 250 initiatives and significant capital investment over the next five years. These investments are targeted to support improvements for customers and employees, and drive revenue growth and efficiency improvements. In addition to strengthening the performance of the airline, our plan also contemplates unlocking the value of business units such as United Services and Mileage Plus. Our goal is to generate returns to stockholders that are competitive with the U.S. industry in general.   

31 

The Company is currently evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize the value of its MRO business. During 2007, the Company met with various third parties and permitted such third parties to conduct due diligence with respect to a potential transaction involving the Company's MRO business (excluding the Company's line maintenance activities). The Company has received proposals and is in the process of evaluating these proposals. As discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, there can be no assurance any such transaction will occur, nor can there be any assurances with respect to the form or timing of any such transaction. 

The Company is currently evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize the value of its Mileage Plus business. In early 2008, the Company began the process of preparing Mileage Plus/ULS financial reports and analysis as part of our evaluation process that could eventually result in a possible disposition of part or all of a company that owns and operates the Mileage Plus program. As discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, there can be no assurance that any such transaction will occur. 

Effective May 5, 2008, United will charge certain customers a $25 service fee to check a second bag. Customers that have a certain status in Mileage Plus or Star Alliance will not be charged to check a second bag. United estimates that this and other changes to its baggage policy will generate more than $100 million annually in cost savings and new revenue. 

The Company's employees earned approximately $170 million in cash payments related to 2007 business performance, comprised of approximately $110 million in profit sharing, $40 million in success sharing awards and $20 million as part of the special distribution to UAL common stockholders. The majority of these payments will be made in the first four months of 2008. 

The Company has announced a $200 million cost reduction program for fiscal year 2008 following successful completion of its $400 million cost reduction program in 2007. 

In 2007, United entered into an agreement to sell its interest in Aeronautical Radio, Inc. ("ARINC"), to Radio Acquisition Corp., an affiliate of The Carlyle Group. ARINC is a provider of transportation communications and systems engineering. The transaction closed on October 25, 2007 and generated proceeds of $128 million and a pre-tax net gain of $41 million. 

In November 2007, the Company showcased the first of 97 international aircraft to be refitted with new first and business class premium seats, entertainment systems and other product enhancements with an inaugural flight from Washington Dulles to Frankfurt. With this flight, United earned the distinction of becoming the first U.S. carrier to offer 180-degree, lie-flat beds in business class on overseas flights. Upgrading of all 97 international aircraft is expected to be completed between late 2007 and early 2010. 

During 2007, the U.S. government and the European Union ("EU") signed a transatlantic aviation agreement to replace the existing bilateral arrangements between the U.S. Government and the 27 EU member states. The agreement will become effective at the end of March 2008. The future effects of this agreement on UAL cannot be predicted with certainty due to the variety of provisions affecting the competitive position of United and other U.S. and EU carriers subject to its terms; however, we have already taken actions to capitalize on opportunities under the new agreement. In September 2007, the DOT granted authority to effectuate antitrust immunity between United and bmi, and to include bmi in the multilateral group of Star Alliance carriers that had already been granted antitrust immunity by the DOT. This immunity goes into effect at the same time as the Open Skies treaty between the U.S. and the EU in March 2008.   

32 

 The Company strengthened its balance sheet by reducing on- and off-balance sheet debt by $2.3 billion during 2007. These significant debt reductions and refinancings, which are expected to reduce annual net financing costs by approximately $120 million, included:    

In the second quarter of 2007, United completed the issuance of $694 million of Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates ("EETC") secured debt financing that included thirteen aircraft, three of which were previously unencumbered. In the third quarter of 2007, in order to refinance certain aircraft at a lower cost United purchased three 747-400 aircraft that had previously been financed by United through operating leases. The lease agreements were simultaneously terminated upon the closing of the acquisition. The Company purchased these aircraft at a total price in excess of $150 million, largely with the proceeds of the EETC transaction executed by the Company in the second quarter of 2007. These two transactions combined did not change the total number of encumbered aircraft. 

In June 2007, the original $261 million principal amount of City and County of Denver, Colorado Special Facilities Airport Revenue Bonds Series 1992A was refinanced with $270 million in new Series 2007A bonds. 

In February 2007, United prepaid $972 million of its February 2006 $3.0 billion credit facility and amended certain terms of this facility creating a new $2.055 billion credit facility (the "Amended Credit Facility"). In December 2007, United prepaid $500 million of the term loan under the Amended Credit Facility. A December 2007 amendment of the Amended Credit Facility allows certain amounts of shareholder initiatives. In addition, in December 2007 UAL's Board of Directors approved a special distribution of $2.15 per common share, or approximately $257 million, that was paid on January 23, 2008.   

 The Company improved its passenger and cargo route network throughout 2007 and has announced new services to begin in 2008, including:    

United commenced non-stop daily service between Washington Dulles and Beijing, China in March 2007. 

United commenced daily, non-stop service between LAX and Hong Kong and between Washington Dulles and Rio de Janeiro in October 2007. 

United increased its thrice-weekly Washington Dulles-Kuwait service to daily frequency in December 2007 and a code-sharing agreement with Qatar Airways was also consummated. 

United commenced new daily service between LAX and Frankfurt, Germany in December 2007. 

The Company has announced new daily service from Denver to London Heathrow commencing in March 2008. 

The Company received DOT approval to become the first U.S. carrier to operate daily non-stop service from SFO to Guangzhou, China. This new service will commence in June 2008.   

 Financial Results. UAL and United adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance SOP 90-7 upon emerging from bankruptcy. Thus, the consolidated financial statements before February 1, 2006 reflect results based upon the historical cost basis of the Company while the post-emergence consolidated financial statements reflect the new basis of accounting, which incorporates fair value and other adjustments recorded from the application of SOP 90-7. Therefore, financial statements for the post-emergence periods are not comparable to the pre-emergence period financial statements. References to "Successor Company" refer to UAL and/or United on or after February 1, 2006, after giving effect to the adoption of fresh-start reporting. References to "Predecessor Company" refer to UAL and/or United before their exit from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006.  

33 

 For purposes of providing management's year-over-year discussions of the results of operations, management has compared the Successor Company results for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the combined 2006 annual results, consisting of the Successor Company's results for the eleven months ended December 31, 2006 and the Predecessor Company's January 2006 results, and to the Predecessor Company's annual 2005 results. The presentation of results for the combined twelve month period of 2006 are non-GAAP measures. However, management believes that these year-over-year comparisons of the results of operations provide management and investors a useful basis of comparison to the full years of 2007 and 2005. The discussion of financial results below includes a discussion of certain bankruptcy related matters that the Company has classified as special items in its  Statements of Consolidated Operations. These items have been classified as special because they are directly related to the resolution of bankruptcy administrative claims and are not indicative of the Company's ongoing financial performance.  

 The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and historically, the Company's results of operations are better in the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarters of each year, since our first and fourth quarter results normally reflect weaker travel demand. The Company's results of operations can be impacted by adverse weather, air traffic control delays and other factors in any period.  

 The table below presents certain financial statement items to provide an overview of UAL 's and United's financial performance for the three years ended December 31, 2007.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

UAL  

 UAL 's 2007 income before reorganization items, income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates improved by $740 million and $1.3 billion as compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following items highlight some of the more significant variances in the 2007 period as compared to 2006 and 2005. For a more detailed discussion of these items and additional factors impacting our financial performance see Results of Operations, below.    

The Company increased its annual mainline passenger unit revenue ("PRASM") by 7% between 2007 and 2006, and by 9% between 2006 and 2005, through continued capacity discipline and revenue execution. Including special items, 2007 passenger revenues increased by $1.1 billion and $3.0 billion as compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, the change in the Mileage Plus expiration period had a significant impact on passenger revenues, as discussed below.   

34 

United Express contributed $122 million to operating income in 2007, as compared to $77 million in 2006 and $317 million of operating losses in 2005. This improvement is due to an improved regional operations cost structure resulting from the bankruptcy reorganization, network optimization similar to that achieved for the mainline operation, and the replacement of some 50-seat regional jets with larger regional jets that are equipped with explus and offer both first class and Economy Plus service, among other factors. 

Mainline fuel costs have significantly increased since 2005, increasing by $179 million from 2006 to 2007, in addition to the $792 million increase from 2005 to 2006. These increases are primarily due to significant increases in market prices for jet fuel. The Company's average cost per gallon for jet fuel, including taxes and hedge impacts, increased from approximately $1.79 in 2005 to $2.11 in 2006 and $2.18 in 2007. Similar increases were experienced in United Express' average cost per gallon of jet fuel, which is classified as Regional affiliates expense in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. 

In 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded approximately $119 million and $9 million, respectively, of employee profit sharing, including related employee taxes, based on annual pre-tax earnings. The rate of profit sharing was increased from 7.5% to 15% between periods, and pre-tax income was significantly higher in 2007. A $110 million decrease in share-based compensation expense offset the increase in the Company's profit sharing plan expense. 

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased $157 million, or 16%, in 2007 as compared to 2006, and by $128 million, or 15%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. As further discussed in the "Results of Operations" section below, these increases are due to several factors, including higher volumes of heavy maintenance visits, increased rates under certain long-term maintenance contracts and a higher cost of parts. 

Interest expense decreased $109 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to $2.2 billion of decreased balance sheet debt outstanding and a credit facility amendment in February 2007 that significantly lowered our interest rate under the credit facility. Interest expense increased $288 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased debt outstanding of approximately $1.4 billion as a result of the Company's new capital structure resulting from its emergence from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006. 

In 2007 and 2006, UAL recognized income tax expense of $297 million and $21 million, respectively. Income taxes were not recorded in the 2005 period.   

 The following items describe the significant and largely non-cash fresh-start reporting impacts effective February 1, 2006 that affect the comparison of 2006 to 2005.    

As part of fresh-start reporting the Company changed its accounting for Mileage Plus from the incremental cost model to the deferred revenue model. This change in accounting negatively impacted the Company's operating revenues by approximately $158 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The negative revenue impact was partially offset by a reduction in operating expense of approximately $27 million which the Company estimates would have been recorded if the incremental cost method had been continued. Mileage Plus accounting is discussed further in "Critical Accounting Policies," below. 

The Company recorded non-cash share-based compensation expense of $159 million in 2006 in association with its share-based compensation plans. This expense was not recognized in 2005, because prior to 2006 the Company accounted for its share-based compensation plans under the intrinsic method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."   

35 

The Company recognized non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $74 million on assets that were recorded at fair value as part of fresh-start reporting, including definite-lived intangible assets that were recognized under fresh-start accounting. UAL did not recognize similar asset values or related amortization expense in the preceding annual periods. 

The adjustment of the Company's postretirement plan liabilities to fair value at fresh-start resulted in the elimination of unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses for its non-pension postretirement plan. The elimination of these unrecognized items negatively impacted the Company's 2006 expenses by approximately $51 million. 

Aircraft rent was negatively impacted by approximately $101 million. This included an unfavorable impact of $66 million related to deferred gains on pre-emergence sale-leaseback transactions that were eliminated as part of fresh-start reporting. Before fresh-start reporting, these deferred gains were being amortized into earnings over the lease terms as a reduction of the related aircraft rent expense. Also due to the restructuring of aircraft financings in bankruptcy, the Company's operating leases were at average rates below market value; therefore, a deferred charge was recorded to adjust these leases to fair value. Amortization of this deferred charge resulted in additional rent expense of approximately $35 million in 2006. 

The Company recognized additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $51 million for the amortization of debt and capital lease obligation discounts that were recorded upon its emergence from bankruptcy to adjust its debt and capital lease obligations to fair value. 

The January 2006 reorganization income of approximately $22.9 billion and $22.7 billion for UAL and United, respectively, primarily relates to the discharge of liabilities and other fresh-start adjustments recorded in connection with the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. In 2005, reorganization charges of approximately $20.6 billion and $20.4 billion for UAL and United, respectively, were primarily for pension, employee-related, and aircraft claim charges of $8.9 billion, $6.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. For additional information, see Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Financial Statement Presentation," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

At the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, there were certain unresolved matters which are considered to be preconfirmation contingencies. The Company initially recorded on the Effective Date an obligation for its best estimate of the amounts it expected to pay to resolve these matters. Adjustments to these initial estimates are recorded in current results of operations. See Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Claims Resolution Process," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these adjustments.   

United  

 From 2006 to 2007, the improvement in United's results was largely consistent with that of UAL with United's 2007 net income improving to $402 million as compared to UAL 's 2007 net income of $403 million. The primary difference between United's and UAL 's net income for the combined twelve months of 2006 was a $225 million variance in reorganization income that was primarily due to $239 million of additional UAL income from the discharge of certain bankruptcy claims and liabilities that existed at UAL, but not at United. In 2005, UAL 's net loss was approximately $140 million greater than United's loss due to a $131 million larger bankruptcy-related impairment charge on lease certificates.  

 Liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, UAL had total cash, including restricted cash and short-term investments, of $4.3 billion. The Company's strong cash position resulted from its recapitalization upon emergence from bankruptcy, together with strong operating cash flows of $2.1 billion in 2007, as  

36 

compared to $1.6 billion in 2006 and $1.1 billion in 2005. UAL used cash of approximately $257 million to pay a $2.15 per common share special distribution in January 2008.  

 In addition, the Company reduced its balance sheet debt during 2007 by approximately $2.2 billion. Most of the debt reduction related to the Company's credit facility, which was reduced by $1.5 billion in 2007. The Company amended its credit facility twice during 2007 and prepaid debt following its February 2007 and December 2007 amendments. Total debt consisting of on-balance sheet debt, the Denver municipal bonds, estimated off-balance sheet debt related to operating leases and open market debt repurchases decreased by $2.3 billion.  

 The Company has significant noncancelable contractual cash payment obligations associated with debt and aircraft and facility leases, among others. In addition, the Company has aircraft purchase commitments; however, the commitments are generally cancelable. However, the cancellations could result in forfeiture of the Company's deposits. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section, below, for further information related to the credit facility amendments and the Company's contractual obligations.  

 Contingencies. During the course of its Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims against the Debtors. The following discussion provides a summary of the material matters yet to be resolved in the Bankruptcy Court, as well as other contingencies. For further information on these matters, see Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases" and Note 15, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Municipal Bond Obligation & Off-Balance Sheet Financing. We are a party to numerous long-term agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance facilities that are financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds issued by various local municipalities to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities. United had been advised during its restructuring that these municipal bonds may have been unsecured (or in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt. In 2006, certain of United's municipal bond obligations relating to LAX and SFO were conclusively adjudicated through the Bankruptcy Court as financings and not true leases; however, there remains pending litigation to determine the value of the security interests, if any, that the bondholders at LAX and SFO have in our underlying leaseholds.  

 United has guaranteed $270 million of the City and County of Denver, Colorado Special Facilities Airport Revenue Bonds (United Air Lines Project) Series 2007A (the "Denver Bonds"). This guarantee replaces our prior guarantee of $261 million of bonds issued by the City and County of Denver, Colorado in 1992. These bonds are callable by United. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the Company's Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. However, the related lease agreement is accounted for on a straight-line basis resulting in a ratable accrual of the final $270 million payment over the lease term.  

 Legal and Environmental. The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. When appropriate, the Company accrues for these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of their eventual disposition. The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims.  

37 

 The Company anticipates that if ultimately found liable, its damages from claims arising from the events of September 11, 2001, could be significant; however, the Company believes that, under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001, its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage.  

 The Company is also currently analyzing whether any potential liability may result from air cargo/passenger surcharge cartel investigations following the receipt of a Statement of Objections that the European Commission (the "Commission") issued to 26 carriers on December 18, 2007. The Statement of Objections sets out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the Commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal price-fixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry. United received a copy of the Statement of Objections and is currently evaluating the Commission's evidence related to the Company and its personnel. United is cooperating with the Commission's investigation. United intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges in its formal response to the Commission and in the European Court of Justice if necessary. The Company's evaluation of this matter is still in the early stages, and based upon the information currently available no reserve for potential liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2007. However, penalties for violation of European competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the Company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

 Many aspects of United's operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment. Future regulatory developments in the U.S. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. For example, potential future actions that may be taken by the U.S. government, state governments within the U.S., foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to limit the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry are uncertain at this time, but the impact to the Company and its industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.  

Results of Operations  

 As described in the "Overview" section above, presentation of the combined twelve month period of 2006 is a non-GAAP measure; however, management believes it is useful for comparison with the full years of 2007 and 2005. United's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL 's revenues and operating expenses. Therefore, the following qualitative discussion is applicable to both UAL and United, unless otherwise noted. Any significant differences between UAL and United results are separately disclosed and explained.  

 UAL 's earnings from operations of $1.0 billion in 2007 improved by $590 million as compared to earnings from operations of $447 million in 2006. The significant increase in operating earnings was due to increased revenues, cost control and special items as discussed below. UAL 's net income was $403 million in 2007 as compared to $22.9 billion in 2006. The most significant variance is reorganization income of $22.9 billion that was recorded in the 2006 period. Lower interest expense due to debt reductions and refinancings and a gain on the sale of an investment, as discussed below, also benefited 2007 net income as compared to 2006.  

 United's improvement in earnings from operations of $573 million was consistent with UAL 's results. United's net income was $402 million in 2007 as compared to net income of $22.7 billion in 2006, with the difference in net income primarily due to reorganization income that was recorded in the 2006 period. See Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Financial Statement Presentation" in Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on reorganization items.

     Operating Revenues.  

2007 compared to 2006  

 The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage changes in UAL and United operating revenues. The primary difference between UAL and United revenues is due to other revenues at UAL, which are generated from minor direct subsidiaries of UAL.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined 2006 period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

 The table below presents selected UAL and United passenger revenues and operating data from our Mainline segment, broken out by geographic region, and from our United Express segment, expressed as year-over-year changes. Passenger revenues presented below include the effects of the $45 million special revenue items on Mainline ($37 million) and United Express ($8 million) revenue, which resulted directly from the Company's ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy pre-confirmation contingencies.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)Variances are from the combined 2006 period that includes the results for the one month period ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor) and the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006 (Successor). 

(b)Yield is a measure of average price paid per passenger mile, which is calculated by dividing passenger revenues by RPMs. Yields for geographic regions exclude charter revenue and RPMs.  

 Including the special revenue items, Mainline and United Express passenger revenues increased by $924 million and $170 million, respectively, in 2007 as compared to 2006. In 2007, Mainline revenues benefited from a 0.6 point increase in load factor and a 7% increase in yield as compared to 2006. In the same periods, United Express load factor was relatively flat while yield and traffic both increased  

39 

3% resulting in the 6% increase in revenue. Overall, passenger revenues increased due to a better revenue environment for the industry which was partly due to industry-wide capacity constraint. The Company's shift of some capacity and traffic from domestic to higher yielding international flights also benefited revenues in 2007. In addition, the change in the Mileage Plus expiration period policy also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2007. Mileage Plus revenue, included in passenger revenues, was approximately $169 million higher in 2007. This impact was largely due to a change in the Mileage Plus expiration period policy from 36 months to 18 months, as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, below. Mileage Plus customer accounts are deactivated after 18 months of inactivity, effective December 31, 2007. Severe winter storms in December 2007 at the Chicago and Denver hubs resulted in the cancellation of approximately 6,400 United and United Express flights at these locations and had the estimated impact of reducing revenue by $25 million and reducing total expenses by $2 million. Similarly in December 2006, the Chicago and Denver hubs canceled approximately 3,900 United and United Express flights with an estimated impact of reducing revenue and total expenses by $40 million and $11 million, respectively.  

 Cargo revenues increased by $20 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. Freight revenue increased due to both higher yields and higher volume. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in mail revenue due to lower 2007 volume as a result of the termination of the U.S. Postal Service ("USPS") contract on June 30, 2006. United signed a new USPS contract effective April, 2007.  

 UAL other operating revenues decreased by $311 million, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. Lower jet fuel sales to third parties by our subsidiary, United Aviation Fuels Corporation ("UAFC") accounted for $307 million of the other revenue decrease. This decrease in jet fuel sales was due to several factors, including decreased UAFC sales to our regional affiliates, our decision not to renew various low margin supply agreements to other carriers, and decreased sales of excess inventory. This decrease had no material impact on the Company's operating margin, because UAFC cost of sales decreased by $306 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year.  

2006 compared to 2005  

 The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in major categories of UAL 's and United's operating revenues.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined 2006 period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

 Strong demand, industry capacity restraint, yield improvements, United's resource optimization initiatives, and ongoing airline network optimization all contributed to a $2.0 billion increase in total  

40 

operating revenue to $19.3 billion in 2006. The 11% mainline passenger revenue increase was due to both increased traffic and higher average ticket prices; United reported a 3% increase in mainline traffic on a 2% increase in capacity and an 8% increase in yield. Severe winter storms in December 2006 at the Chicago and Denver hubs, which resulted in the cancellation of approximately 3,900 United and United Express flights at these locations, had the estimated impact of reducing revenue by $40 million and reducing total expenses by $11 million. As discussed in "Critical Accounting Policies," below, the Company changed the accounting for its frequent flyer obligation to a deferred revenue model upon its emergence from bankruptcy which negatively impacted revenues by $158 million. This resulted in increased deferred revenue due to a net increase in miles earned by Mileage Plus customers that will be redeemed in future years.  

 In 2005, UAL 's other revenues were $75 million more than United's other revenues primarily due to revenues generated by UAL 's direct subsidiary MyPoints, which was sold by UAL in 2006.  

 The 19% increase in regional affiliate revenues was also due to traffic and yield improvements as indicated in the table below.  

 The increase in cargo revenue was primarily due to improved yield, which was partially due to higher fuel surcharges between periods.  

 The table below presents selected passenger revenues and operating data by geographic region and the Company's mainline and United Express segments expressed as period-to-period changes:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses.  

2007 compared to 2006  

 The table below includes the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UAL and United operating expenses. Significant fluctuations are discussed below.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

 As discussed in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, distribution expenses include commissions, GDS fees and credit card transaction fees. Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period  

42 

presentation. Previously, GDS and credit card transaction fees were classified as components of purchased services and commissions were reported as a separate expense item in the UAL and United 2006 Annual Reports.  

 Mainline aircraft fuel increased $179 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006. This net fuel variance was due to a 4% increase in the average price per gallon of jet fuel from $2.11 in 2006 to $2.18 in 2007, resulting from unfavorable market conditions. Included in the 2007 average price per gallon was an $83 million net hedge gain; a net fuel hedge loss of $26 million is included in the 2006 average price per gallon.  

 UAL salaries and related costs remained relatively flat in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Company recognized $49 million of share-based compensation expense in 2007 as compared to $159 million in 2006. There were no significant grants in 2007 as compared to 2006, which included a large number of grants associated with the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. Additionally, immediate recognition of 100% of the cost of awards granted to retirement-eligible employees on the grant date, together with accelerated vesting of grants within the first twelve months after the grant date, accounted for most of the decrease in share-based compensation expense. Also benefiting the 2007 period was the absence of the $22 million severance charge incurred in 2006. Offsetting the decreased share-based compensation and severance expense was a slight increase in salaries and related costs as a result of certain wage increases as well as a $110 million increase in profit sharing, including related employee taxes, which is based on annual pre-tax earnings. As noted above, this increase is due to increased pre-tax earnings and an increase in the payout percentage from 7.5% in 2006 to 15% in 2007.  

 Regional affiliate expense, which includes aircraft fuel, increased $117 million, or 4%, during 2007 as compared to 2006. Regional affiliate capacity increased 4% in 2007, which was a major contributor to the increase in expense. Including the special revenue item of $8 million, our regional affiliate operating income was $53 million higher in the 2007 period as compared to the 2006 period. The margin improvement was due to improved revenue performance, which was due to increased yield and traffic, and cost control. Factors impacting regional affiliate margin include the restructuring of regional carrier capacity agreements, the replacement of some 50-seat regional jets with 70-seat regional jets and regional carrier network optimization. All of these improvements were put in place throughout 2006; therefore, we realized some year-over-year benefits in 2007. Regional affiliate fuel expense increased $81 million, or 10%, from $834 million in 2006 to $915 million in 2007 due to a 9% increase in the average price of fuel and a 1% increase in consumption.  

 Purchased services were up 8% in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to increased information technology and other costs incurred in support of the Company's customer and employee initiatives. Information technology expenses increased due to an increase in non-capitalizable information technology related expenditures, generally occurring during the planning and scoping phases, for new applications in 2007. In addition, airport operations handling and security costs increased due to the new USPS contract and new international routes, among other factors.  

 Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased $157 million, or 16%, year-over-year primarily due to inflationary increases related to our V2500 engine maintenance contract and the cost of component parts, as well as the impact of increases in airframe and engine repair volumes.  

 A charge of $18 million in 2007 for surplus and obsolete aircraft parts inventory accounted for approximately half of the 4% increase in depreciation and amortization.  

 Ongoing efforts to efficiently utilize our rented facilities have offset contractual rent increases, keeping 2007 rent expense in line with 2006 rent expense.  

 In 2007, United's mainline revenues increased by 6%. During the same period of time, distribution expenses, which include commissions, GDS fees and credit card fees decreased 2% from $798 million  

43 

in 2006 to $779 million in 2007. This decrease was due to cost savings realized as the Company continues to drive reductions across the full spectrum of costs of sale. Impact areas included renegotiation of contracts with various channel providers, rationalization of commission plans and programs, and continued emphasis on movement of customer purchases toward lower cost channels including online channels. Such efforts resulted in a 9% year-over-year reduction in GDS fees and commissions.  

 The decrease in cost of sales in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower UAFC third party fuel sales of $307 million as described in the discussion of revenue variances above.  

 Special items of $44 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 include a $30 million benefit due to the reduction in recorded accruals for pending bankruptcy litigation related to our SFO and LAX municipal bond obligations and a $14 million benefit due to the Company's ongoing efforts to resolve certain other bankruptcy pre-confirmation contingencies. In the eleven months ended December 31, 2006, special items of $36 million included a $12 million benefit to adjust the Company's recorded obligation for the SFO and LAX municipal bonds and a $24 million benefit related to pre-confirmation pension matters. The 2007 and 2006 special items resulted from revised estimates of the probable amount to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, and were recorded in accordance with AICPA Practice Bulletin 11, Accounting for Preconfirmation Contingencies in Fresh-Start Reporting. See Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11" and Note 20, "Special Items" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these special items and pending matters.  

2006 compared to 2005  

 The table below includes the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in operating expenses. Significant fluctuations are discussed below.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

44 

      [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

 In 2006, United implemented a resource optimization initiative that increased the number of mainline ASMs by 1% and United Express ASMs by 3%, for a consolidated ASM growth of 2%, without the use of additional aircraft. In addition to generating increased revenue, this contributed to additional variable expenses such as fuel, salaries, and other expense items.  

 In 2006, mainline aircraft fuel expense increased 20% due to an increase in average mainline fuel cost from $1.79 per gallon in 2005 to $2.11 per gallon in 2006, while fuel consumption increased 2% on a similar increase in mainline capacity. The Company recognized a net fuel hedge loss of $26 million in aircraft fuel expense in 2006, which is included in the $2.11 per gallon average cost, whereas in 2005 most fuel hedging gains and losses were recorded in non-operating income and expense. In 2005, the Company recorded $40 million of fuel hedging gains in non-operating income, as discussed below.  

 UAL 's salaries and related costs increased $240 million, or 6%, in 2006 as compared to the prior year. In 2006 the Company recorded $159 million of expense, representing 4% of the increase in salaries and related costs, for Successor UAL 's share-based compensation plans because of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," effective January 1, 2006. In addition, the Company incurred an additional $26 million related to employee performance incentive programs in 2006 as compared to 2005. The Company also recorded $64 million in higher postretirement expenses and $35 million in higher medical and dental expenses in 2006 than in 2005. Salaries also increased due to merit increases awarded to employees in 2006, which were infrequent throughout bankruptcy. These cost increases were partially offset by a 6% year-over-year improvement in labor productivity resulting from the Company's continuous improvement efforts, together with selective outsourcing of certain non-core functions. In 2006, the Company achieved its goal to reduce 1,000 management and administrative positions.  

 The Company's most significant regional affiliate expenses are capacity payments to the regional carriers and fuel expense. Fuel accounted for 30% of the Company's regional affiliate expense in 2006, as compared to 26% in 2005. Fuel cost increased due to increased market prices for jet fuel, as discussed above, and increased fuel consumption from higher capacity. The Company's regional affiliate  

45 

expense increased only 3% despite a 9% increase in capacity due to the benefits of restructured regional carrier capacity agreements in 2006 along with regional carrier network optimization and the replacement of some 50-seat regional jets with 70-seat regional jets. The 3% increase in regional affiliates expense includes an 18% increase in fuel costs. See Note 2(j), "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesUnited Express," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Regional affiliates expense.  

 The Company's purchased services increased 18% in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase of approximately $120 million in outsourcing costs for various non-core work activities; as well as a $31 million increase in certain professional fees, which were classified as reorganization expenses by the Predecessor Company. The offsetting benefits of higher outsourcing costs are reflected in a 4% reduction in manpower associated with the 6% labor productivity improvement noted for salaries and related costs.  

 In 2006, aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased $128 million, or 15%, from 2005 primarily due to engine-related maintenance rate increases as well as increased repair volume.  

 As discussed in Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Fresh-Start Reporting," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company revalued its assets and liabilities to estimated fair values. In 2006, UAL 's amortization expense increased $162 million due to the recognition of $453 million of additional definite-lived intangible assets; however, this increase was offset by decreased depreciation expense from fresh-start reporting adjustments that significantly reduced depreciable tangible asset book values to fair value. The impact of the decrease in tangible asset valuation was significant as depreciation and amortization only increased $32 million despite the $162 million increase in intangible asset amortization and incremental depreciation on post-emergence property additions. The fresh-start impacts on United's depreciation and amortization expense were not materially different than the UAL impacts.  

 The Company's distribution expenses, which include commissions, GDS fees and credit card fees, increased $23 million, or 3%, year-over-year primarily due to a $24 million increase in credit card fees due to higher passenger revenues.  

 UAL 's and United's other operating expenses decreased $104 million and $96 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, respectively. The adoption of fresh-start reporting, which included the revaluation of the Company's frequent flyer obligation to estimated fair value and the change in accounting policy to a deferred revenue model for the Successor Company reduced other expense by an estimated $27 million. For periods on or after February 1, 2006, adjustments to the frequent flyer obligation are recorded to passenger and other operating revenues, whereas periodic adjustments under the Predecessor Company's incremental cost basis were recognized in both operating revenues and other operating expense. See "Critical Accounting Policies," below, for further details. Various cost savings initiatives also reduced the Company's costs in 2006 as compared to 2005.  

 In 2006, the Company recognized a net benefit of $36 million to operating expense resulting from the resolution of preconfirmation contingencies for the estimated liability for SFO and LAX municipal bond obligations, and favorable adjustments to preconfirmation contingencies related to the pilots non-qualified pension plan. In 2005, UAL and United recognized charges of $18 million and $5 million, respectively, for aircraft impairments related to the planned accelerated retirement of certain aircraft.

Other Income (Expense).  

2007 compared to 2006  

 The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in other income (expense).   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

 UAL interest expense decreased $109 million, or 14%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease was due to the February and December 2007 amendments and prepayments of the credit facility, which lowered United's interest rate on these obligations and reduced the total obligations outstanding by approximately $1.5 billion. Repayments of scheduled maturities of debt obligations and other debt refinancings, which are discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources," below, also reduced interest expense. The 2007 period also included a $22 million reduction in interest expense due to the recognition of a gain on debt extinguishment. These benefits were offset by interest expense of $17 million for expensing previously capitalized debt issuance costs that were associated with the February 2007 prepayment of the credit facility, and $6 million for financing costs incurred in connection with the February amendment of the credit facility. The $500 million Amended Credit Facility prepayment in December 2007 increased interest expense by a net of $4 million from expensing $6 million of previously capitalized credit facility costs and recording a gain of $2 million to recognize previously deferred interest rate swap gains.  

 UAL interest income increased $8 million, or 3%, year-over-year. Interest income increased due to the classification of $6 million of interest income as reorganization items in the January 2006 predecessor period in accordance with SOP 90-7.  

 The $41 million gain on sale of investment resulted from the Company's sale of its 21.1% interest in ARINC.  

47 

      The unfavorable variances in miscellaneous income (expense) are primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of $9 million in 2006 as compared to foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million in 2007.  

Income Taxes.  

 UAL and United recorded income tax expense of $297 million and $296 million (an effective tax rate of 43%), respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $21 million and $29 million (an effective tax rate of 49% and 50%) for UAL and United, respectively, for the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006. The increase in income tax expense in 2007 was primarily due to a significant increase in pre-tax income in 2007 as compared to the 2006 Successor period. Due to the Company's significant net operating losses in prior periods, cash paid for taxes in 2007 was only $10 million. See Note 6, "Income Taxes" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of permanent items impacting the effective tax rates.  

2006 compared to 2005  

 The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in consolidated other income (expense).   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined period includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).  

 UAL and United incurred $288 million and $279 million, respectively, of increases in interest expense partly due to the higher outstanding principal balance of the credit facility for the Successor Company, as compared to the lower debtor-in-possession credit facility (the "DIP Financing") balance for the Predecessor Company. Interest expense in 2006 was also unfavorably impacted by the associated amortization of various discounts which were recorded on debt instruments and capital leases to record these obligations at fair value upon the adoption of fresh-start reporting. UAL 's and United's 2006 interest income increased $211million and $220 million, respectively, reflecting a higher cash balance in 2006, as well as higher rates of return on certain investments. Interest income also increased due to the  

48 

classification of most interest income in 2005 as a component of reorganization expense in accordance with SOP 90-7. In 2005, the Company recorded $40 million of fuel hedge gains which did not qualify for hedge accounting in non-operating income, while in 2006 the $26 million net realized and unrealized loss from economic fuel hedges was recognized in aircraft fuel expense.  

 See Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Financial Statement Presentation," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Reorganization items, net recognized in January 2006 and during the year ended December 31, 2005.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The following table provides a summary of UAL's and United's cash position at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and net cash provided (used) by operating, financing and investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006 and the one month period ended January 31, 2006.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

       [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)The combined period includes the results for the one month period ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor) and the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006 (Successor).  

 The Company's significant cash and short-term investment position represents a source of liquidity. The Company believes that it should have sufficient liquidity to fund its operating and capital cash requirements for 2008 through cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and general corporate financings. The change in cash from 2005 to 2007 is explained below. Restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers' compensation obligations, security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future.  

 Liquidity. UAL 's total of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments was $4.3 billion and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, including restricted cash of $756 million and $847 million, respectively. The Company used its strong operating cash flows to reduce its debt balances by approximately $1.5 billion through its credit facility prepayments of $972 million in February 2007 and $500 million in December 2007. The Amended Credit Facility  

49 

consists of an initial $1.8 billion term loan in February 2007, which was paid down to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2007, and a $255 million revolving commitment of which $153 million was available at December 31, 2007.  

 Certain terms of the credit facility were amended in February 2007 thereby creating the Amended Credit Facility. A further amendment in December 2007 authorizes certain shareholder initiatives. This enabled UAL to pay a $2.15 per common share special distribution of approximately $257 million on January 23, 2008. At the Company's option, interest payments on the Amended Credit Facility are based on either a base rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, or at LIBOR plus 2%. This applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans is a significant reduction of 1.75% from the terms of the credit facility. The February 2007 amendment released a significant amount of assets that had been pledged as collateral under the credit facility. See the "Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" section, below, for information related to scheduled maturities on the credit facility.  

 In January 2007, the Company decided to terminate the interest rate swap that had been used to hedge the future interest payments under the original credit facility term loan of $2.45 billion.  

 Restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers' compensation obligations, security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process United's credit card ticket sales. Certain of the credit card processing arrangements are based on the aggregate then-outstanding bank card air traffic liability, the Company's credit rating and its compliance with certain debt covenants. Credit rating downgrades or debt covenant noncompliance could materially increase the Company's reserve requirements.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities.  

2007 compared to 2006  

 The Company's cash from operations improved by more than $500 million year-over-year. The Company's improvement in net income excluding reorganization items, which are primarily non-cash, was a significant factor contributing to the increase in operating cash flows. Operating cash flows for 2007 also include the favorable impact of an increase in non-cash income tax expense of nearly $300 million as compared to 2006. Cash from operations improved due to the Company's improved performance in 2007, as discussed above in the "Results of Operations" section, above. In addition, cash from operations improved due to a reduction of $124 million in cash interest payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of the financing activities completed in 2007 to reduce debt and interest rates. The improvement in cash generated from operations that was due to better operating performance was further enhanced by a decrease in operating cash used for working capital. In 2007, the Company contributed approximately $236 million and $14 million to its defined contribution plans and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, as compared to contributions of $270 million in 2006 for these plans.  

2006 compared to 2005  

 The Company generated cash from operations of $1.6 billion in 2006 compared to $1.1 billion in 2005. The higher operating cash flow generated in 2006 was due to improved results of operations as discussed above in the "Results of Operation" section, together with differences in the timing and amount of working capital items, and other smaller changes. As discussed in the "Results of Operations" section, above, the Company's 2006 net income includes significant non-cash items.  

 The Company does not have any significant defined benefit pension plan contribution requirements as most of the Company-sponsored plans were replaced with defined contribution plans upon its emergence from bankruptcy. The Company contributed approximately $259 million and  

50 

$11 million to its defined contribution plans and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, in the eleven months ended December 31, 2006.  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.  

2007 compared to 2006  

 UAL 's and United's cash released from restricted funds was $91 million and $87 million, respectively, in 2007 as compared to $310 million and $319 million that was provided by a decrease in the segregated and restricted funds for UAL and United, respectively, in 2006. The significant cash generated from restricted accounts in 2006 was due to our improved financial position upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Net purchases of short-term investments used cash of $2.0 billion for both UAL and United in 2007 as compared to cash used for net purchases of short-term investments of $0.2 billion in 2006. This change was due to investing additional excess cash in longer-term commercial paper in 2007 to increase investment yields. Investing activities in 2007 also includes the Company's use of $96 million of cash to acquire certain of the Company's previously issued and outstanding debt instruments. The debt instruments repurchased by the Company remain outstanding. See Note 12, "Debt Obligations," in  Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the $96 million of purchased debt securities.  

 The Company's capital expenditures were $658 million and $362 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, including the purchase of six aircraft during 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company purchased three 747-400 aircraft that had previously been financed by United through operating leases which were terminated at closing. The total purchase price for these aircraft was largely financed with certain proceeds from the secured EETC financing described below. These transactions did not result in any change in the Company's fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft, or in the amount of aircraft encumbered by debt or lease agreements.  

 During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company used existing cash to acquire three aircraft that were previously financed under operating lease agreements. The total purchase price of these three aircraft and the three aircraft acquired in the third quarter of 2007 was approximately $200 million. This purchase did not result in any change in the Company's fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft, but did unencumber three aircraft.  

 In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company utilized existing aircraft deposits pursuant to the terms of the original capital lease to make the final lease payments on three aircraft, resulting in the reclassification of the aircraft from capital leased assets to owned assets. However, the purchase of these three aircraft did not result in a net change in cash because the Company had previously provided cash deposits equal to the purchase price of the aircraft to third party financial institutions for the benefit of the lessor. These transactions resulted in three additional aircraft becoming unencumbered for a total increase of six unencumbered aircraft during the year.  

 During 2007, the Company sold its interest in ARINC, generating proceeds of $128 million. In 2006, UAL received $43 million more in cash proceeds from investing activities as compared to United primarily due to $56 million of proceeds from the sale of MyPoints, a former direct subsidiary of UAL.  

2006 compared to 2005  

 Cash released from segregated funds after exit from bankruptcy in 2006 provided $200 million in cash proceeds. UAL 's sale of the subsidiary MyPoints.com, Inc. generated an additional $56 million in cash proceeds in 2006 as compared to 2005. UAL 's and United's cash used for increases in short-term investments in 2006 was $235 million and $231 million, respectively, as compared to no material purchases or sales of short-term investments in 2005. A reduction in restricted cash balances provided $110 million and $119 million of cash proceeds in 2006 for UAL and United, respectively, as compared  

51 

to cash used to increase restricted cash of $80 million and $72 million in 2005 for UAL and United, respectively.  

 The $39 million of cash provided during 2006 from the disposition of property and equipment included $19 million of cash proceeds from the sale of nine non-operating B767-200 aircraft. The Company used $362 million in cash for the acquisition of property and equipment in 2006, as compared to approximately $470 million in 2005.  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities.  

2007 compared to 2006  

 Cash used by financing activities for both UAL and United was $2.1 billion in 2007, as compared to $0.8 billion of cash provided by financing activities during 2006. In 2007, cash of approximately $2.9 billion was used to prepay approximately $1.5 billion of credit facility obligations, refinance certain aircraft as discussed below and to make other debt and capital lease payments.  

 In 2007, the Company completed financing transactions totaling approximately $964 million which included the $694 million EETC secured financing and the $270 million Denver Airport financing. A portion of the proceeds of the $694 million EETC transaction was used to payoff $590 million of debt obligations that were secured by ten previously mortgaged, owned aircraft and to finance three previously unencumbered owned aircraft. The proceeds of the Denver Airport bonds were used to refinance the former $261 million of Denver Series 1992A bonds.  

 In both February and December 2007, United amended certain terms of its credit facility. The February 2007 amendment resulted in a reduction in the amount of the Amended Credit Facility from $3.0 billion to $2.055 billion, consisting of a $1.8 billion term loan commitment and a $255 million revolving commitment. The December 2007 amendment allowed the Company to pay the January 2008 special distribution of $257 million and provides the Company the ability to undertake an additional $243 million in future shareholder initiatives without any additional prepayment. At December 31, 2007, $153 million was available for loans or standby letters of credit under the Amended Credit Facility. See Note 12, "Debt Obligations" in Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the financing transactions discussed above.  

 In 2007, cash from aircraft lease deposits increased $80 million primarily due to the use of the deposits to purchase the three previously leased assets described above in "Cash Flows from Investing Activities." This was reported as a financing cash inflow as the prepayment of the initial deposits were recorded as a financing cash outflow.  

 During 2006, we generated proceeds of $3.0 billion from United's new credit facility but used approximately $2.1 billion of these proceeds to repay the $1.2 billion DIP Financing and make other scheduled and revolving payments under long-term debt and capital lease agreements.  

2006 compared to 2005  

 Cash generated through financing activities was $782 million in 2006 compared to cash used of $110 million in 2005. In 2006, the Company made principal payments under long-term debt and capital lease obligations totaling $2.1 billion, which included $1.2 billion for the repayment of the DIP Financing.  

 In 2006, the Company obtained access to up to $3.0 billion in secured exit financing which consisted of a $2.45 billion term loan, a $350 million delayed draw term loan and a $200 million revolving credit line. On the Effective Date, $2.45 billion of the $2.8 billion term loan and the entire revolving credit line was drawn and used to repay the DIP Financing and to make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy, as well as to provide ongoing liquidity to conduct  

52 

post-reorganization operations. Subsequently, the Company repaid borrowings under the revolving credit line and accessed the remaining $350 million on the delayed draw term loan. At December 31, 2006, the Company had a total of $2.8 billion of debt and $63 million in letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility.  

 During 2006, the Company secured control of 14 aircraft that were included in the 1997-1 EETC transaction by remitting $281 million to the 1997-1 EETC trustee on behalf of the holders of the Tranche A certificates. The Company subsequently refinanced the 14 aircraft on March 28, 2006 with the $350 million delayed draw term loan provided under the credit facility. The 14 aircraft are comprised of four B737 aircraft, two B747 aircraft, four B777 aircraft and four A320 aircraft.  

 Significant 2006 non-cash financing and investment activities included the conversion of six B757 aircraft and one B747 aircraft from leased to owned status resulting in additional aircraft assets and debt obligations of $242 million. In addition, in the first quarter of 2006 the Successor Company completed a transaction that converted certain mortgaged aircraft to capital leases for $155 million. See Note 17, "Statement of Consolidated Cash FlowsSupplemental Disclosures," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company's business is very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.  

 The table below provides a summary of the Company's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. Amounts presented are for both UAL and United, except as noted below.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)United's debt obligations are approximately $3 million lower than UAL 's due to $3 million of debt obligations of a direct subsidiary of UAL. Long-term debt includes $127 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a third party lessee of the aircraft and the creditor's only recourse to United is repossession of the aircraft. United's aircraft lease payments are $7 million higher than UAL's because United leases one aircraft from a direct subsidiary of UAL. 

(b)Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.  

53 

(c)Mainline includes non-aircraft capital lease payments of $5 million in each of the years 2008 through 2011. United Express payments are all for aircraft. United has lease deposits of $516 million in separate accounts to meet certain of its future capital lease obligations. 

(d)Amounts represent lease payments that are made by United under capacity agreements with the regional carriers who operate these aircraft on United's behalf. 

(e)Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2017. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded. Not included in the table above are contributions related to the Company's foreign pension plans. The Company does not have any significant contributions required by government regulations. The Company's expected pension plan contributions for 2008 are $29 million. 

(f)Amounts are principally for aircraft and exclude advance payments. The Company has the right to cancel its commitments for the purchase of 42 A319 and A320 aircraft; however, such action could cause the forfeiture of $91 million of advance payments. 

(g)Represents estimated uncertain income tax position liabilities in accordance with FIN 48. The settlement period is undeterminable.  

 See Note 2(j), "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesUnited Express," Note 9, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans," Note 12, "Debt Obligations," and Note 16, "Lease Obligations," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these items.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. The Company's off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below, and letters of credit, of which $102 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007.  

 Certain municipalities issued municipal bonds on behalf of United to finance the construction of improvements at airport-related facilities. The Company also leases facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport-related projects. At December 31, 2007, the Company guaranteed interest and principal payments on $270 million in principal of such bonds that were originally issued in 1992, subsequently refinanced in 2007, and are due in 2032 unless the Company elects not to extend its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the Company's Statements of Consolidated Financial Position in accordance with GAAP. The related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease, and the related rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. The annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above. For further details, see Note 15, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and UncertaintiesGuarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Financing," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Fuel Consortia. The Company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease  

54 

agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $890 million principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt. United's exposure is approximately $195 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Company's exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to 2028. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.  

 Debt Covenants. The Company was in compliance with the Amended Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2007. As part of the amendment to the credit facility completed in February 2007, several covenants were amended to provide the Company more flexibility. The Amended Credit Facility contains covenants that may limit the ability of United and the Guarantors to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends on or repurchase stock, make certain types of investments, pay dividends or other payments from United's direct or indirect subsidiaries, enter into transactions with affiliates, sell assets or merge with other companies, modify corporate documents or change lines of business. The Amended Credit Facility also requires compliance with certain financial covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants could result in a default under the Amended Credit Facility unless the Company were to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate or cure, any such default. Additionally, the Amended Credit Facility contains a cross-default provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed $50 million. A payment default could result in a termination of the Amended Credit Facility and a requirement to accelerate repayment of all outstanding facility borrowings. For further details about the Amended Credit Facility and the associated covenants, see Note 12, "Debt Obligations," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Future Financing. Subject to the restrictions of its Amended Credit Facility, the Company could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt, equity or equity-like securities, monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds. However, the availability and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or predicted. General economic conditions, poor credit market conditions and any adverse changes in the Company's credit ratings could adversely impact the Company's ability to raise capital, if needed, and could increase the Company's cost of capital.  

 Credit Ratings. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a corporate credit rating of B (outlook stable) from Standard & Poor's and a corporate family rating of B2 (outlook stable) from Moody's Investors Services. These ratings are unchanged from the ratings received upon the Company's exit from bankruptcy. These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels could restrict the availability and/or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Information  

 Foreign Operations. The Company's Statements of Consolidated Financial Position reflect material amounts of intangible assets related to the Company's Pacific and Latin American route authorities, and its operations at London's Heathrow Airport. Because operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact, and significantly impair, the value of our international route authorities. Significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on the Company's operating revenues and expenses and results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies  

 Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial statements.  

 Passenger Revenue Recognition. The value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders ("MCO's") is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. United records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as operating revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket expires. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date. Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is incurred. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Company's additional service to modify a previous reservation. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets expire after one year. MCO's can be either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after issuance. United records an estimate of tickets that have been used, but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors, as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results. United also records an estimate of MCO's that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the validity period based on historical results. Due to complex industry pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results.  

 Frequent Flyer Accounting. In accordance with fresh-start reporting, the Company revalued its frequent flyer obligation to estimated fair value at the Effective Date, which resulted in a $2.4 billion increase to the frequent flyer obligation. The Successor Company elected to change its accounting policy for its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program to a deferred revenue model. The Company believes that accounting for frequent flyer miles using a deferred revenue model is preferable, as it establishes a consistent valuation methodology for both miles earned by frequent flyers and miles sold to non-airline business partners.  

 Before the Effective Date, the Predecessor Company used the historical industry practice of accounting for frequent flyer miles earned on United flights on an incremental cost basis as an accrued liability and as advertising expense, while miles sold to non-airline business partners were accounted for on a deferred revenue basis. As of the Effective Date, the deferred revenue value of all frequent flyer miles are measured using equivalent ticket fair value as described below, and all associated adjustments are made to passenger revenues.  

 The deferred revenue measurement method used to record fair value of the frequent flyer obligation on and after the Effective Date was to allocate an equivalent weighted-average ticket value to each outstanding mile, based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed. Such value was estimated assuming redemptions on both United and other  

56 

participating carriers in the Mileage Plus program, and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the Company's operations, including North America, Atlantic, Pacific and Latin America.  

 Under the new method of accounting adopted for this program at the Effective Date, the Company reduced operating revenue by approximately $158 million in the eleven months ended December 31, 2006 to account for the effects of the program as compared to the reduction in revenues that would have been recognized using the Predecessor Company's accounting method. The Company's new accounting policy does not continue the use of the former incremental cost method, which impacted revenues and advertising expense under that prior policy. Assuming the use of the Predecessor Company's accounting for this program, for the eleven months ended December 31, 2006, the Company estimates that it would have recorded approximately $27 million of additional advertising expense.  

 The estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions, for which significant management judgment is required. For example, management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on United, versus on other airline partners. Since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on United and on other carriers can vary greatly, this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weighted-average ticket value from period to period.  

 Management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of Mileage Plus customers, who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles, each of which can have materially different estimated fair values. Such choices include different classes of service (first, business and several coach award levels), as well as different flight itineraries, such as domestic and international routings, and different itineraries within domestic and international regions of United's and other participating carriers' flight networks. Customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes, which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices, or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices. Management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior using limited data, which requires the use of significant judgment. Management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates, but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in material changes to deferred revenue balances, and to recognized revenue.  

 Management's estimate of the expected expiration of miles as of the fresh-start date, and for recognition of expiration post-emergence, also requires significant management judgment. For customer accounts which are inactive for a period of 36 consecutive months, it had been United's policy to cancel all miles contained in those accounts at the end of the 36 month period of inactivity. In early 2007, the Company announced that it was reducing the expiration period from 36 months to 18 months effective December 31, 2007. Under its deferred revenue accounting policy effective in 2006, the Company recognized revenue from expiration of miles by amortizing such estimated expiration over the 36 month expiration period. In 2007, the Company began to amortize revenue from the expiration of miles over an 18 month expiration period. Current and future changes to program rules and program redemption opportunities can significantly alter customer behavior from historical patterns with respect to inactive accounts. The change in the expiration period increased revenues by $246 million in 2007. Changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance, as well as recognized revenues from the program. A hypothetical 1% change in the Company's estimated expiration rate as of December 31, 2007 would have approximately a $21 million effect on the liability.  

 At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company's outstanding number of miles was approximately 488.4 billion and 508.8 billion, respectively. The Company estimates that approximately 416.6 billion of  

57 

the outstanding miles at December 31, 2007 will ultimately be redeemed based on assumptions as of December 31, 2007 and, accordingly, has recorded deferred revenue of $3.8 billion. At December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 1% change in the Company's outstanding number of miles or the weighted-average ticket value has approximately a $43 million effect on the liability.  

 Accounting for Long-Lived Assets. UAL's and United's net book value of operating property and equipment was $11.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and $11.5 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. In addition to the original cost of these assets, as adjusted by fresh-start reporting at February 1, 2006, their recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.  

 Except for the adoption of fresh-start reporting at February 1, 2006, whereby the Company remeasured long-lived assets at fair value, it is the Company's policy to record assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of United and the practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts, and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the Company's fleet plan and other relevant information. A one year increase in the average depreciable life of our flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $20 million.  

 In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The Company's policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is the difference between the asset's book value and fair market value. The Company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for its various aircraft with output from financial models used by the Company to make fleet and scheduling decisions. These models utilize projections on passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors, many of which require the exercise of significant judgment on the part of management. Changes in these projections may expose the Company to future impairment charges by raising the threshold which future cash flows need to meet. If a triggering event requiring impairment testing occurs, the Company also evaluates the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether the lives are still appropriate. Typically, the Company utilizes knowledge from personnel in its fleet planning and maintenance departments, along with other external factors, to determine whether the remaining useful lives are appropriate. See Note 2(g), "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOperating Property and Equipment," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's policies on accounting for long-lived assets.  

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"), the Company applies a fair value-based impairment test to the book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations in the period of recognition. The Company performed its annual  

58 

impairment test for its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2007 and 2006. These tests did not indicate any material impairment of these assets.  

 Upon the implementation of fresh-start reporting (see Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11Fresh-Start Reporting," in the  Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) the Company's assets, liabilities and equity were valued at their respective fair values. The excess of reorganization value over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill in the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Financial Position on the Effective Date. As discussed in Note 10, "Segment Information," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the entire goodwill amount of $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, has been allocated to the mainline reporting segment. In addition, the adoption of fresh-start reporting resulted in the recognition of $2.2 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  

 SFAS 142 requires that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company must perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the Company must record an impairment charge equal to such difference.  

 The Company assessed the fair value of its reporting units considering both the market and income approaches. Fair value is estimated under each approach and a weighted-average fair value is determined by applying an equal weighting to both approaches. The market approach utilizes quoted market prices, adjusted for control premium and other factors, and recent transaction values of peer companies to estimate fair value. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs, appropriate discount rates and other relevant factors. To estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets the Company used the market and income approaches, discussed above, and the cost method, which uses the concept of replacement cost as an indicator of fair value.  

 At December 31, 2007 and 2006, United recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $255 million for its London Heathrow slots, based upon its estimation of the fair value for those slots as of the adoption of fresh-start reporting on February 1, 2006. United, however, determined at fresh-start that its rights relating to its actual route authorities to Heathrow had a fair value of zero. The EU/U.S. open skies agreement is expected to directly impact the future value and expected lives of route authorities to Heathrow; however, there is no direct impact from the open skies agreement on airport slot rights, including those at Heathrow. The open skies agreement is also expected to provide United an opportunity to secure antitrust immunity for certain of its Star Alliance carrier relationships, and to provide United and other carriers with access to new markets in EU countries. In September 2007, the DOT granted United and bmi antitrust immunity. The immunity goes into effect at the same time as the open skies agreement between the U.S. and the EU in March of 2008. Because of the diverse nature of these potential impacts on United's business, the overall future impact of the EU agreement on United's business in the EU region cannot be predicted with certainty. United has concluded that, in certain circumstances, the open skies agreement could indirectly and adversely affect the fair value of its slot rights at Heathrow, and therefore has further concluded that the signing of the open skies agreement on April 30, 2007 constituted an indicator of impairment with respect to United's Heathrow slots intangible asset.  

59 

 In addition to the impairment tests discussed above, during the second quarter of 2007 United performed an impairment review of the Heathrow slots intangible asset and concluded that no impairment was indicated. Furthermore, no change was determined to be required to the fresh-start assignment of an indefinite life to this intangible asset. This interim test was performed due to a potential impairment indicator, as discussed above.  

 The implementation of the EU/U.S. open skies agreement, however, may result in a future determination that the Heathrow slots are impaired in whole or in part, or in a future determination that they should be reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets with amortization expense recognized thereon. Such future determination could result in material charges to earnings in those future periods.  

 Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting. The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions ("SFAS 106") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) ("SFAS 158"). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158, which requires the Company to recognize the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plan's funded status, in its Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. Under these accounting standards, other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees' approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. The Company has not been required to pre-fund its current and future plan obligations, which had resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below.  

 The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $56 million and $54 million, respectively, for the other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligation was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The difference between the plan assets and obligations has been recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. Detailed information regarding the Company's other postretirement plans, including key assumptions, is included in Note 9, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 The following provides a summary of the methodology used to determine the assumptions disclosed in Note 9, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans," in the  Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates were based on the construction of theoretical bond portfolios, adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the Company's future postretirement obligations. A yield curve was developed based on a subset of these bonds (those with yields between the 40th and 90th percentiles). The projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a present value developed, which was then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate.  

 Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. The Company's accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under SFAS 106 with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the corridor approach, amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is only required if, at the beginning of the year, the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense. The corridor approach is  

60 

intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year. Since the Company has elected not to apply the corridor approach, all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized and included in pension expense each year. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had unrecognized actuarial gains of $254 million and $120 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans.  

 Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets. At December 31, 2007, United and UAL each had valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets of approximately $1.8 billion. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period available under the tax law. Sources of future taxable income include future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable differences, taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies. These sources of positive evidence of realizability must be weighed against negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. A recent history of losses would make difficult a determination that a valuation allowance is not needed.  

 In forming a judgment about the future realization of our deferred tax assets, management considered both the positive and negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight to the negative evidence from our cumulative losses for recent years. Management will continue to assess this situation and make appropriate adjustments to the valuation allowance based on its evaluation of the positive and negative evidence existing at that time. We are currently unable to forecast when there will be sufficient positive evidence for us to reverse the remainder of the valuation allowances that we have recorded. Currently, any reversals of valuation allowance would first reduce goodwill and then reduce intangible assets. See Note 2(p), "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesNew Accounting Pronouncements," for information regarding the effect of changes to this method of accounting for valuation allowance reversals, if any, on the Company's results of operations and financial condition after it is required to adopt SFAS 141R on January 1, 2009. See Note 6, "Income Taxes," in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Forward-Looking Information  

 Certain statements throughout Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report are forward-looking and thus reflect the Company's current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are and will be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to United's operations and business environment that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.
