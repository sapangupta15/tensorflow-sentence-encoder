Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2011 was a solid year for Textron with revenue and segment profit growth of 7% and an increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations of 163%. Volume increased in most of our businesses, led by higher revenues at Cessna and military sales at Bell. During 2011, we continued to emphasize product development to position our businesses for future growth, which was evident from a 30% increase in our company-funded research and development expenditures. An analysis of our consolidated operating results is provided below and a more detailed analysis of our segments operating results is provided in the Segment Analysis section on pages 22 to 31.  

Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues increased $750 million, 7%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to an 8% increase in Manufacturing revenues with increases in the Cessna, Bell, and Industrial segments that were partially offset by lower revenues in the Textron Systems segment. The net revenue increase included the following factors:  

       Higher Cessna revenues of $427 million, primarily due to higher volume, largely due to the impact of higher Citation jet volume and the mix of light- and mid-size jets sold during the period;  

       Higher Bell revenues of $284 million, largely due to higher volume in our military programs, which included more deliveries of V-22 and H-1 aircraft; and  

       Increased Industrial segment revenues of $261 million, primarily due to higher volume of $138 million, mostly reflecting higher automotive industry demand, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $77 million, largely related to strengthening of the euro; partially offset by  

       Lower revenues at the Finance segment of $115 million, primarily attributable to the lower average finance receivable portfolio balance resulting from continued liquidation; and  

       Lower Textron Systems revenues of $107 million, primarily due to $140 million in lower volume in the UAS and Mission Support and Other product lines, partially offset by higher volume in the Land & Marine and Weapons and Sensors product lines of $28 million.  

Revenues increased $25 million in 2010, compared with 2009. This increase was due to significant revenue increases in the Industrial, Bell and Textron Systems segments that were largely offset by lower revenues in the Cessna and Finance segments. The net revenue increase included the following factors:  

       Higher revenues of $446 million in the Industrial segment, largely due to higher volume reflecting improvements in the automotive industry;  

       Higher Bell revenues of $399 million, primarily due to higher V-22 and H-1 volume and improved pricing in its commercial business; and  

       Increased Textron Systems revenues of $80 million, primarily due to higher UAS volume; partially offset by  

       Lower revenues at Cessna of $757 million, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume; and  

       Reduced Finance segment revenues of $143 million, largely due to lower average finance receivables resulting from the continued liquidation.

Cost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Manufacturing cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses together comprise our operating expenses. Changes in operating expenses are more fully discussed in our Segment Analysis below.  

Consolidated manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues was 83.3% and 83.5% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. On a dollar basis, consolidated cost of sales increased $703 million, 8%, in 2011, principally due to higher sales volume in the Cessna, Bell and Industrial segments. In 2011, gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to favorable product mix and improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volume at Cessna and Bell. These improvements were partially offset by a $64 million increase in engineering and development expenses throughout our manufacturing businesses and $60 million in charges at Textron Systems related to the impairment of certain intangible assets and severance costs. In 2011, on a consolidated basis, selling and administrative expense decreased $48 million, 4%, to $1.2 billion, compared with 2010, primarily due to $44 million in lower operating expense at the Finance segment, largely reflecting progress towards our exit from the non-captive commercial finance business, and a $23 million decrease in corporate expense, primarily due to the impact of changes in our stock price on compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher bid and proposal costs at Textron Systems in 2011.  

In 2010 and 2009, cost of sales as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues remained flat at 83.5%. On a dollar basis, cost of sales increased $137 million, 2%, in 2010, compared with 2009, principally due to the net sales volume changes in the Industrial, Bell and Cessna segments described above, as well as higher pension costs and inflation. In 2010, favorable conversion costs in the Bell and Industrial segments, resulting from improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes, were offset by increased conversion costs at Cessna. Conversion costs increased at Cessna as cost reduction activities, including workforce reductions and facility consolidations, did not fully offset the impact of lower production volumes. In 2010, selling and administrative expense decreased $107 million, 8%, to $1.2 billion, compared with 2009, primarily due to $41 million in lower expenses in the Finance segment reflecting lower compensation and related costs due to headcount reductions associated with our exit from the non-captive commercial finance business, $39 million of lower commissions primarily resulting from lower Cessna sales volume, and $27 million lower corporate expenses.  

Interest Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes interest for both the Finance and Manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated. Interest expense for the Finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest.  

Our consolidated interest expense decreased $24 million, 9%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to a decrease for the Finance group, largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the non-captive portfolio. In 2010, consolidated interest expense decreased $39 million, 13%, compared with 2009, primarily due to a $63 million decrease for the Finance group, largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the non-captive portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense for the Manufacturing group of $24 million, primarily due to the full-year impact in 2010 of convertible notes issued in May 2009.

Provision for Losses on Finance Receivables  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The provision for loan losses decreased $131 million in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a decline in new troubled accounts in the Finance segments non-captive portfolio during 2011 and a $36 million reversal of the allowance for losses related to one significant Timeshare account. In 2010, the provision decreased $124 million from 2009, primarily due to a decline in the accounts identified as nonaccrual during the year.  

Valuation Allowance on Transfer of Golf Mortgage Portfolio to Held for Sale  

On a periodic basis, we evaluate our liquidation strategy for the non-captive finance portfolios as we continue to execute our exit plan. In connection with this evaluation, we also review our definition of the foreseeable future. Due to the relative stability of the golf market through the end of 2011, we believe that the foreseeable future now can be extended to a period of one to two years as opposed to the six- to nine-month period we previously used. Based on this change, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio for investment for the foreseeable future, and, accordingly, transferred $458 million of the remaining Golf Mortgage finance receivables, net of an $80 million allowance for loan losses, from the held for investment classification to the held for sale classification. These finance receivables were recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer, resulting in a $186 million charge recorded to Valuation allowance on transfer of Golf Mortgage portfolio to held for sale. 

Special Charges  

There were no amounts recorded within special charges in 2011. In 2010 and 2009, special charges included restructuring charges related to a global restructuring program that totaled $99 million and $237 million, respectively, primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business. This restructuring program primarily included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of certain operations throughout the company. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we initiated the final series of restructuring actions under this program, which included workforce reductions in the Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments and at Corporate, along with the decision to exit a plant in the Industrial segment. Upon the completion of this program at the end of 2010, we had terminated approximately 12,100 positions worldwide representing approximately 28% of our global workforce since the inception of the program and had exited 30 leased and owned facilities and plants.  

In 2010, special charges also included a $91 million non-cash pre-tax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the Statement of Operations as a result of substantially liquidating a Canadian Finance entity. In 2009, special charges also include a goodwill impairment charge of $80 million in the Industrial segment.  

Other Losses (Gains), net  

In 2011, other losses (gains), net includes $55 million in losses on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes which was largely offset by a $52 million gain from the collection on notes receivable in connection with the disposition of the Fluid & Power business in 2008 as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, we recorded a $50 million gain on the sale of assets related to CESCOM.  

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)  

Our effective rate was 28.1% in 2011, (6.4)% in 2010 and (51.0)% in 2009, and generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to certain earnings from our operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective rate impact in the periods presented include primarily Canada and China. We have not provided for U.S. taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. Our effective rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our U.S. and foreign operations. For a full reconciliation of our effective rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Analysis  

We operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: Cessna, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Finance. Segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. Segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses and special charges. The measurement for the Finance segment excludes special charges and includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest expense.  

In our discussion of comparative results for the Manufacturing group, changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume, pricing, foreign exchange and acquisitions. Additionally, changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix, inflation and cost performance. Volume changes in revenue represent increases/decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided. Pricing represents changes in unit pricing. Foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. Acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months. For segment profit, mix represents a change due to the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins. Inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension or other costs. Cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.  

Approximately 31% of our revenues were derived from contracts with the U.S. Government. For our segments that have significant contracts with the U.S. Government, we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume, changes in program performance or changes in contract mix. Changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract. Changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. Changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes.  

Cessna  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessna Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessnas revenues increased $427 million, 17%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher Citation jet volume and the mix of light- and mid-size jets sold during the period, which had a $262 million impact, higher pre-owned aircraft volume of $76 million reflecting improved market demand and higher aftermarket volume of $62 million, in part due to continued investment in additional service offerings. We delivered 183 Citation jets in 2011, compared with 179 jets in 2010. During 2011, the portion of Cessnas revenue derived from aftermarket sales and services represented 24% of Cessnas revenues, compared with 26% in the corresponding period of 2010.  

22  

Table of Contents 

Cessnas operating expenses increased by $338 million, 13%, in 2011, compared with 2010, principally due to higher sales volume, which resulted in a $271 million increase in direct material costs and a $27 million increase in manufacturing overhead. Operating expenses also increased due to higher engineering and development expenses of $28 million, primarily due to new product development. Cost inflation was offset by a $45 million favorable benefit related to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories. In 2011, Cessna had a LIFO benefit of $22 million resulting from operational improvements that led to a reduction in inventory levels, compared with expense of $23 million in 2010.  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessnas revenues decreased $757 million, 23%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to lower volume of Citation jets, reflecting the continued downturn in the business jet market attributable to the economic recession. We delivered 179 Citation jets in 2010, compared with 289 jets in 2009. Increased aircraft utilization and our investment in additional service capacity during 2010 contributed to increased aftermarket volume as Cessnas aftermarket revenues increased by $80 million, 14%, from 2009.  

Operating expenses decreased by $530 million, 17%, in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to a decline in direct material and labor costs, principally as a result of the reduced volume. During 2010, Cessnas cost reduction activities were not able to fully offset the lower volume.  

Cessna Segment Profit (Loss)  

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessnas segment profit increased $89 million in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher volume of $85 million. Segment profit was also impacted by the following contributing factors included within the Other line:  

       $28 million in higher engineering and development expenses, primarily due to new product development;  

       $22 million in cost improvements realized during the period, which were driven by factory efficiencies due to higher production volume; and  

       $16 million in lower pre-owned aircraft write-downs.  

In addition, cost inflation was offset by a $45 million favorable LIFO benefit discussed above.  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

23  

Table of Contents 

Cessnas segment profit decreased $227 million, 115%, in 2010, compared with 2009, due to the $253 million impact from lower volume, a nonrecurring $50 million gain on the 2009 sale of CESCOM assets and $19 million of inflation, net of higher pricing, partially offset by improved performance of $95 million. The improved performance included the following contributing factors:  

       $57 million in lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses;  

       $48 million in lower inventory reserves and pre-owned aircraft write-downs; and  

       $19 million in lower tooling costs; partially offset by  

       $49 million in lower deposit forfeiture income due to fewer order cancellations in 2010.  

Cessna Backlog  

Cessnas backlog decreased $1.0 billion, 35%, in 2011 and $2.0 billion, 40%, in 2010, mainly attributable to deliveries in excess of new orders and canceled Citation jet orders.  

Bell  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bell manufactures helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and provides services for military and/or commercial markets. Bells major U.S. Government programs at this time are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters, which are both in the production stage and represent a significant portion of Bells revenues from the U.S. Government. During 2011, we have continued to ramp up production and deliveries to meet customer schedule requirements for these programs.  

Bell Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells revenues increased $284 million, 9%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher volume, which included the following factors:  

       $225 million increase in volume related to the V-22 program, primarily reflecting higher deliveries. Bell delivered 34 V-22 aircraft in 2011, compared with 26 deliveries in 2010;  

       $74 million increase in other military volume, primarily reflecting higher H-1 deliveries, with 25 H-1 aircraft delivered in 2011, compared with 18 aircraft in 2010; this increase is net of a $55 million decrease in aftermarket volume, largely due to the completion of several non-recurring programs in 2010; and a  

       $41 million decrease in commercial volume, primarily reflecting lower deliveries. Bell delivered 125 commercial aircraft in 2011, compared with 131 aircraft in 2010.  

24  

Table of Contents 

Bells operating expenses increased $190 million, 7%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher sales volume discussed above, partially offset by improved cost performance. Improved cost performance was primarily related to our military programs due to efficiencies realized through our production ramp-up as described below.  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells revenues increased $399 million, 14%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to higher volume, which included the following factors:  

       $230 million increase in volume related to the V-22 program, primarily reflecting higher deliveries. Bell delivered 26 V-22 aircraft in 2010, compared with 20 deliveries in 2009;  

       $113 million increase in other military volume, primarily reflecting higher H-1 deliveries, with 18 H-1 aircraft delivered in 2010, compared with 9 deliveries in 2009; this increase is net of a $28 million impact from revenues recognized in 2009 on the canceled Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter Program; and an  

       $11 million decrease in commercial volume, largely related to lower commercial aircraft deliveries. Bell delivered 131 commercial aircraft in 2010, compared with 153 aircraft in 2009.  

Commercial revenues increased despite lower volume, largely due to improved pricing in 2010, which is included in the Other line.  

Bells operating expenses increased 11% in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to the higher net sales volume, partially offset by improved cost performance. Improved performance was primarily related to the V-22 and H-1 programs and unfavorable adjustments recorded in 2009 for the 429 program as discussed below, partially offset by $14 million in higher research and development costs.  

Bell Segment Profit  

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells segment profit increased $94 million, 22%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to improved program performance of $109 million, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of military and commercial aircraft sold during the period. Bells improved performance included the following:  

       $122 million resulting from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our military programs, resulting from efficiencies realized in connection with the ramp up of production lines; partially offset by a  

       $30 million unfavorable net change in program profit adjustments; this change was largely due to a $21 million adjustment recognized in 2010 related to the recognition of profit on the H-1 and V-22 programs for reimbursement of prior year costs.

Table of Contents 

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells segment profit increased $123 million, 40%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to improved performance of $106 million and higher pricing, net of inflation of $23 million. Sales volume did not have a significant net impact on segment profit due to the mix of commercial and military aircraft sold. The improved performance was largely due to the following factors:  

       $73 million attributable to the V-22 and H-1 programs, resulting from a $38 million favorable impact from efficiencies realized in connection with the ramp-up of production lines, $21 million in profit recognized in the second quarter of 2010 related to the reimbursement of prior year costs and $14 million of lower material costs; and an  

       $18 million net improvement from unfavorable adjustments recorded in 2009 for the 429 program that did not occur in 2010; partially offset by  

       $14 million in higher research and development costs.  

Bell Backlog  

Bells backlog increased $873 million in 2011, 13%, reflecting orders in excess of deliveries. In 2010, Bells backlog increased $281 million, 5%, largely related to the V-22 and H-1 programs, partially offset by a decline in commercial backlog reflecting deliveries in excess of new orders.  

Textron Systems  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As Textron Systems sells many of its products to the U.S. Government, its business environment continues to be shaped by policy and budget decisions determined by the U.S. Government. Recent actions of the President and Congress indicate an ongoing emphasis on federal budget deficit reduction, and budget decisions by the President and Congress may considerably reduce discretionary spending, of which defense constitutes a significant share. Based on the continued deterioration of this environment, the results of our annual operating plan review, which included updated long-range forecast estimates, and the loss of certain contracts, we determined that an indicator of potential asset impairment existed in the fourth quarter, requiring us to perform impairment tests. Based on our analysis, we determined that certain intangible assets were impaired and recorded a $41 million pre-tax impairment charge to write down intangible assets primarily related to customer agreements and contractual relationships associated with AAI-Logistics & Technical Services and AAI-Test & Training businesses. 

Also, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we initiated a workforce reduction at Textron Systems to streamline our cost structure that will eliminate over 10% of the segments workforce in 2012. This reduction is intended to improve our ability to efficiently execute and compete for potentially fewer opportunities with the Department of Defense and other customers. We recorded a $19 million charge primarily for severance costs related to this action. 

Textron Systems Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

26  

Table of Contents 

Revenues at Textron Systems decreased $107 million, 5%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to lower volume, reflecting the following changes:  

       Lower UAS volume of $84 million, largely due to lower deliveries and to the timing of revenues from various programs, and  

       Lower Mission Support and Other product line volume of $56 million, largely due to the completion of several test and training programs and lower intelligence systems volume; partially offset by  

       Higher Land & Marine volume of $18 million, primarily related to Armored Security Vehicles; and  

       Higher Weapons and Sensors revenues of $10 million, largely due to higher Sensor Fuzed Weapon volume.  

Textron Systems operating expenses decreased $18 million, 1%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to the lower volume, which was partially offset by the $41 million intangible asset impairment charge and $19 million, primarily in severance costs related to the workforce reduction.  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues at Textron Systems increased $80 million, 4%, in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to a $151 million increase in our UAS product line revenues, primarily due to higher volume, partially offset by a $55 million decrease in our Land and Marine Systems and Weapons and Sensors product lines. Textron Systems operating expenses increased $90 million, 5%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net sales volume and inflation, mostly due to higher pension costs.  

Textron Systems Segment Profit  

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Segment profit at Textron Systems decreased $89 million, 39%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to the impact of lower volume described above and mix, along with the $41 million intangible asset impairment charge and approximately $19 million in severance costs related to the workforce reduction included in the Other line.  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Segment profit at Textron Systems decreased $10 million in 2010, 4%, compared with 2009, as the $26 million impact of the higher UAS volume was offset by a $19 million impact from lower volumes in the Land and Marine Systems and Weapons and Sensors product lines and $14 million in inflation, primarily due to higher pension costs.

Industrial  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Industrial Revenues and Operating Expenses  

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Industrial segment sales increased $261 million, 10%, in 2011 from 2010. Volume increased and mix improved largely due to a $117 million increase in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line, reflecting higher automotive industry demand, and $21 million in the Other Industrial product lines, largely related to the Powered Tools, Testing and Measurement Equipment product line reflecting higher sales in North America and Europe. The favorable foreign exchange impact was primarily related to strengthening of the euro, which mostly impacted the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line. Higher Other Industrial revenues of $78 million included a $27 million impact from acquisitions and improved pricing of $20 million, in addition to the higher volume.  

Operating expenses for the Industrial segment increased $221 million, 9%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to a $115 million increase in direct material costs due to higher sales volume, a $68 million impact from foreign exchange related to strengthening of the euro, and $40 million in inflation for direct materials related to various commodity and material components throughout the segment.  

Factors contributing to the 2010 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Industrial segment sales increased $446 million, 21%, in 2010 from 2009. Volume increased largely due to $387 million in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line, reflecting improvements in the automotive industry, and $86 million in the Other Industrial product lines. The unfavorable foreign exchange impact was primarily related to weakening of the euro.  

The Industrial segments operating expenses increased $311 million, 15%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to higher sales volumes and inflation, partially offset by improved cost performance, largely due to the significant efforts made in 2009 to reduce costs through workforce reductions and other initiatives.

Industrial Segment Profit  

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Industrial segment profit increased $40 million, 25%, in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to a $34 million impact from improved performance and a $31 million impact from higher volume, as described above, partially offset by inflation, net of pricing of $35 million. Performance was favorable for the period due to continued cost reduction activities and improved manufacturing leverage resulting from higher volume. Inflation, net of pricing was primarily due to higher direct material costs for commodity and material components that exceeded related price increases, principally in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line.  

Factors contributing to 2010 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Industrial segment profit increased $135 million, 500%, in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to the $127 million impact from higher volume and $76 million in improved performance, partially offset by inflation in excess of higher pricing of $59 million. The improved cost performance in 2010 was largely due to the significant efforts made in 2009 to reduce costs through workforce reductions and other initiatives, along with improved manufacturing leverage due to higher volume.  

Finance  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our plan to exit the non-captive commercial finance business of our Finance segment is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales. Depending on market conditions, we expect continued progress in liquidating the remaining $950 million in the non-captive portfolio over the next several years.  

Finance Revenues  

Finance segment revenues decreased $115 million, 53%, in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily attributable to the impact of a $1.8 billion lower average finance receivable balance.  

In 2010, Finance segment revenues decreased $143 million, 40%, compared with 2009, primarily due to the $141 million impact from a lower average finance receivable balance of $1.8 billion and lower servicing fees, investment and other income, along with $54 million in lower gains on debt extinguishments. These reductions were partially offset by an $81 million impact from lower net portfolio losses, primarily as a result of $40 million in lower impairment charges in the Structured Capital portfolio, $23 million in gains on the sale of two Distribution Finance portfolios in 2010 and a $21 million decrease in discounts taken on the sale or early termination of finance assets associated with the liquidation of Distribution Finance receivables, partially offset by an $11 million increase in impairment charges on owned aircraft that are subject to operating lease or have been repossessed.

Finance Segment Loss  

Finance segment loss increased $96 million, 41%, in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the following factors:  

       $186 million valuation allowance recorded on the transfer of the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification during the fourth quarter of 2011; and  

       $61 million reduction in interest margin resulting from the lower average finance receivable balance; partially offset by  

       $131 million in lower provision for loan losses, primarily the result of a decline in new troubled accounts in the non-captive portfolio during 2011 and a $36 million reversal of the allowance for losses related to one significant Timeshare account; and  

       $44 million in lower administrative expenses, primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with a workforce reduction and other cost reductions related to the exit of the non-captive business.  

In 2010, the Finance segment loss decreased by $57 million, 19%, compared with 2009, primarily due to the following factors:  

       $124 million in lower provision for loan losses, primarily due to a decline in the accounts identified as nonaccrual during the year;  

       $81 million in lower portfolio losses, net of gains;  

       $41 million in lower operating and administrative expenses, primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with the workforce reduction; and  

       $28 million in lower securitization losses, net of gains; partially offset by  

       $54 million in lower gains on debt extinguishments;  

       $52 million reduction in interest margin resulting from the lower average finance receivable balance and a $26 million impact related to variable rate receivable interest rate floors;  

       $39 million impact from lower servicing fees, investment and other income; and  

       $32 million impact from lower interest rate on debt and lower accretion of the valuation allowance on finance receivable held for sale.  

Finance Portfolio Quality  

The following table reflects information about the Finance segments credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics above. Finance receivables held for sale in the non-captive portfolio totaled $418 million at the end of 2011, compared with $413 million at the end of 2010, as the transfer of the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification was largely offset by sales and liquidations. This transfer also resulted in an $80 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. At the end of 2011, finance receivables reported in the above table included $532 million of finance receivables held for investment in the non-captive portfolio, reflecting a $1.3 billion reduction from the 2010 year-end balance for this portfolio, primarily due to liquidations and the transfer of the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio.  

30  

Table of Contents 

Nonaccrual finance receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three months, unless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful as well as accounts whose credit quality indicators other than delinquency suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful. Nonaccrual finance receivables decreased $529 million, 62%, from the year-end balance, primarily due to the following reductions:  

       $219 million in the Golf Mortgage portfolio, primarily due to the transfer of the remaining portfolio to the held for sale classification; and  

       $215 million in the Timeshare portfolio, largely due to the resolution of several significant accounts and cash collections on several other accounts.  

These factors were also the primary reason for the improvement in the 60+ days contractual delinquency amount.  

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the nonaccrual finance receivables by product line, along with a summary of finance receivables held for investment based on our internally assigned credit quality indicators.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron Inc. consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Cessna, Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments. The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of TFC, its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by Textron Inc. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage. We believe that with our existing cash and equivalents, along with the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations, we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs.  

In 2011, Textron Inc. entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, up to $200 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit. At December 31, 2011, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility, and there were $38 million of letters of credits issued against it.  

We maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. In September 2011, we issued $250 million in 4.625% notes due 2016 and $250 million in 5.950% notes due 2021 under this registration statement.

Table of Contents 

In September 2011, we announced a cash tender offer for any and all of the outstanding convertible notes. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, for each $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes tendered, we paid the holder $1,524 plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the October 13, 2011 settlement date. In the aggregate, the holders validly tendered $225 million principal amount, or 37.5%, of the convertible notes. Subsequent to the tender offer, we also purchased $151 million principal amount of the convertible notes in a small number of privately negotiated transactions and retired another $8 million related to a holder-initiated conversion in the fourth quarter of 2011. By the end of 2011, we had paid approximately $580 million in cash related to these transactions and had reduced the principal amount of the convertible notes by 64%. At December 31, 2011, $216 million principal amount of convertible notes were outstanding. For at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2011, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price for the convertible notes of $17.06 per share. Accordingly, the remaining notes are convertible at the holders option through March 31, 2012. We may deliver shares of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes. We intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash. We have continued to classify these convertible notes as long term based on our intent and ability to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year through the use of various funding sources available to us.  

During 2011, we reduced our total finance receivable portfolio by $1.7 billion primarily through liquidations, mark-to-market adjustments on certain portfolios and impairments. These finance receivable reductions occurred in both the non-captive and captive finance portfolios, but were primarily driven by the non-captive portfolio in connection with our exit plan, including $576 million and $495 million in the Timeshare and Golf Mortgage product lines, respectively. Depending on market conditions, we expect continued progress in liquidating the remaining $950 million in the non-captive portfolio over the next several years.  

Manufacturing Group Cash Flows  

Cash flows from continuing operations for the Manufacturing group as presented in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash flows from operating activities increased in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher earnings for the Manufacturing group. In addition, cash payments related to the restructuring program that we substantially completed at the end of 2010 decreased to $38 million in 2011, from $58 million in 2010 and $132 million in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by $225 million in higher cash contributions made to our pension plans, as we made $642 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2011, compared with $417 million in contributions in 2010.  

Investing cash flows in 2011, 2010 and 2009 primarily included capital expenditures of $423 million, $270 million, and $238 million, respectively, as we increased investment in the areas of new product development and cost productivity improvements.  

In 2011, financing activities primarily consisted of $580 million in payments related to the purchase and cancellation of convertible notes that were originally issued in 2009, as described above, and $175 million in intergroup financing for our Finance Group, partially offset by $496 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes. We used significantly more cash for financing activities in 2010, compared with 2009, largely due to the repayment of $1.2 billion on our bank credit lines in 2010 that we had drawn on in 2009.  

Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $22 million, $22 million and $21 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

Capital Contributions Paid To and Dividends Received From the Finance Group  

Under a Support Agreement between Textron Inc. and TFC, Textron Inc. is required to maintain a controlling interest in TFC. The agreement also requires Textron Inc. to ensure that TFC maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than $200 million. Cash contributions paid to TFC to maintain compliance with the Support Agreement and dividends paid by TFC to Textron Inc. are detailed below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

32  

Table of Contents 

An additional cash contribution of $240 million was paid to TFC on January 17, 2012 as required by the Support Agreement, and on January 20, 2012, TFC paid an additional $172 million in dividends to Textron Inc.  

Due to the nature of these contributions, we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the Manufacturing group in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Capital contributions to support Finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities. The Finance groups net income (loss) is excluded from the Manufacturing groups cash flows, while dividends from the Finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the Manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment.  

Finance Group Cash Flows  

The cash flows from continuing operations for the Finance group are summarized below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash flows from operating activities improved in 2011 largely due to $65 million in tax refunds, net of payments received in 2011. In 2010, the Finance Group had $101 million in tax payments, net of refunds, primarily attributable to the settlement of the IRSs challenge of tax deductions we took in prior years for certain leverage lease transactions; in 2009, tax refunds, net of payments totaled $75 million.  

Cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations, which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years. Finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled $1.8 billion in 2011, $3.0 billion in 2010 and $5.4 billion in 2009. Cash outflows for originations declined to $0.5 billion in 2011 from $0.9 billion in 2010 and $3.7 billion in 2009. These decreases are largely due to our ongoing exit from the non-captive business.  

In 2011 and 2010, financing activities include repayments of $1.4 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, against the outstanding balance on TFCs bank line of credit that we had drawn down in 2009. In October 2011, we paid off and elected to terminate this bank line of credit. As we liquidate the non-captive business, we have continued to pay down our debt with principal payments on short- and long-term debt of $0.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $4.5 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $0.4 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively.  

TFC borrowed funds from Textron Inc. in 2011, 2010 and 2009, with interest, to pay down maturing debt. As of December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, the outstanding balance due to Textron Inc. for these borrowings was $490 million and $315 million, respectively.  

Consolidated Cash Flows  

The consolidated cash flows from continuing operations, after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups, are summarized below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash flow from operating activities increased in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher earnings for the Manufacturing group. In addition, cash payments related to the restructuring program that we substantially completed at the end of 2010 decreased to $44 million in 2011, from $72 million in 2010 and $144 million in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by $225 million in higher cash pension contributions made on behalf of the Manufacturing group with $642 million in contributions in 2011, compared with $417 million in contributions in 2010.

Table of Contents 

Cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations, which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years. Finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled $1.2 billion in 2011, $2.2 billion in 2010 and $4.6 billion in 2009. Cash outflows for originations declined to $0.2 billion in 2011 from $0.5 billion in 2010 and $3.0 billion in 2009. These decreases are largely due to our ongoing exit from the non-captive business.  

We also used more cash for investing activities in the current year due to higher capital expenditures, which totaled $423 million, $270 million, and $238 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as we increased investment in the areas of new product development and cost productivity improvements.  

In 2011 and 2010, financing activities include repayments of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, against the outstanding balance on our bank line of credit that we had drawn down in 2009. We also made principal payments on short-and long-term debt of $0.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $5.8 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These reductions were largely related to the liquidation of the non-captive business and debt maturities. In 2011, financing activities include $580 million in payments related to the purchase of convertible notes that were originally issued in 2009. Cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $0.9 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively.  

Captive Financing and Other Intercompany Transactions  

The Finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the Finance groups statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing groups statement of cash flows, the cash received from the Finance group on the customers behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

Reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated Discontinued Operations Cash Flows  

Cash flows from discontinued operations in 2009 primarily include approximately $280 million in after-tax net proceeds upon the sale of HR Textron, partially offset by $69 million in tax payments related to the sale of the Fluid & Power business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning these dispositions.

Contractual Obligations  

Manufacturing Group  

The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Manufacturing group as of December 31, 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) We maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. Our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table. In 2012, we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $150 million and approximately $25 million in the Retirement Account Plan. Based on our current assumptions, which may change with changes in market conditions, our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2013 through 2016 are estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $400 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.  

 (2) Other long-term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011, representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. The timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. Other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.  

 (3) Operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases.  

 (4) Purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. Approximately 35% of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. Government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

Finance Group  

The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Finance group as of December 31, 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the Finance group, and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests.  

 (2) Interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt. They do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates, which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt.  

On December 31, 2011, the Finance group also had $316 million in other liabilities, primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses, that are payable within the next 12 months.  

Critical Accounting Estimates  

To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes other significant accounting policies.  

Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables Held for Investment  

Finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses. We maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on managements evaluation and analysis by product line. For larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired, including large accounts in homogeneous portfolios, a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value with either a) the expected future cash flows, discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate; or b) the fair value, if the finance receivable is collateral dependent. The expected future cash flows consider collateral value; financial performance and liquidity of our borrower; existence and financial strength of guarantors; estimated recovery costs, including legal expenses; and costs associated with the repossession/foreclosure and eventual disposal of collateral. When there is a range of potential outcomes, we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence.  

The evaluation of our portfolios is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral, which may differ from actual results. While our analysis is specific to each individual account, certain critical factors are included in this analysis for each product line, which are discussed in detail in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also establish an allowance for losses by product line to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio. For homogeneous portfolios, including Aviation and Golf Equipment, the allowance is established as a percentage of non-recourse finance receivables, which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves. The percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience, current delinquency and default trends, collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends. For non-homogeneous portfolios, such as Timeshare, the allowance is established as a percentage of watchlist balances, which represents a combination of assumed default likelihood and loss severity based on historical experience, industry trends and collateral values. We classify accounts as watchlist based on credit quality indicators discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

Finance Receivables  

Finance receivables are classified as held for investment when we have the intent and the ability to hold the receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. Our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, contractual duration, type of collateral, credit strength of the borrowers, interest rates and perceived marketability of the receivables. On an ongoing basis, these factors, combined with our overall liquidation strategy, determine which finance receivables we have the intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which finance receivables we will hold for sale. Our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value and/or marketability of our finance receivables. A change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables.  

If we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future, until maturity or payoff, the finance receivables are transferred to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time. Conversely, if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity, these receivables would be designated as held for sale, and a valuation allowance would be established at that time, if necessary. At December 31, 2011, if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale, a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements. See page 68 in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the finance receivables held for investment, excluding leases that currently are not recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. There are no active, quoted market prices for our finance receivables. The estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction, which includes both the sale of pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans. The models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return, financing cost, capital structure and/or discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses, payment rates and expectations of borrowers ability to make scheduled balloon payments on a timely basis. Where available, assumptions related to the expectations of current market participants are compared with observable market inputs, including bids from prospective purchasers of similar loans and certain bond market indices for loans perceived to be of similar credit quality. Although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models, these inputs are not typically derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures, industries and collateral types. Therefore, all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment, which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants.  

See page 67 in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of changes in fair value and the classification of finance receivables for the past two years.  

Long-Term Contracts  

We make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long-term contracts. These contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed-price purchase options for additional products. We account for these long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases, includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years. We are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries.  

Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.  

37  

Table of Contents 

At the outset of each contract, we estimate the initial profit booking rate. The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract. Likewise, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate. When adjustments are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period.  

The following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the two years ended December 31, 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Goodwill  

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired. The reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit. In certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics.  

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that permits companies to perform a qualitative assessment based on economic, industry and company-specific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test for all or selected reporting units. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, companies are only required to perform Step 1 of the annual impairment test for a reporting unit if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the units fair value is less than its carrying amount. As permitted, we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reduce the costs associated with determining each reporting units fair value for the units where it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds its carrying amount.  

For the reporting units for which we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment, we performed a Step 1 analysis, which required us to calculate fair value of each reporting unit. If the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit is not impaired, and no further analysis is performed. Otherwise, the amount of the impairment must be determined in Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. In Step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  

Fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the units short- and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates, which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, current cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. The revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. The long-term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. We utilize a weighted-average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.  

Based on our annual review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the Step 1 impairment test in the foreseeable future.

Retirement Benefits  

We maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases. We evaluate and update these assumptions annually.  

To determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2011, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.84%, compared with 8.26% in 2010. In 2011 and 2010, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 90% of our total pension assets, was 8.00% and 8.50%, respectively. A 50-basis-point decrease in this long-term rate of return in 2011 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately $22 million.  

The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In 2011, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 5.71%, compared with 6.20% in 2010. For our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 5.75% in 2011, compared with 6.25% for 2010. A 50-basis-point decrease in this discount rate in 2011 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately $23 million.  

The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2011 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. The 2011 medical rate of 9% is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2021 and then remain at that level. The 2011 prescription drug rate of 9% is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2021 and then remain at that level. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of a one-percentage-point change in the cost trend rate.  

Warranty Liabilities  

We provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs, including parts and labor, for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years. A significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses. We also may incur costs related to product recalls. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold, historical costs per claim, contractual recoveries from vendors, and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, including production and warranty patterns for new models. During our initial aircraft model launches, we typically incur higher warranty-related costs until the production process matures, at which point warranty costs moderate. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant. Should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience, we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required.  

Income Taxes  

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years, available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. We recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense.  

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Interest and penalties are accrued, where applicable. We recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense. If we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations,

 new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.
