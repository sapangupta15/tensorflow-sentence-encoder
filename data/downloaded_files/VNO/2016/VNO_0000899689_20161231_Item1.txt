PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.7% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2016.  

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be named JBG SMITH Properties. Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company. The pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata 1:2 basis. The initial Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction. JBG has obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this transaction. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be completed.

· 20.2 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 36 properties;

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through: 

· maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. 

ACQUISITIONS 

There were no significant acquisitions during 2016.  

DISPOSITIONS 

On May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street for net proceeds of $127.4 million.

In connection therewith, the Skyline properties’ assets (approximately $236.5 million) and liabilities (approximately $724.4 million), were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $487.9 million. There was no taxable income related to this transaction.

The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion, of which $609,420,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016. 

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building at 512 West 22nd Street, along the western edge of the High Line in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% owned).

We are developing a 170,000 square foot office and retail building at 61 Ninth Avenue, located on the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan. In February 2016, the venture purchased an adjacent five story loft building and air rights in exchange for a 10% common and preferred equity interest in the venture valued at $19,400,000, which reduced our ownership interest to 45.1% from 50.1%. On December 21, 2016, the venture obtained a $90,000,000 construction loan. The loan matures in December 2020 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 3.05%. As of December 31, 2016, there was nothing drawn on this loan. The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $150,000,000, of which our share is $68,000,000.

At closing, the joint venture obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year extension options. The venture’s incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $60,000,000, of which our share is $30,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $20,833,000 has been expended, of which our share is $10,417,000. 

We are in the process of demolishing two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street, and will replace them in the future with a new 335,000 square foot Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street. The incremental development cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $170,000,000, of which $10,500,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016. 

In September 2016, a joint venture between the Related Companies and Vornado was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of office space and ancillary train hall retail. The joint venture will enter into a 99-year, triple-net lease and make a $230,000,000 contribution towards the construction of the train hall. Total costs for the redevelopment of the office and retail space are yet to be determined. 

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, including, in particular, the Penn Plaza District. 

There can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.  

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

Certain Activities 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by Vornado’s Board of Trustees without the vote of our shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately 4,225 employees, of which 284 are corporate staff.
