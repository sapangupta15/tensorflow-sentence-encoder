Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs, but as of December 2007, the Company did not have a significant position in derivative financial instruments. 

At December 2007, CSX had $106 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a $1 million change in interest expense.
