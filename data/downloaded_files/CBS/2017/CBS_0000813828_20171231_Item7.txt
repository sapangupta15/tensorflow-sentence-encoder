Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Overview

Business Overview and Strategy

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company continues to increase its investment in premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company’s content on multiple digital platforms, including the Company’s owned digital streaming services as well as third-party live television streaming offerings; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits. The Company’s continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide it with incremental advertising and non-advertising revenues.

Operational Highlights 2017 vs. 2016 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) See pages II-7 and II-8 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For 2017, revenues grew 4% to an all-time high of $13.69 billion, led by strong growth from affiliate and subscription fee revenues, which increased 26%, driven by higher station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues; Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event; and growth from new digital initiatives, including the Company’s owned streaming subscription services, CBS All Access and the Showtime digital streaming subscription service, and third-party live television streaming services. Growth in content licensing and distribution revenues also contributed to the revenue increase, and was driven by higher licensing sales. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenues, mainly resulting from the benefit to 2016 from the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS and record political advertising sales during the 2016 Presidential election cycle. 

II-4

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating income decreased 8% from 2016. Comparability of operating income was impacted by several discrete items in 2017 and 2016, including charges for pension settlements and restructuring activities. Adjusted operating income was down 1%, primarily due to a mix of lower-margin revenues in 2017 compared to 2016, as well as an increased investment in programming, which the Company expects to monetize in the future across multiple platforms and geographic regions. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 16% due to the lower operating income as well as charges in 2017 resulting from the enactment of federal tax legislation and the early extinguishment of debt. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 3%. 

Net earnings, which include the results of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio”) in discontinued operations, were $357 million in 2017 compared with $1.26 billion in 2016 and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $.88 in 2017 compared with $2.81 in 2016. Discontinued operations for 2017 includes a net loss of $105 million from the split-off of CBS Radio and a market value adjustment of $980 million recorded prior to the split-off to reduce the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”). (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.) Discontinued operations for 2016 includes an impairment charge at CBS Radio of $444 million. Adjusted net earnings decreased 3% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% to $4.40. Diluted EPS benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the shares retired as a result of the split-off of CBS Radio and the Company’s share repurchase program. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See pages II-7 and II-8 for details of the discrete items excluded from financial results, and reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 

The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $793 million in 2017, which included discretionary pension contributions of $600 million to prefund the Company’s qualified pension plans, compared with $1.45 billion in 2016. Free cash flow was $989 million for 2017 compared with $1.26 billion for 2016. These decreases were impacted by a decline in advertising revenues including from the benefit in 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50, and an increased investment in internally-produced television programming, partially offset by higher affiliate and subscription fee revenues. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow” on pages II-33 and II-34 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

Recent Developments

Special Committee to Evaluate Potential Combination with Viacom Inc.

On February 1, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors established a special committee of independent directors to evaluate a potential combination with Viacom Inc. There can be no assurance that this process will result in a transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur. 

Pension Settlement 

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company has permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately $800 million, representing approximately 20% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $352 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling $600 million to prefund its qualified pension plans.

Federal Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation containing significant changes to U.S. federal tax law (the “Tax Reform Act“), including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. The Company recorded a net provisional charge of $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an estimated tax impact of $407 million on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by an estimated benefit of $278 million to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduced corporate income tax rate. 

The final impacts of the Tax Reform Act may differ materially from the current estimates since all of the necessary information was not available, prepared or analyzed in sufficient detail to complete the assessment of the Tax Reform Act. In addition, future interpretive guidance issued by federal and state tax authorities may impact the provisional amount. The Company will complete its analysis of this provisional amount and finalize and record any adjustments to its estimates within one year from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act.

CBS Radio Separation

On November 16, 2017, the Company completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted 17.9 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 101.4 million shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio with Entercom. 

Share Repurchases

The following is a summary of the Company’s purchases of its Class B Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2017:

Debt

During 2017, the Company issued a total of $1.80 billion of senior debt at interest rates between 2.50% and 3.70%. The proceeds of these issuances were used to repay $400 million of senior notes which matured in July 2017 and to early redeem a total of $800 million of senior debt with interest rates of 4.625% and 5.75%. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including discretionary contributions to the Company’s qualified pension plans and the repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. The redemptions resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $49 million ($31 million, net of tax) for 2017.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

Results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included discrete items that were not part of the normal course of operations. The following tables present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of these discrete items, reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company.

Segments

CBS Corp. operates in the following four segments:

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, Network Ten, CBS Interactive, and CBS Films as well as the Company’s digital streaming services, CBS All Access and CBSN. Entertainment’s revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 67% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, and 55%, 53% and 51% to total segment operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

II-8

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, including its digital subscription streaming offering, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks’ revenues are generated primarily from affiliate and subscription fees and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 18%, 16% and 18% to consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and 35%, 33% and 37% to total segment operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster’s consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Atria Books. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 6% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, and 5% to total segment operating income in 2017 and 4% to total segment operating income in each of the years 2016 and 2015.

LOCAL MEDIA: The Local Media segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Local Digital Media, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales and retransmission fees. The Local Media segment contributed 12%, 14% and 12% to consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and 18%, 22%, and 19% to total segment operating income in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Consolidated Results of Operations—2017 vs. 2016 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2017, the 9% decrease in advertising revenues primarily reflects the benefit to 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks. CBS’s most recent Super Bowl broadcast was in 2016 and the next broadcast will be in 2019. The decline also reflects the benefit in 2016 from record political advertising sales during the 2016 Presidential election cycle. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising declined 2% in 2017, mainly as a result of lower ratings for the Company’s programming, which was partially offset by higher pricing. In addition, a majority of the CBS Television Network’s upfront advertising sales (“Upfront”) for the 2017/2018 television broadcast season are measured based on a live-plus-seven day viewing window, which began to benefit the Company’s advertising revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

In 2018, advertising revenues will benefit from political advertising sales from the U.S. midterm elections and the Company’s acquisition of Ten Network Holdings Limited (“Network Ten”) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The CBS Television Network’s Upfront for the 2017/2018 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2017 through the middle of September 2018, concluded with increases in pricing compared with the prior broadcast season, as well as a majority of agreements being based on a live-plus-seven day viewing window, which are each expected to benefit advertising revenues during the 2017/2018 broadcast season (See page I-2 for a description of the Upfront market). The advertising comparison in the second half of 2018 will be negatively affected by the broadcast of five Thursday Night Football games in 2017, which CBS will not broadcast in 2018. However, this will result in an improvement in the Company’s operating income margin. Overall advertising revenues for the Company will be dependent on ratings for its programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising

market, which is when advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming.

Content Licensing and Distribution

Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally-produced television programming; fees from the distribution of third-party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For 2017, the 8% increase in content licensing and distribution revenues reflected growth in both international and domestic licensing sales. The increase in domestic licensing sales was primarily driven by sales of NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and several titles from the CSI franchise. Internationally, the Company benefited from strong demand for its content during 2017, reflecting additional titles available for sale as a result of the Company’s recent increased investment in internally-produced series. 

Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of Company-owned television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. Unrecognized revenues attributable to signed license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $670 million and $749 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adoption of new Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance on January 1, 2018, discussed below, increases the amount of unrecognized revenues attributable to license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition to $1.33 billion. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 650 episodes of scripted original programming that had not yet been made available in the secondary domestic marketplace (See page II-55 for a description of the secondary marketplace).

Total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $4.06 billion and $3.82 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.85 billion in 2018, $1.03 billion in 2019, $626 million in 2020, $327 million in 2021, and $230 million in 2022 and thereafter. 

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), as well as for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); subscription fees for digital streaming services; fees received from third-party live television streaming offerings (“virtual MVPDs”); and revenues received for the distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. For 2017, the 26% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects revenues from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event, which contributed nine points of the growth. Underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenues increased 17%, led by 27% growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, and 98% growth from digital initiatives, including the Company’s owned streaming subscription services, CBS All Access and the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering, and virtual MVPDs. 

Over the next few years, the Company expects to benefit from the renewal of several of its agreements with station affiliates and MVPDs as well as from agreements with new distributors of live television streaming offerings. In addition, the Company’s existing agreements with station affiliates and MVPDs include annual contractual increases. Together, these factors are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees over the next several years.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Guidance 

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company will adopt new FASB guidance on the recognition of revenues which will impact the comparability of revenues during 2018. The adoption of this guidance will result in changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies primarily relating to two areas of its content licensing and distribution operations. First, revenues from certain distribution arrangements of third-party content will be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received by the Company, with a participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under current accounting guidance, such revenues are recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. This accounting change if adopted in 2017 would have increased 2017 revenues by approximately $275 million, with no impact on operating income. Second, revenues associated with the extension of an existing licensing arrangement, which are currently recognized upon the execution of such extension, will be recognized at a later date once the extension period begins. This change will result in quarterly fluctuations in the Company’s results; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operating income on an annual basis, since revenues from extensions executed each year approximate revenues from extensions for which the license period has begun. The Company will apply the modified retrospective method for the adoption of this guidance and therefore revenues for reporting periods prior to 2018 will not be affected. 

International Revenues

For 2017, international revenues increased 9% primarily as a result of higher television licensing sales. The Company generated approximately 15% and 14% of its total revenues from international regions in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, international revenues are expected to increase compared to the prior year as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Network Ten in the fourth quarter of 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired programs exhibited on television broadcast and cable networks, and television stations. For 2017, the 7% increase in programming expenses was driven by costs associated with Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event; CBS’s broadcast of the semifinals and finals of the NCAA Tournament, and an increased investment in cable programming. Costs in 2016 associated with CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50 partially offset these increases. 

II-11

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Production

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally-developed television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2017, the 8% increase in production expenses reflected an increased investment in internally-developed television series and higher costs associated with the increase in television licensing revenues. 

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television content, such as print and advertising. For 2017, the 1% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the mix of titles sold under television licensing arrangements. 

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company will adopt new FASB guidance on the recognition of revenues which will result in changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies relating to certain distribution arrangements of third-party content. Beginning in 2018, these revenues will be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received by the Company for such sale, with an associated participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under current accounting guidance, such revenues are recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of participations to the third party. This accounting change if adopted in 2017 would have increased 2017 participation, distribution and royalty expenses by approximately $275 million, with a corresponding increase in revenues.

Other

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For 2017, the 5% increase in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher compensation costs associated with the Company’s growth initiatives and increased costs resulting from a higher volume of book sales.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support. The 4% increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflected higher advertising and marketing costs, mainly to support the Company’s growth initiatives. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company will adopt new FASB guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (“net benefit cost”) which requires that the components of net benefit cost other than service cost be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company’s SG&A expenses for 2017 and 2016 will decrease by $89 million and $72 million, respectively. (See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.) 

Depreciation and Amortization

II-12

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Pension Settlement Charges

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company has permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately $800 million, representing approximately 20% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $352 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling $600 million to prefund its qualified pension plans.

During 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company paid a total of $518 million of lump-sum distributions in 2016 using its pension plan assets, representing 12% of the total obligations of its qualified pension plans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $211 million reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. 

Restructuring and Merger and Acquisition-Related Costs

During the year ended December 31, 2017, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $63 million, reflecting $54 million of severance costs and $9 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. These restructuring activities are expected to reduce the Company’s annual cost structure by approximately $50 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $30 million, reflecting $19 million of severance costs and $11 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $45 million, reflecting $24 million of severance costs and $21 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. 

As of December 31, 2017, the cumulative settlements for the 2017, 2016, and 2015 restructuring charges were $68 million, of which $45 million was for severance costs and $23 million related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. The Company expects to substantially utilize its restructuring reserves by the end of 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Reflects excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted FASB guidance which requires that the difference between the tax benefit from stock-based compensation expense and the deduction on the tax return be recognized within the income tax provision on the statement of operations. Previously, such difference was recognized in stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. This difference occurs because stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the grant-date fair value of the award, whereas the tax deduction is based on the fair value on the date the stock option is exercised or the RSU vests. This guidance requires the income statement classification to be applied prospectively, and therefore, excess tax benefits for prior periods remain classified in stockholders’ equity.

(b) For the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflects tax benefits from the resolution of certain state income tax matters. For the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflects a one-time tax benefit of $47 million associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016.

(c) Reflects the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. As a result of this tax law, the Company recorded a net provisional charge of $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an estimated tax impact of $407 million on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by an estimated benefit of $278 million to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 

For 2018, the Company’s annual effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% before any potential discrete items, including the tax impacts from stock-based compensation. This rate reflects a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018 as a result of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act.

For 2017, the decreases in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations of 16% and 7%, respectively, were driven by pension settlement charges of $352 million ($237 million, net of tax); in 2017 compared with $211 million ($130 million, net of tax) in 2016; a provisional charge of $129 million from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017; and a charge of $49 million ($31 million, net of tax) from the early extinguishment of debt. Diluted EPS from continuing operations benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s share repurchases and the shares retired as a result of the split-off of CBS Radio during the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations

On February 2, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Entercom to combine the Company’s radio business, CBS Radio, with Entercom in a merger effected through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which was tax-free to CBS Corp. and its stockholders. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

On November 16, 2017, the Company completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted 17.9 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 101.4 million shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Class A common stock upon completion of the merger. 

During the fourth quarter of 2017, upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded a net loss of $105 million calculated as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Net of a market value adjustment of $980 million recorded prior to the split-off.

The split-off was a tax-free transaction and therefore, there is no tax impact on the loss. 

In connection with the Company’s plan to dispose of CBS Radio, in October 2016, CBS Radio borrowed $1.46 billion through a $1.06 billion senior secured term loan due 2023 and the issuance of $400 million of 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2024 through a private placement.

The following tables set forth details of net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period, beginning with the first quarter of 2017, at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, the carrying value of CBS Radio was measured at the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom. As a result, the Company recorded a market value adjustment of $980 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio as follows:

Consolidated Results of Operations— 2016 vs. 2015 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2016, the 8% increase in advertising revenues was driven by CBS’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks; higher political advertising sales; and 3% growth in underlying network advertising. The increase in network advertising reflects higher pricing, including from increased demand, partially offset by lower ratings, including from the broadcast of NFL games.

Content Licensing and Distribution

For 2016, the 6% decrease in content licensing and distribution revenues primarily reflected lower domestic television licensing revenues compared with 2015, which included sales of NCIS, Elementary and CSI. A significant contributor to television licensing revenues in 2016 was the international licensing of five Star Trek series.

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

For 2016, the 9% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflected 35% growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, and revenues from the Company’s streaming subscription services, including CBS All Access and the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2015 from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao boxing event. 

International Revenues

International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues. The Company generated approximately 14% and 16% of its total revenues from international regions in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming

For 2016, the 2% increase in programming expenses was primarily driven by increased sports programming costs associated with the broadcast of NFL games, including Super Bowl 50, which was broadcast by CBS in 2016, partially offset by three fewer Thursday Night Football games than 2015. This increase was partially offset by costs in 2015 associated with Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao pay-per-view boxing event and lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series.

Production

For 2016, the 2% increase in production expenses reflected increased investment in internally developed television series, partially offset by lower expenses associated with the decrease in television licensing revenues.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

For 2016, the 5% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflected lower participations associated with lower licensing sales of the CSI franchise.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2016, the 8% increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflects incremental advertising, marketing and employee-related costs to support the Company’s growth initiatives, and higher pension and incentive compensation costs. 

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2016, the 4% decrease in depreciation and amortization was the result of intangibles and property and equipment that became fully amortized, and the sales of internet businesses in China.

Pension Settlement Charge

During 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company paid a total of $518 million of lump-sum distributions in 2016 using its pension plan assets, representing 12% of the total obligations of its qualified pension plans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $211 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. 

Restructuring Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $45 million, reflecting $24 million of severance costs and $21 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. 

Other Operating Items, Net

For 2015, other operating items, net included gains from the disposition of businesses in China.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net earnings from continuing operations for 2016 was comparable with 2015, as the increase in revenues was offset by the 2016 pension settlement charge of $211 million ($130 million, net of tax), and 2015 gains on the sales of internet businesses in China of $139 million ($131 million, net of tax). The 9% increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations was driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s share repurchases during 2016, which totaled $3.0 billion.

The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to the Company’s consolidated Net earnings is presented in Note 17 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

Entertainment (CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, Network Ten, CBS Interactive, and CBS Films)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2017 vs. 2016 

For 2017, the 3% increase in revenues was led by growth in affiliate and subscription fees and content licensing and distribution revenues. Affiliate and subscription fees grew 35% as a result of higher station affiliation fees and growth from digital initiatives, including CBS All Access and virtual MVPDs. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 10%, driven by the domestic licensing sales of NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and titles from the CSI franchise, and higher international licensing sales resulting from strong demand for the Company’s content internationally, due in part to increased investment in internally-produced series. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenues, mainly as a result of the benefit to 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50. 

Operating income increased 2% driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by an increased investment in programming, as well as other costs associated with the Company’s growth initiatives. For 2017 and 2016, restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

Results in 2018 are expected to benefit from continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, driven by the renewal of several of the Company’s agreements with its television station affiliates and annual contractual increases on multiyear agreements with television station affiliates. The revenue comparison in 2018 will be negatively affected by the broadcast of five Thursday Night Football games in 2017, which CBS will not broadcast in 2018. However, this will result in an improvement in the operating income margin. The revenue comparison will also be affected by the CBS Television Network’s 2017 broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner. Revenue comparisons will also be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of availability of television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. 

In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company will adopt new FASB guidance on the recognition of revenues, which will impact the comparability of Entertainment revenues during 2018. (See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.)

Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2017 vs. 2016

For 2017, the 16% increase in revenues was driven by Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event, growth from the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering and higher international licensing sales of Showtime content. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic licensing sales, primarily as a result of sales of several titles, including Penny Dreadful, in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, subscriptions totaled approximately 25 million for Showtime, the Company’s premium television network, and the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering combined, 52 million for CBS Sports Network and 30 million for Smithsonian Networks.

Operating income increased 4% driven by the revenue growth, which was significantly offset by higher costs associated with the pay-per-view boxing event and an increased investment in programming. Restructuring charges in 2016 primarily reflected severance costs.

2017 vs. 2016

For 2017, the 6% decrease in revenues was driven by lower advertising revenues, primarily reflecting the benefit to 2016 from record political advertising sales during the 2016 Presidential election cycle and CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50. This decrease was partially offset by growth in retransmission revenues and fees from virtual MVPDs. 

The decrease in operating income of 20% primarily reflected a decline in high-margin political advertising sales. For 2017 and 2016, restructuring charges reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

In 2018, advertising revenues are expected to benefit from increased political advertising sales associated with the U.S. midterm elections. Results in 2018 are also expected to benefit from continued growth in retransmission revenues, driven by the renewal of several of the Company’s agreements with MVPDs and annual contractual increases on multiyear agreements with MVPDs.

Cash Flows 

The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities. In 2017, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was driven by discretionary pension contributions of $600 million made during 2017 to prefund the Company’s qualified plans; a decline in advertising revenues including from the benefit in 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50; and an increased investment in internally-produced television programming. These decreases were partially offset by higher affiliate and subscription fee revenues. 

II-31

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In 2016, the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees and higher advertising revenues, including from the broadcast of Super Bowl 50, partially offset by increased investment in programming and higher payments for income taxes.

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating activities of CBS Radio. Operating activities from discontinued operations also included payments and refunds for tax matters in foreign jurisdictions related to previously disposed businesses that are accounted for as discontinued operations. 

Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in cash paid for income taxes in 2017 reflects a tax benefit from contributions of $600 million to prefund the Company’s qualified pension plans and a higher tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs, offset by the impact from the expiration of a tax law which benefited cash taxes for 2016. The increase in cash paid for income taxes for 2016 was driven by higher taxable income and a higher tax benefit in 2015 from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units. 

Cash taxes from continuing operations benefited from federal income tax refunds of $32 million in 2017, $90 million in 2016 and $169 million in 2015. Cash taxes for 2016 also included a one-time benefit of $47 million associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016.

For 2018, cash taxes are expected to be significantly lower than 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. However, a more precise estimate cannot currently be determined.

Investing Activities

Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and discretionary contributions to prefund the Company’s pension plans, and including capital expenditures. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. Free cash flow excludes discretionary contributions to prefund the Company’s pension plans because management assesses the Company’s ability to generate operating cash flows without considering the impact from discretionary pension contributions, and decisions regarding the timing of pension plan funding are not dependent on the level of operating cash flows generated during the period. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry. 

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

During 2017, the Company repurchased 16.2 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock under its share repurchase program for $1.05 billion, at an average cost of $64.70 per share. At December 31, 2017, $3.06 billion of authorization remained under the share repurchase program.

Also during 2017, the Company completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted 17.9 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 101.4 million shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.)

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For the year ended December 31, 2017, debt issuances, redemptions and repayments were as follows:

Debt Issuances

November 2017, $400 million 2.90% senior notes due 2023 

November 2017, $500 million 3.70% senior notes due 2028 

July 2017, $400 million 2.50% senior notes due 2023 

July 2017, $500 million 3.375% senior notes due 2028 

Debt Redemptions

November 2017, $500 million 5.750% senior notes due 2020 

July 2017, $300 million 4.625% senior notes due 2018 

Debt Repayments

July 2017, $400 million 1.950% senior notes due 2017, upon maturity 

The Company used the net proceeds from the 2017 issuances for the redemption and repayment of $1.20 billion of senior notes and for general corporate purposes, including discretionary contributions to the Company’s qualified pension plans and the repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. 

The early redemption of the $500 million 5.750% senior notes due April 2020 and the $300 million 4.625% senior notes due May 2018 resulted in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $49 million ($31 million, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During July 2016, the Company issued $700 million of 2.90% senior notes due 2027 and used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and the repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. During January 2016, the Company repaid its $200 million of outstanding 7.625% senior debentures upon maturity. 

At December 31, 2017, the Company’s scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial Paper

The Company had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its $2.50 billion commercial paper program of $679 million and $450 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, each with maturities of less than 90 days. The weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was 1.88% and 0.98% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Credit Facility

At December 31, 2017, the Company had a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires in June 2021. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company’s option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.

II-35

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 3.1x.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company’s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.

The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.49 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company’s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company’s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $2.49 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2017, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

The Company’s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for the Company’s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $1.60 billion is expected to come from the Company’s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had $3.06 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2017, payments due by period under the Company’s significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $7.30 billion for sports programming rights, $2.44 billion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and $672 million for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding capital leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases.

(f) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities; participations due to producers; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the estimated tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS over eight years.

The table above excludes $138 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation. 

In 2018, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $53 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2018, the Company expects to contribute approximately $49 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company’s portion of benefit payments due under these plans. 

Guarantees

The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $99 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Programming and Production Costs

Accounting for the Company’s television production costs requires management’s judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and timing of the expensing of these costs.

Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company performs a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of FCC licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company’s reporting units are one level below its operating segments, except for the Publishing reporting unit, which is the same as its operating segment because this operating segment has only one component. FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of 

II-38

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

all of the Company’s television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2017 the Company had eight reporting units with goodwill balances, and 14 television markets with FCC license book values. 

Television FCC Licenses— For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each market that management estimates has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In selecting markets for a qualitative assessment the Company also considers the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2017 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for 11 television markets. For each of these markets, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For FCC licenses in the remaining television markets, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a five-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. The overall market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry. The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television station for 2017 were 7.5% and 2.0%, respectively.

For the three television markets for which a quantitative test was performed in 2017, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in each market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required. The estimated fair value of one television market, which had a carrying value of FCC licenses of $74 million, exceeded its carrying value by 6%. In each of the remaining television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values by more than 10%. 

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to the Company’s current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in any local television advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of the local television advertising revenues; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. 

II-39

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill—For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. For the 2017 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for seven reporting units. For each of these reporting units, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that for these seven reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For 2017, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for the CBS Sports Network reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, which is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For 2017, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method for CBS Sports Network resulted in similar estimated fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections and for 2017 was 2.0%. The discount rate was determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities and for 2017 was 8.5%.

For the 2017 annual impairment test the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $261 million, exceeded its carrying value by 4% and therefore no impairment charge was required. An increase to the discount rate of 25 basis points, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rate of 35 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit to fall below its carrying value.

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in its goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Reserves and Legal Matters

Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company’s pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2017, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased from the prior year-end due primarily to the Company’s purchase of a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company has permanently assumed the obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, which accelerated the recognition of unamortized actuarial losses. This reduction in unrecognized actuarial losses was partially offset by the impact from a decrease in the discount rate. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $104 million and would not have a material impact on 2018 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $7 million to 2018 pension expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $138 million at December 31, 2017 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

II-41

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

As a result of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act on December 22, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $407 million for the estimated tax impact on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits. This amount was based on the Company’s current estimate; however, the final impact of the Tax Reform Act may differ materially from this estimate since all of the necessary information was not available, prepared or analyzed in sufficient detail to complete the assessment of the Tax Reform Act. In addition, future interpretive guidance issued by federal and state tax authorities may impact this provisional amount. The Company will complete its analysis of this provisional amount and finalize and record any adjustments to its estimate within one year from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. 

Legal Matters 

General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, ‘‘litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had pending approximately 31,660 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 33,610 as of December 31, 2016 and 36,030 as of December 31, 2015. During 2017, the Company received approximately 3,530 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 5,480 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company’s total costs for the years 2017 and 2016 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $57 million and $48 million, respectively. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and 

II-42

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has remained generally flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $410 million and $433 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.

Interest Risk

The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016 but in the future may use derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rates.

II-43

Credit Risk

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2017 or 2016, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.
