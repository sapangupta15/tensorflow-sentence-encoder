Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data

For the fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 ("fiscal 2012"), we reported Net Earnings of $4.5 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $3.00 compared to Net Earnings of $3.9 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.47 for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 ("fiscal 2011"). The results for fiscal 2012 included a total charge of $145 million, net of tax, related to the closing of our remaining seven big box stores in China ("China store closings") in fiscal 2012, which had a negative impact of $0.10 to Diluted Earnings per Share. Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, Net Earnings were $4.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. 

Net Sales increased 6.2% to $74.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $70.4 billion for fiscal 2011. Our comparable store sales increased 4.6% in fiscal 2012, driven by a 2.9% increase in our comparable store average ticket and an increase in our comparable store customer transactions. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 4.9% in fiscal 2012.

Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks for fiscal 2011. The 53rd week added approximately $1.2 billion in Net Sales and increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012.

In fiscal 2012, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:

Customer Service – Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and simplifying the business. In fiscal 2012, we opened new customer call centers in Utah and Georgia to support our interconnected business. In addition, as a result of initiatives such as our new scheduling system for our associates and a centralized return to vendor process initiated in fiscal 2011, we now have approximately 57% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity and expect to achieve our goal of 60% in fiscal 2013. Through these and other efforts, we continue to see our customer satisfaction survey scores improve.

Product Authority – Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering product innovation, assortment and value. As part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for both our professional and D-I-Y customers in a variety of departments. Also in fiscal 2012, we expanded some of our appliance showrooms to include the Electrolux®, Whirlpool® and Frigidaire® brands. These brands were also added to our e-commerce platform in fiscal 2012.

Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency – Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement, incremental supply chain benefits, disciplined capital allocation and expense control and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2012, we completed the mechanization of all of our RDCs, which we expect to further improve the cost effectiveness of this platform. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.5 times at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2011. 

We repurchased a total of 74 million shares for $4.0 billion through ASR agreements and the open market during fiscal 2012. In addition, in February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization, and announced a 34% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share.

Interconnected Retail – Our focus on interconnected retail is based on building a competitive platform across all commerce channels. During fiscal 2012, we launched improvements to our website, including MyInstall, which is designed to improve transparency and communication in installation projects and to simplify the customer experience. We made several enhancements to our professional customer website, including adding an online bulk pricing program that mirrors our in-store bulk pricing program. We also introduced new programs, such as Buy Online, Return In Store ("BORIS") and Buy Online, Ship To Store ("BOSS") in fiscal 2012, to expand upon Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store ("BOPIS"), which we introduced in fiscal 2011.

In May 2012, we acquired MeasureComp L.L.C., a flooring measurement and quote building company. MeasureComp's business was largely dedicated to The Home Depot and by in-sourcing this service under Home Depot Measurement Services, we expect to build a seamless process for our flooring customers that is designed to provide a better experience for them and a better close rate for us.

In October 2012, we completed the acquisition of U.S. Home Systems, Inc. ("USHS"). USHS was an exclusive provider of kitchen and bath refacing products and services as well as closet and garage organizational systems to The Home Depot. This acquisition will allow us to create more effective interconnection between our stores and the USHS in-home selling platform under Home Depot Interiors, similar to what we have done with our roofing, siding and windows businesses.

 17
We also completed the acquisition of BlackLocus, Inc. in December 2012. BlackLocus is a data analytics and pricing company, which will bring additional tools and capabilities to support our merchandising team.

We opened twelve new stores, including nine new stores in Mexico, two new stores in the U.S. and one relocation in the U.S., and closed seven stores in China in fiscal 2012, for a total store count of 2,256 at the end of fiscal 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2012, a total of 280 of our stores, or 12.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico.

We generated $7.0 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012. We used this cash flow to fund $4.0 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.7 billion of dividends and fund $1.3 billion in capital expenditures.

Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 17.0% for fiscal 2012 compared to 14.9% for fiscal 2011. 

 18
We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.

Results of Operations

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 

Net Sales

Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011. Net Sales for fiscal 2012 increased 6.2% to $74.8 billion from $70.4 billion for fiscal 2011. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 4.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 3.4% for fiscal 2011.

The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments except for one posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012, and comparable store average ticket increased 2.9% for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Tools, Bath, Electrical, Lighting, Indoor Garden and Décor product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Hardware, Plumbing, Outdoor Garden, Kitchen and Millwork product categories were positive for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Building Materials product category were negative for fiscal 2012, reflecting the impact of weather and difficult year-over-year comparisons in roofing due to storm and repair activity that drove sales in fiscal 2011. 

Gross Profit

Gross Profit increased 6.5% to $25.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011. Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the China store closings. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.5% for fiscal 2011, an increase of 10 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by a change in mix of products sold and benefits from our supply chain transformation in the U.S.

Operating Expenses

Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased 3.0% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2012 from $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011. SG&A for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 22.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 22.8% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, SG&A as a percent of Net Sales was 21.9% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls, and lower credit card expense and casualty reserves, offset by the charge related to the China store closings.

Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 2.2% for fiscal 2011. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment.

Operating Income

Operating Income increased 16.6% to $7.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 10.4% for fiscal 2012 compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, Operating Income increased 18.8% to $7.9 billion for fiscal 2012.

Interest and Other, net

In fiscal 2012, we recognized $545 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $593 million for fiscal 2011. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.7% for fiscal 2012 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2011. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. ("HD Supply Guarantee"). 

Provision for Income Taxes

Our combined effective income tax rate was 37.2% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2011 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million of charges related to the China store closings. Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from 

 20
the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements. 

Diluted Earnings per Share 

Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.00 for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.47 for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charges related to the China store closings, Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. The 53rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2012 also reflect $0.11 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended February 3, 2013.

Non-GAAP Measures

To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect certain adjustments. The results for fiscal 2012 included a $145 million charge, net of tax, related to the China store closings as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no adjustments for fiscal 2011 or 2010 for events of unusual nature or frequency. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2012 (amounts in millions, except per share data): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Net Sales

Net Sales for fiscal 2011 increased 3.5% to $70.4 billion from $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 3.4% for fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2.9% for fiscal 2010.

The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives, economic growth and favorable weather conditions. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 13 of our 15 departments for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Building Materials, Paint, Hardware, Tools, Plumbing, Electrical, Kitchen and Décor product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Flooring, Bath, Lighting, Outdoor Garden and Indoor Garden product categories were positive for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales for our Lumber and Millwork product categories were negative for fiscal 2011. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.6% increase in our comparable store average ticket and an 0.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions.

Gross Profit

Gross Profit increased 4.1% to $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011 from $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 34.3% for fiscal 2010, an increase of 20 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the U.S., which was partially offset by higher shrink compared to fiscal 2010.

Operating Expenses

SG&A increased 1.1% to $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011 from $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 22.8% for fiscal 2011 compared to 23.3% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2011 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment partially offset by a $32 million impairment charge for a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business that was sold in fiscal 2011 and $26 

 21
million of expenses related to natural disasters. Additionally, we experienced an expense benefit of $44 million in fiscal 2010 related to our private label credit card that did not repeat in fiscal 2011.

Depreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 2.4% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets.

Operating Income

Operating Income increased 14.1% to $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011 from $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 9.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 8.6% for fiscal 2010.

Interest and Other, net

In fiscal 2011, we recognized $593 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $566 million for fiscal 2010. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010 reflects a $51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our HD Supply Guarantee. Additionally, we experienced a $44 million benefit in fiscal 2010 that arose from favorable Internal Revenue Service guidance and a resulting reversal of an interest accrual.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our combined effective income tax rate decreased to 36.0% for fiscal 2011 from 36.7% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements.

Diluted Earnings per Share

Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.47 for fiscal 2011 compared to $2.01 for fiscal 2010. Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2011 reflect $0.13 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended January 29, 2012.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2012, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $7.0 billion compared to $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011. This increase reflects a $652 million increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. In support of sales growth, we grew merchandise inventory. The increase in inventory, net of the corresponding increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offsets the increase in operating cash flows generated by Net Earnings by $330 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2012 was $1.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2011. This change was primarily due to a $105 million increase in Payments for Businesses Acquired, net, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, no Proceeds from Sale of Business, net, in fiscal 2012 compared to $101 million in fiscal 2011 related to the sale of a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business, and a $91 million increase in Capital Expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2012 was $5.0 billion compared to $4.0 billion for fiscal 2011. This change was primarily the result of how we funded our share repurchase program. In fiscal 2012, we repurchased $4.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock using cash flow generated from operations. In fiscal 2011, we repurchased $3.5 billion of our outstanding shares, and funded $1.0 billion of those repurchases with proceeds from long-term borrowings. We did not issue any long-term borrowings in fiscal 2012. The repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2012 were partially offset by $478 million more in proceeds from sales of common stock due to increased stock option exercises in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.

In fiscal 2012, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $3.05 billion of our common stock. Under the agreements, we paid $3.05 billion to the financial institutions, using cash on hand, and received a total of 58 million shares in fiscal 2012. Also in fiscal 2012, we repurchased 16 million additional shares of our common stock for $950 million through the open market. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002, we have repurchased 1.0 billion shares of our common stock for a total of $37.6 billion. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization.

 22
In March 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% Senior Notes due April 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the "March 2011 issuance"). Interest on these Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2011. The net proceeds of the March 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock, and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our 5.20% Senior Notes that matured March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.

In connection with the March 2011 issuance, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011.

In March 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016, with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At February 3, 2013, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $36 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement.

Also at February 3, 2013, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes due December 16, 2013 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At February 3, 2013, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $28 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements.

We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of February 3, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of February 3, 2013, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility.

We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

In connection with the sale of HD Supply on August 30, 2007, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012, the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, we reversed the $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012.

As of February 3, 2013, we had $2.5 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. 

In March 2013, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we will pay $1.5 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and receive an initial delivery of approximately 18 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 23
Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 3, 2013 (amounts in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 —————

(1)Excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts.

(2)Interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps.

(3)Includes $813 million of imputed interest.

(4)Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above.

(5)Excludes $533 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 3, 2013, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 82% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 18% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

As of February 3, 2013 we had, net of discounts, $10.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded Senior Notes as of February 3, 2013 was approximately $12.2 billion.

Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices

We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.

Revenues

We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated 

 24
Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales.

Merchandise Inventories

Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 76% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2012 or 2011.

Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Self-Insurance

We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including products liability), workers’ compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Vendor Allowances

Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. 

Volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SG&A.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.

The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SG&A the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income.

We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the China store closings in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. During fiscal 2012, for all reporting units other than our China reporting unit, we used qualitative factors to determine that our goodwill balances for each reporting unit were not impaired. For our China reporting unit, we recorded a charge of $97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit in fiscal 2012. Impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill were not material for fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.

We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to our other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income" ("ASU No. 2011-05"). ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. Under ASU No. 2011-05, an entity can elect to present items of net earnings and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, and retrospective application was required. This guidance impacted the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
