Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Introduction  

Morgan Stanley, an FHC, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segmentsInstitutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Morgan Stanley, Firm, us, we or our mean Morgan Stanley (the Parent Company) together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We define the following as part of our consolidated financial statements (financial statements): consolidated income statements (income statements), consolidated balance sheets (balance sheets), and consolidated cash flow statements (cash flow statements). See the Glossary of Common Acronyms for definitions of certain acronyms used throughout the 2017 Form 10-K.  

A description of the clients and principal products and services of each of our business segments is as follows:

2017 Compared with 2016  

     

We reported net revenues of $37,945 million in 2017 compared with $34,631 million in 2016. For 2017, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $6,111 million, or $3.07 per diluted common share, compared with $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, in 2016.  

     

Results for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, or $0.53 per diluted common share, primarily related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), partially offset by net discrete tax benefits related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations. Results for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.

 Tax Act and the net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

     

Excluding the intermittent net discrete tax items, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $7,079 million, or $3.60 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared with $5,911 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, in 2016 (see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein).  

Non-interest Expenses  

($ in millions)  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses of $17,166 million in 2017 increased 8% from $15,878 million in 2016. The 2017 results primarily reflected increases in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives linked to higher revenues, the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, incentive compensation mainly driven by higher revenues and deferred compensation associated with carried interest in the Investment Management business segment.  

     

Non-compensation expenses were $10,376 million in 2017 compared with $9,905 million in 2016, representing a 5% increase. This increase was primarily a result of higher volume-related expenses and litigation costs.  

2016 Compared with 2015  

     

We reported net revenues of $34,631 million in 2016, compared with $35,155 million in 2015. For 2016, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, compared with $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2015. 

     

Results for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Results for 2015 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated and positive revenues due to the impact of DVA of $618 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. For a further discussion of the net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

     

Effective January 1, 2016, we early adopted a provision of the accounting update Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities that requires unrealized gains and losses from debt-related credit spreads and other credit factors (i.e., DVA) to be presented in OCI as opposed to Trading revenues. Results for 2015 are not restated pursuant to that guidance.  

     

Net revenues were $34,631 million in 2016 compared with net revenues of $34,537 million excluding DVA in 2015. Excluding the intermittent net discrete tax benefits, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,911 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, in 2016 compared with $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, excluding both DVA and the intermittent net discrete tax benefits in 2015 (see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein).  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses of $15,878 million in 2016 decreased 1% from $16,016 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Non-compensation expenses were $9,905 million in 2016 compared with $10,644 million in 2015, representing a 7% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs and expense management.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

2017 Compared with 2016  

     

Institutional Securities net revenues of $18,813 million in 2017 increased 8% from 2016, primarily reflecting higher revenues from Investment banking.  

     

Wealth Management net revenues of $16,836 million in 2017 increased 10% from 2016, primarily reflecting growth in Asset management revenues and Net interest income.  

     

Investment Management net revenues of $2,586 million in 2017 increased 22% from 2016, primarily reflecting higher revenues from Investments and Asset management.  

2016 Compared with 2015  

     

Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,459 million in 2016 decreased 3% compared with $17,953 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily a result of lower Investment banking and sales and trading revenues, which included DVA gains in 2015, partially offset by higher Other revenues.  

     

Wealth Management net revenues of $15,350 million in 2016 increased 2% from $15,100 million in 2015, primarily as a result of growth in Net interest income, partially offset by lower Commissions and fees and Investment banking revenues.  

     

Investment Management net revenues of $2,112 million in 2016 decreased 9% from $2,315 million in 2015, primarily reflecting weaker investment performance compared with 2015. This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not re-occur in 2016. Asset management fees in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015.

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information  

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, Definitive Proxy Statement and otherwise. A non-GAAP financial measure excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors and analysts by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, our financial condition, operating results, prospective regulatory capital requirements or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure.  

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Business Segment  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Adjustments to the related U.S. GAAP figures are made to exclude intermittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits) for all periods presented. Beginning in 2017, income tax consequences associated with employee share-based awards are recognized in Provision for income taxes in the income statements but are excluded from the intermittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits) adjustment as we anticipate conversion activity each year. See Note 2 to the financial statements for information on the adoption of the accounting update Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. For 2015, results are also adjusted to exclude DVA, whereas in 2017 and 2016 unrealized DVA gains (losses) were recorded within OCI in the comprehensive income statements in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The effect of DVA on Net revenues and Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley in 2015 was $618 million and $399 million, respectively. The effect of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity for 2015 was $637 million. See Note 15 to the financial statements for further information on DVA. See Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein for further information on the net discrete tax provisions (benefits).  

 2.  

The calculations used in determining the Firms ROE and ROTCE Targets are the Adjusted ROE and Adjusted ROTCE amounts shown in the previous table. ROE and ROTCE equal net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, on a consolidated basis as indicated. When excluding intermittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits) for all periods presented and DVA for 2015, both the numerator and denominator are adjusted.  

 3.  

The expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues. For 2015, the expense efficiency ratio is adjusted to exclude DVA.  

 4.  

Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.  

 5.  

Pre-tax profit margin represents income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.  

 6.  

Average common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory RequirementsAttribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework herein). 

 7.  

The calculation of ROE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity allocated to each segment. Adjusted ROE excludes intermittent net discrete tax items by business segment for all periods presented. Adjusted ROE for 2015 also excludes DVA. Adjusted ROE for 2017: IS 8.9%, WM 15.3%, IM 13.6%; for 2016: IS 7.4%, WM 13.4%, IM 7.6%; and for 2015: IS 7.1%, WM 16.9%, IM 15.8%.  

Return on Equity and Tangible Common Equity Targets  

We previously established an ROE Target of 9% to 11% to be achieved by 2017. Excluding the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, primarily related to the Tax Act, we generated a 9.4% ROE for 2017.  

In January 2018, we established an ROE Target of 10% to 13% for the medium term. This is equivalent to an ROTCE Target range of 11.5% to 14.5%.  

Our ROE and ROTCE Targets are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; outsize legal expenses or penalties and the ability to maintain a reduced level of expenses; capital levels; and intermittent discrete tax items. Given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that our ROE and ROTCE Targets may not be realized. Actual results may differ from our objectives and the differences may be material and adverse. Accordingly, we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for additional information regarding these forward-looking statements.  

For non-GAAP measures (ROE and ROTCE), see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein. For information on the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, including the Tax Act, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

Business Segments  

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.  

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Net Revenues  

Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.  

Trading. Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which we act as a market maker, as well as gains and losses on our related positions and other positions carried at fair value. Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other positions carried at fair value. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.  

As a market maker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:  

 (i)  

taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell anddepending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the positionto hold those positions for a period of time;  

 (ii)  

building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory through trades with other market participants;  

 (iii)  

managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;  

 (iv)  

trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and  

 (v)  

engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.  

Interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held by us earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreements to repurchase and purchased with agreements to resell. 

We invest in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in either Trading revenues or Investments revenues. Expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in Compensation and benefits. See Compensation Expense herein for more details.  

Investments. Our investments generally are held for long-term appreciation or, as discussed above, for hedging purposes, and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. In some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products.  

The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.  

Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The sales restrictions on the investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in certain Investment Management funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see Note 3 to the financial statements). Restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time where we are clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.  

Commissions and Fees. Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded in Commissions and fees. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for any related services are recorded in Commissions and fees.  

Asset Management. Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Net Interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities (which include AFS securities and HTM securities), Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits, and Borrowings. In addition, Net interest is a function of trading strategies, customer activity in the prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.  

Other. Other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, realized gains and losses on AFS securities, gains and losses on loan commitments and loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Net Revenues by Segment  

Institutional Securities  

Net revenues are composed of Investment banking revenues, sales and trading net revenues, Investments and Other revenues.  

For information about the composition of Investment banking revenues, see Net Revenues herein.  

Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues, and Net interest. In assessing the profitability of our sales and trading activities, we view these net revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to trading are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.  

Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equities and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items.  

EquitiesFinancing. We provide financing and prime brokerage services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities and equity lending products and in Trading revenues for derivative products.  

EquitiesExecution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major 

 stock and derivative exchanges as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including providing liquidity and hedging products. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory, which are reflected in Trading revenues.  

Fixed incomeWithin fixed income we make markets in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services:  

     

Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand, and are recorded in Trading revenues.  

     

Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial and residential mortgage lending, asset-backed lending, and financing extended to municipalities. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.  

     

Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil, and precious metals, with the results primarily reflected in Trading revenues. Other activities include the results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures, which are primarily recorded in Trading revenues.  

Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain central treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains (losses) on economic hedges related to certain borrowings, as well as certain activities associated with corporate lending.  

For information about revenue from Investments, see Net Revenues herein.  

Other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, gains and losses on loans held for sale and loan commitments, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Wealth Management  

Net revenues are composed of Transactional, Asset management, Net interest and Other revenues. 

 December 2017 Form 10-K   40     

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees. Investment banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which we act as principal, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Revenues from Commissions and fees primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.  

Asset management revenues include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees from Investment Management. Mutual fund distribution fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of AUM.  

Net interest income includes interest related to bank deposits, interest on AFS securities and HTM securities, interest on lending activities and other net interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. Net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions, bank deposit activity, time deposits and savings deposits.  

Other revenues include revenues from realized gains and losses on AFS securities, provision for loan losses, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Investment Management  

Net revenues are composed of Investments and Asset management revenues.  

Investments revenue is primarily earned on investments in certain closed-end funds that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject to sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. Investments revenue also contains performance fees from fund management activities in the form of carried interest that are subject to reversal.  

Asset management revenues include revenues from investment management services we provide to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. We receive 

 fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.  

Compensation Expense  

Compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, carried interest, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits.  

The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm, business unit and individual performance. Compensation for our remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (i.e., base salary and benefits).  

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.  

Income Taxes  

The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Source: Thomson Reuters, data at January 2, 2018. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or change in the value of a transaction.  

 1.  

Amounts include transactions of $100 million or more. Completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction.  

 2.  

Equity and equity-related offerings and fixed income offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers.  

 3.  

Amounts include Rule 144A issuances and registered public offerings of common stock and convertible securities and rights offerings.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2017 Compared with 2016  

Investment banking revenues of $5,537 million in 2017 increased 24% from 2016 due to higher underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower advisory revenues.  

     

Advisory revenues decreased reflecting the lower volumes of completed M&A (see Investment Banking Volumes table), partially offset by the positive impact of higher fee realizations.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2016 Compared with 2015  

Investment banking revenues of $4,476 million in 2016 decreased 11% from 2015 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by an increase in advisory revenues in 2016.  

     

Advisory revenues increased reflecting the higher dollar volume of completed M&A activity (see Investment Banking Volumes table). As the number of completed transactions decreased in 2016 versus 2015, the 2016 revenue increase was at a lower rate than the percentage increase in dollar volume.  

     

Equity underwriting revenues decreased as a result of lower equity-related offerings in 2016 (see Investment Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower bond and loan fees.

As discussed in Net Revenues by Segment herein, we manage each of the sales and trading businesses based on its aggregate net revenues, which are comprised of the income statement line items quantified in the previous table. Trading revenues are affected by a variety of market dynamics, including volumes, bid-offer spreads and inventory prices, as well as impacts from hedging activity, which are interrelated. We provide qualitative commentary in the discussion of results that follow on the key drivers of period-over-period variances, as the quantitative impact of the various market dynamics typically cannot be disaggregated.  

For additional information on total Trading revenues, see the table Trading Revenues by Product Type in Note 4 to the financial statements.  

2017 Compared with 2016  

Equity  

Equity sales and trading net revenues of $7,982 million in 2017 decreased 1% from 2016, reflecting lower results in execution services.  

     

Financing revenues remained relatively unchanged from 2016. The results reflected higher client activity in equity swaps reflected in Trading revenues, offset by a decline in Net interest revenues from higher net interest costs, reflecting the business increased portion of GLR requirements and a shift in the mix of financing transactions.

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Execution services decreased from 2016, primarily reflecting lower results in derivatives products mainly driven by lower corporate activity and volatility, partially offset by higher gains on cash equity products recorded in Trading revenues.  

Fixed Income  

Fixed income net revenues of $4,928 million in 2017 were 4% lower than in 2016, driven by lower results in global macro products, partially offset by higher results in credit products, and commodities products and other.  

     

Global macro products decreased primarily due to the lack of a constructive market environment, inventory positioning, and lower client activity reflected in both Trading and Net interest.  

     

Credit products increased primarily due to the absence of losses driven by a widening spread environment in 2016 and increased securitization activity reflected in Trading revenues, partially offset by reduced Net interest revenues. Net interest revenues decreased as a result of a lower level of interest realized in securitized products and lower net interest spreads, partially offset by increased lending activity.  

     

Commodities products and Other increased primarily due to higher revenues in other lending and OTC client clearing.  

Other  

     

Other sales and trading net losses of $632 million in 2017 decreased from 2016, primarily reflecting lower losses associated with corporate loan hedging activity and increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, partially offset by higher funding costs.  

2016 Compared with 2015  

Equity  

Excluding the $163 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,037 million in 2016 were lower than in 2015.  

     

Financing revenues were in line with the results from 2015 as Net interest revenues declined from higher net interest costs, reflecting the business increased portion of GLR requirements, offset by increased client activity in equity swaps reflected in Trading. 

     

Execution services decreased 2% from 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in fee revenues of $196 million due to reduced client activity.  

Fixed Income  

Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, fixed income net revenues of $5,117 million in 2016 were 19% higher than in 2015, primarily due to improved results in credit products.  

     

Credit products Trading revenues were the primary driver for the overall increase in fixed income Trading revenues of $782 million, reflecting an improved credit market environment that resulted in gains on inventory in 2016 compared with losses in 2015.  

     

Overall results from other fixed income businesses were relatively unchanged. There was a net increase in Trading revenues from global macro products, reflecting gains on inventory in interest rate products, offset by declines in commodities activities, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015. For more information on the sale of the global oil merchanting business, see Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Noncontrolling Interests2016 Compared with 2015Dispositions herein.

Other  

     

Other revenues of $630 million in 2017 increased from 2016, primarily reflecting a decrease in the provision on loans held for investment and higher results from other investments, partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains on loans held for sale.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Non-interest Expenses  

Non-interest expenses of $13,169 million in 2017 increased from 2016, primarily reflecting a 6% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and an 8% increase in Non-compensation expenses in 2017.  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2017, primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, and incentive compensation driven mainly by higher revenues.  

     

Non-compensation expenses increased in 2017, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and litigation costs related to legacy RMBS matters.  

2016 Compared with 2015  

Investments  

     

Net investment gains of $147 million in 2016 decreased from 2015 as a result of lower gains on real estate and business-related investments and losses on investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced in 2016 compared with gains in 2015.  

Other  

     

Other revenues of $535 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting mark-to-market gains on loans held for sale in 2016 compared with mark-to-market losses in 2015, partially offset by lower results related to our 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (MUMSS) (see Note 8 to the financial statements for further information).  

Non-interest Expenses  

Non-interest expenses of $12,336 million in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily reflecting a 3% reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses and an 11% reduction in Non-compensation expenses in 2016.  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced. 

     

Non-compensation expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower litigation costs and Professional services expense. In 2015, Non-compensation expenses included increases to reserves for the settlement of a CDS antitrust litigation matter and legacy RMBS.  

Income Tax Items  

In 2017, we recognized in Provision for income taxes an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $471 million. This net discrete tax provision included an approximate $705 million impact from the Tax Act, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations. For a further discussion of the Tax Act and other discrete items, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein and Note 21 to the financial statements.  

In 2016, we recognized in Provision for income taxes intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $83 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.  

In 2015, we recognized in Provision for income taxes intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization in the U.K.  

Dispositions  

On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton Commodities International LLC. The loss on sale of approximately $71 million was recognized in Other revenues.  

Noncontrolling Interests  

Noncontrolling interests primarily relate to MUFGs interest in Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. Ltd. (MSMS).

Income Statement Information  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Effective July 1, 2016, the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments entered into an agreement, whereby Institutional Securities assumed management of Wealth Managements fixed income client-driven trading activities and employees. Institutional Securities now pays fees to Wealth Management based on distribution activity (collectively, the Fixed Income Integration). Results prior to the Fixed Income Integration have not been recast for this new intersegment agreement due to immateriality.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Investment banking revenues increased in 2017, primarily due to higher revenues from structured products and equity syndicate activities, partially offset by lower preferred stock syndicate activity.  

     

Trading revenues decreased in 2017, primarily due to lower revenues related to the Fixed Income Integration and lower client activity in fixed income products, partially offset by gains on investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Commissions and fees were relatively unchanged in 2017 compared with 2016.  

Asset Management  

Asset management revenues of $9,342 million in 2017 increased 11% compared with 2016, primarily due to market appreciation and net positive flows. These increases were partially offset by decreases in average fee rates across all account types.  

See Fee-Based Client Assets herein for more details.  

Net Interest  

Net interest of $4,105 million in 2017 increased 16% compared with 2016, primarily due to higher loan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits.  

Other  

Other revenues of $268 million in 2017 decreased 3% compared with 2016, primarily due to lower realized gains from the AFS securities portfolio.  

Non-interest Expenses  

Non-interest expenses of $12,537 million in 2017 increased 5% compared with 2016 due to higher Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in Non-compensation expenses.  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2017, primarily due to the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives linked to higher revenues, and due to increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Non-compensation expenses decreased in 2017, primarily due to the absence of a $70 million provision recorded in 2016 related to certain brokerage service reporting activities (see prior year explanation for Non-interest Expenses herein) and lower litigation and information processing costs, partially offset by higher consulting fees related to strategic initiatives and higher FDIC insurance expenses. 

2016 Compared with 2015  

Net Revenues  

Transactional Revenues  

Transactional revenues of $3,090 million in 2016 decreased 7% compared with 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues related to commissions and fees and investment banking revenues, partially offset by higher trading revenues.  

     

Investment banking revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of unit investment trusts, and equity and structured products.  

     

Trading revenues increased in 2016, primarily due to gains on investments to which certain employee deferred compensation plans are referenced compared with losses in 2015.  

     

Commissions and fees decreased in 2016, reflecting lower daily average commissions, primarily due to reduced client activity in equity, annuity and mutual fund products. This decrease was partially offset by increased fees due to the Fixed Income Integration.  

Asset Management  

Asset management revenues of $8,454 million in 2016 decreased 1% compared with 2015, primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund fees. Revenues from fee-based accounts were relatively flat with decreased client fee rates, partially offset by positive flows.  

See Fee-Based Client Assets herein for more details.  

Net Interest  

Net interest of $3,529 million in 2016 increased 19% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher loan balances and investment portfolio yields.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Non-compensation expenses increased in 2016, primarily as a result of a $70 million provision related to identified operational issues that resulted in the reporting of incorrect cost basis tax information to the IRS and retail brokerage clients for tax years 2011 through 2016.  

Income Tax Items  

In 2017, we recognized in Provision for income taxes an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $411 million, which included approximately $402 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. For a discussion of the Tax Act, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein. For the impact of other discrete tax items, see Note 21 to the financial statements.  

Fee-Based Client Assets  

Wealth Management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of fee-based client assets related to certain account types that we offer. These fees, which we record in the Asset management line on our income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the client participates and are generally not driven by asset class. For most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the end of the prior quarter. Across the account types, fees will vary based on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in Wealth Management.

Effective Tax Rate from Continuing Operations  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2017  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, primarily related to the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations.  

The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; imposes a minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and an alternative base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) on U.S. corporations that make deductible payments to non-U.S. related persons in excess of specified amounts; and broadens the tax base by partially or wholly eliminating tax deductions for certain historically deductible expenses (e.g., FDIC premiums and executive compensation).  

We recorded an approximate $1.2 billion net discrete tax provision as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, primarily from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets using the lower enacted corporate tax rate. This provision incorporates the best available information as of the enactment date as well as assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the Tax Act. Our estimates may change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department and as the  

interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time. The ultimate 

 impact of the income tax effects of the Tax Act will be determined in connection with the preparation of our U.S. consolidated federal income tax return.  

Taking into account our current assumptions, estimates and interpretations related to the Tax Act and other factors, we expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2018 to be approximately 22% to 25%, depending on factors such as the geographic mix of earnings and employee share-based awards (see Forward-Looking Statements).  

Subsequent to the release of the Firms 2017 earnings on January 18, 2018, certain estimates related to the net discrete tax provision associated with the enactment of the Tax Act were revised, resulting in a $43 million increase in the Provision for income taxes and a reallocation of impacts among segments. This decreased diluted EPS and diluted EPS from continuing operations by $0.03 and $0.02 in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. On a business segment basis, the change resulted in an $89 million increase in Provision for income taxes for Wealth Management, a $45 million decrease for Institutional Securities, and a $1 million decrease for Investment Management.  

2016  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.  

2015  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the legal entity organization in the U.K.  

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  

We provide loans to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals, primarily through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (MSBNA) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (MSPBNA) (collectively, U.S. Bank Subsidiaries). The lending activities in the Institutional Securities business segment primarily include loans and lending commitments to corporate clients. The lending activities in the Wealth Management business segment primarily include securities-based lending that allows clients to borrow

Accounting Development Updates  

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  

The following accounting update was adopted on January 1, 2018.  

     

Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This accounting update aims to clarify the principles of revenue recognition, develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for U.S. GAAP and provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize 

 revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update is not applicable to financial instruments.  

We applied the modified retrospective method of adoption which resulted in an immaterial impact to Retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.  

This accounting update will change the presentation of certain costs related to underwriting and advisory activities so that such costs will be recorded in the relevant non-compensation expense line item versus the current practice of netting such costs against Investment banking revenues. This change is estimated to gross up Investment banking revenues and non-compensation expenses for the Institutional Securities business segment by approximately 5%. Similarly, certain costs related to the selling and distribution of investment funds will no longer be netted against Asset management revenues, and therefore is expected to result in a gross-up of such revenues by less than 5% and non-compensation expenses by less than 10% for the Investment Management business segment. These changes will not have an impact on net income.  

In addition, the timing of the recognition of certain performance fees from fund management activities, not in the form of carried interest, is generally expected to be deferred within a fiscal year until the fees are no longer probable of being reversed. Thus, the recognition of a greater portion of such revenues are expected to be recognized in the second half of each fiscal year based on current fee arrangements. These revenues are recorded in Asset management revenues within the Investment Management business segment, which approximated $80 million in 2017 and were recognized throughout the year.  

The recognition of performance fees from fund management activities in the form of carried interest that are subject to reversal will remain essentially unchanged. We will apply the equity method of accounting to such carried interest, thus excluding them from the scope of this standard.  

The following accounting updates are currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:  

     

Hedge Accounting. This accounting update aims to better align the hedge accounting requirements with an entitys risk management strategies and improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships. It will also result in simplification of the application of hedge accounting related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. 

    53   December 2017 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Currently, we plan to early adopt this accounting update in the first quarter of 2018 and estimate that the resulting transition adjustment to 2018 opening retained earnings would not be significant. This adjustment would represent the cumulative effect of applying the new rules from the inception of certain fair value hedges of the interest rate risk of our borrowings, in particular the provision allowing only the benchmark rate component of coupon cash flows to be hedged.  

     

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This accounting update allows companies the option to reclassify from AOCI to retained earnings the stranded tax effects that resulted from the remeasurement of and other adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities upon enactment of the Tax Act. The total impact of the remeasurement and other adjustments was reflected in 2017 income from continuing operations, regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. For a discussion of the Tax Act, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

     

Leases. This accounting update requires lessees to recognize in the balance sheet all leases with terms exceeding one year, which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. The right of use asset and lease liability will initially be measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.  

     

Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses. This accounting update impacts the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. CECL will replace the loss model currently applicable to loans held for investment, HTM securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost.  

The update also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for AFS securities. Impairments on AFS securities will be required to be recognized in earnings through an allowance, when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists or the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.  

Under the update, there may be an ability to determine there are no expected credit losses in certain circumstances, e.g., based on collateral arrangements for lending and financing transactions or based on the credit quality of the borrower or issuer. 

Overall, the amendments in this update are expected to accelerate the recognition of credit losses for portfolios where CECL models will be applied. This update is effective as of January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  

Fair Value  

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value  

A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:  

     

Trading assets and Trading liabilities;  

     

Investment SecuritiesAFS securities;  

     

Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;  

     

Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;  

     

Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;  

     

Certain Other secured financings; and  

     

Certain Borrowings, primarily structured notes.  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. 

 December 2017 Form 10-K   54     

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the valuation process, fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements.  

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements.  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis  

At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, certain of our assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs, intangible assets, other assets and other liabilities, and accrued expenses. We incur losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.  

See Note 3 to the financial statements for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  

Fair Value Control Processes  

We employ control processes designed to validate the fair value of our financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to ensure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding our valuation policies, processes and procedures.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill  

Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill.  

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist.  

For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (a) perform a quantitative impairment test or (b) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.  

When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the lesser of the excess of the carrying value over the fair value or the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  

The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.  

Intangible Assets  

Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount 

    55   December 2017 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.  

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.  

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies  

In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.  

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.  

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.  

For certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. 

Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.  

Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.  

See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions.  

Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting for unrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.  

Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Our deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.  

Our deferred tax balances also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not 

 December 2017 Form 10-K   56     

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire.  

Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount of these balances (net of valuation allowance) that we estimate it is more likely than not to realize at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes could reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.  

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.  

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Senior management, with oversight by the Asset and Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (Board), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee (FRC), Asset and Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board (BRC).  

Balance Sheet  

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

 activity increased across both the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities loan portfolios. These increases were partially offset by reductions in securities purchased under agreements to resell and other types of investments in the GLR. For further information regarding our GLR, see Global Liquidity Reserve herein.  

Securities Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending  

Securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements).  

Collateralized Financing Transactions

Included in Trading assets in the balance sheets.  

Customer Securities Financing  

The customer receivable portion of securities financing transactions primarily includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to our prime brokerage customers. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.  

Liquidity Risk Management Framework  

The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies. 

The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:  

     

Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;  

     

Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;  

     

Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and  

     

Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.  

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the GLR, which support our target liquidity profile.  

Required Liquidity Framework  

Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.  

Liquidity Stress Tests  

We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework.  

The scenarios or assumptions used by us in our Liquidity Stress Tests include, but are not limited to, the following:  

     

No government support;  

     

No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;  

     

Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;  

     

Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding; 

 December 2017 Form 10-K   58     

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;  

     

Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;  

     

Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;  

     

Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and  

     

Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions.  

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.  

At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.  

Global Liquidity Reserve  

We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the GLR is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. In addition, our GLR includes a discretionary surplus based on risk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and Firm-specific events. The GLR is held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries.

Regulatory Liquidity Framework  

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to the LCR requirements including a requirement to calculate each entitys LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

HQLA by Type of Asset and LCR  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries; U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities; sovereign bonds; investment grade corporate bonds; and publicly traded common equities.  

The regulatory definition of HQLA is substantially the same as our GLR. GLR includes cash placed at institutions other than central banks that is considered an inflow for LCR purposes. HQLA includes a portion of cash placed at central banks, certain unencumbered investment grade corporate bonds and publicly traded common equities, which do not meet the definition of our GLR.  

Net Stable Funding Ratio  

The objective of the NSFR is to reduce funding risk over a one-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.  

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) finalized the NSFR framework in 2014. In May 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would require a covered company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is measured with reference to sources of funding, including deposit and debt liabilities, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is measured by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items.  

If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures. Our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary to meet the requirement, which we would expect to accomplish by the effective date of any final rule. Our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ materially from estimates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see Risk Factors. 

Funding Management  

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.  

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include our equity capital, borrowings, Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.  

Secured Financing  

A substantial portion of our total assets consist of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. The liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded.  

We utilize shorter-term secured financing only for highly liquid assets and have established longer tenor limits for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the weighted average maturity of our secured financing of less liquid assets was greater than 120 days.  

To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our GLR against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.

We also maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which provide a valuable future source of liquidity. With the implementation of liquidity standards, we have also incorporated HQLA classifications that are consistent with the LCR definitions into our encumbrance reporting, which further substantiates the demonstrated liquidity characteristics of the unencumbered asset pool and our ability to readily identify new funding sources for such assets.  

Unsecured Financing  

We view borrowings and deposits as stable sources of funding. Unencumbered securities and non-security assets are financed with a combination of borrowings and deposits. Our unsecured financings include structured borrowings, whose payments and redemption values are based on the performance of certain underlying assets, including equity, credit, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities. When appropriate, we may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interest rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the financial statements).  

Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Represents balances swept from client brokerage accounts.  

 2.  

Certain time deposit accounts are carried at fair value under the accounting fair value option (see Note 3 to the financial statements).  

Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. Total deposits at December 31, 2017 were up slightly compared with December 31, 2016, primarily driven by proactive measures to increase Time deposits and Savings and other deposits, partially offset by a reduction in Brokerage sweep deposits due to client deployment of cash into the markets. 

Borrowings  

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business.  

Borrowings increased to $192,582 million as of December 31, 2017 compared with $165,716 million at December 31, 2016. This increase is a result of issuances, partially offset by maturities and retirements as presented in the following table.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 11 to the financial statements.  

Credit Ratings  

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider company-specific factors, other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes, and the macroeconomic environment, among other things.  

Our credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of U.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from non-governmental third-party sources of potential support.

In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position.  

The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and S&P Global Ratings. The following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios, from the lowest of Moodys ratings or S&P Global Ratings, based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.  

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments upon Potential Future Rating Downgrade  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among others, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, 

 individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.  

Capital Management  

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses. We attempt to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of our operating subsidiaries required equity.  

Common Stock

Our Board has authorized the repurchase of the Firms outstanding stock under a share repurchase program (Share Repurchase Program). Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, we consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases under our program will be exercised from time to time at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our capital position and market conditions. The share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. Share repurchases by us are subject to regulatory approval (see Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities).

Regulatory Requirements  

Regulatory Capital Framework  

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  

In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its agreement on a comprehensive set of revisions to its Basel III Framework. The revised requirements are expected to take effect starting January 2022, subject to U.S. banking agencies issuing implementation proposals. The impact on us of any revisions to the Basel Committees capital standards is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. banking agencies.  

Regulatory Capital Requirements  

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, RWAs and transition provisions follows.  

Regulatory Capital. Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in AOCI and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. Certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.  

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, we will be subject to the following buffers:  

     

A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;  

     

The Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and 

     

Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies at zero.  

The phase-in amount for each of the buffers was 50% of the fully phased-in buffer requirement in 2017, and increases to 75% in 2018. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see G-SIB Capital Surcharge herein.  

See Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements herein for additional capital requirements effective January 1, 2019.  

Risk-Weighted Assets. RWAs reflect both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:  

     

Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;  

     

Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and  

     

Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).  

For a further discussion of our market, credit and operational risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Our risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWAs (Standardized Approach) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (Advanced Approach). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWAs using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2017, our ratios are based on the Standardized Approach transitional rules. At December 31, 2016, the ratios were based on the Advanced Approach transitional rules.  

The minimum risk-based capital ratios applicable to us will change through January 1, 2019 as presented in the following chart.

These ratios assume the requirements for the G-SIB capital surcharge (3.0%) and CCyB (zero) remain at current levels. See Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements herein for additional capital requirements effective January 1, 2019.

Adjusted average assets represent the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and are composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets under U.S. GAAP during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 adjusted for disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.  

 2.  

The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement is 4.0%.  

The fully phased-in pro forma estimates in the previous tables are based on our current understanding of the capital rules and other factors, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from the Federal Reserve and as the interpretation of the regulations evolves over time. These fully phased-in pro forma estimates are non-GAAP financial measures because they were not yet effective at December 31, 2017. These preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially and should not be taken as a projection of what our capital, capital ratios, RWAs, earnings or other results will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see Risk Factors.  

Well-Capitalized Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios for U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For us to remain an FHC, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must qualify as well-capitalized by maintaining the minimum ratio requirements set forth in the previous table. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for FHCs to reflect the higher capital standards required of us under the capital rules. Assuming that the Federal Reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to FHCs, each of our risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio at December 31, 2017 would have exceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require an FHC to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and the FHCs particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

Amount reflects assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures and unsettled transactions, as applicable.  

Credit risk RWA increased $15,409 million in 2017 under the Standardized Approach, primarily driven by increased exposures in derivatives and margin lending. Credit risk RWA under the Advanced Approach decreased $6,589 million in 2017, primarily due to reduced exposures in corporate loans.  

Market risk RWA increased $13,978 million and $14,035 million in 2017 under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, respectively, primarily driven by increases in stressed VaR, specific risk charges from securitizations and non-securitizations, and incremental risk charges from broad-based increases in trading exposures in response to client demand.  

The decrease of $15,375 million in operational risk RWAs in 2017 under the Advanced Approach reflects a reduction in the internal loss frequency related to litigation utilized in the operational risk capital model.

Adjustments are to: (i) incorporate derivative exposures, including adding the related potential future exposure (including for derivatives cleared for clients), grossing up cash collateral netting where qualifying criteria are not met and adding the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) reflect the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; (iii) add the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures; and (iv) apply other adjustments to Tier 1 capital, including disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.  

The SLR becomes effective as a capital standard on January 1, 2018. Beginning on that date, we will be required to maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage ratio of 3% as well as an SLR capital buffer of at least 2% (for a total of at least 5%) in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In addition, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must maintain an SLR of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.  

U.S. Subsidiary Banks Pro Forma Supplementary Leverage Ratios on a Transitional Basis

The pro forma transitional and fully phased-in supplementary leverage exposures and ratios for both us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are non-GAAP financial measures because they were not yet effective at December 31, 2017. Our estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from estimates based on these regulations. Further, these expectations should not be taken as projections of what our SLR, earnings, assets or exposures will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see Risk Factors.  

G-SIB Capital Surcharge  

We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital 

 December 2017 Form 10-K   66     

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIBs size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (Method 1). The second method uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (Method 2) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. Our current G-SIB surcharge is 3%. The surcharge is being phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. The phase-in amount was 50% of the applicable surcharge in 2017, and increases to 75% in 2018 (see Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios: Transitional Provisions herein).  

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements  

On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (covered BHC), including the Parent Company, that establishes external TLAC, long-term debt (LTD) and clean holding company requirements. The final rule contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured, have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance and not have certain derivative-linked features, typically associated with certain types of structured notes. We expect to be in compliance with all requirements of the rule by January 1, 2019, the date that compliance is required.  

The main purpose of the Federal Reserves minimum external TLAC and LTD requirements is to ensure that covered BHCs, including the Parent Company, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning and Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk).  

Under the final rule, a covered BHC is required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of 18% of total RWAs and 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of 6% of total RWAs plus the greater of the Method 1 and Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company and 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.  

In addition, the final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-based 

 external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHCs Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWAs. The leverage-exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHCs total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the TLAC buffers would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  

The final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.  

Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external short-term debt or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHCs outstanding external TLAC amount.  

Capital Plans and Stress Tests  

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual CCAR framework.  

We must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.  

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the requirements that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.  

The capital plan rule requires that large BHCs receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, 

    67   December 2017 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 the BHC must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the BHC would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A BHCs ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.  

In January 2017, the Federal Reserve adopted revisions to the capital plan and stress test rules that, among other things, reduce the de minimis threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserves prior approval. The final rule also establishes a blackout period beginning in March of each year while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR reviews, during which firms are not permitted to submit de minimis exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions. The Federal Reserve is currently considering making further changes to CCAR requirements.  

We submitted our 2017 Capital Plan (Capital Plan) and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2017. On June 22, 2017, the Federal Reserve published summary results of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us. On June 28, 2017, the Federal Reserve published summary results of CCAR and announced that it did not object to the Capital Plan.  

The Capital Plan includes the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of outstanding common stock for the period beginning July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, an increase from $3.5 billion in the 2016 Capital Plan. Additionally, the Capital Plan includes an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.25 per share from $0.20 per share, beginning with the common stock dividend declared on July 19, 2017. We disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on June 23, 2017 on our Investor Relations website. In addition, we submitted the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve on October 5, 2017 and disclosed a summary of the results on October 20, 2017 on our Investor Relations website.  

For the 2018 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2018. We expect that the Federal Reserve will provide its response to our 2018 capital plan by June 30, 2018. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us, by June 30, 2018. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results 

 of the supervisory stress tests. In addition, we must submit the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve by October 5, 2018 and disclose a summary of the results between October 5, 2018 and November 4, 2018.  

In addition, we must conduct semiannual company-run stress tests and are subject to an annual Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.  

The Dodd-Frank Act requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. MSBNA and MSPBNA submitted their 2017 annual company-run stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2017 and published a summary of their stress test results on June 23, 2017 on our Investor Relations website. For the 2018 stress test cycle, MSBNA and MSPBNA must submit their annual company-run stress tests to the OCC by April 5, 2018 and publish the summary results between June 15, 2018 and July 15, 2018.  

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework  

Our required capital (Required Capital) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segments relative contribution to our total Required Capital.  

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company equity. We generally hold Parent Company equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.  

Effective January 1, 2016, the common equity estimation and attribution to the business segments are based on our pro forma fully phased-in regulatory capital estimates. Prior periods were attributed based on transitional regulatory capital provisions and have not been recast. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). Differences between available and Required Capital are attributed to Parent Company equity during the year.  

The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory

 environment, for example, to incorporate changes in stress testing or enhancements to modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

Regulatory Developments  

Resolution and Recovery Planning  

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.  

Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2017 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. We submitted our full 2017 resolution plan on June 30, 2017. As indicated in our 2017 resolution plan, the Parent Company has amended and restated its support agreement with its material entities, as defined in our 2017 resolution plan. Under the secured amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its contributable material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities.  

The obligations of the Parent Company under the secured amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material entities against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.  

In December 2017, we received joint feedback on our 2017 resolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The feedback identified no deficiencies in our 2017 resolution plan but noted one shortcoming to be remediated in our next resolution plan submission. 

Further, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have extended the next resolution plan filing deadline for eight large domestic banks, including us, by one year to July 1, 2019.  

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning and Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.  

Legacy Covered Funds under the Volcker Rule  

The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with covered funds, with a number of exemptions and exclusions. In June 2017, we received approval from the Federal Reserve of our application for a five-year extension of the transition period to conform investments in certain legacy Volcker covered funds that are also illiquid funds. The approval covered essentially all of our non-conforming investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule. For more information about the Volcker Rule, see BusinessSupervision and RegulationActivities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule.  

U.S. Department of Labor Conflict of Interest Rule  

The U.S. DOLs final Conflict of Interest Rule under ERISA went into effect on June 9, 2017, with certain aspects subject to phased-in compliance. Full compliance with the rules related exemptions is currently scheduled to be required by July 1, 2019. In addition, the U.S. DOL is undertaking an examination of the rule that may result in changes to the rule or its related exemptions or a change in the full compliance date. For a discussion of the U.S. DOL Conflict of Interest Rule, see BusinessSupervision and RegulationInstitutional Securities and Wealth Management.  

U.K. Referendum  

Following the U.K. electorate vote to leave the E.U., the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, 2017, which triggered a two-year period, subject to extension (which would need the unanimous approval of the E.U. Member States), during which the U.K. government is expected to negotiate its withdrawal agreement with the E.U. For further discussion of U.K. referendums potential impact on our operations, see Risk FactorsInternational Risk. For further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk ManagementCredit RiskCountry Risk Exposure.

 Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Expected Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate  

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and others with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR based on observable market transactions. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years.  

Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates  

To the extent that an increased inflation outlook results in rising interest rates or has negative impacts on the valuation of financial instruments that exceed the impact on the value of our liabilities, it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability. Rising inflation may also result in increases in our non-interest expenses that may not be readily recoverable in higher prices of services offered. Other changes in the interest rate environment and related volatility, as well as expectations about the level of future interest rates, could also impact our results of operations.  

A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, therefore, can affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. For information about cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, see Note 15 to the financial statements.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related financial instruments (e.g., guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.  

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 13 to the financial statements.  

For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see Note 12 to the financial statements. For further information on our lending commitments, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk ManagementCredit RiskLending Activities.  

Contractual Obligations  

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations include certain borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases and purchase obligations.  

Contractual Obligations  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

For further information on Borrowings and Other secured financings, see Note 11 to the financial statements. Amounts presented for Borrowings and Other secured financings are financings with original maturities greater than one year.  

 2.  

Amounts represent estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured borrowings with original maturities greater than one year based on applicable interest rates at December 31, 2017.  

 3.  

Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments related to time deposits primarily held at our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.  

 4.  

For further information on operating leases covering premises and equipment, see Note 12 to the financial statements.  

 5.  

Amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable at this time (see Note 20 to the financial statements for further information).  

Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements, and certain transmission, transportation and storage contracts related to the commodities business. Purchase obligations at December 31, 2017 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected in the balance sheets.
