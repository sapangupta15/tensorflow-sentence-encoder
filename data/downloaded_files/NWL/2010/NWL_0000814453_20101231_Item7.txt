The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  

Business Overview   

Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that touch the lives of people where they work, live and play. The Companys products are marketed under a strong portfolio of brands, including Rubbermaid®, Graco®, Aprica®, Levolor®, Calphalon®, Goody®, Sharpie®, Paper Mate®, Dymo®, Parker®, Waterman®, Irwin®, Lenox® and Technical Concepts. The Companys multi-product offering consists of well-known name-brand consumer and commercial products in three business segments: Home & Family; Office Products; and Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products.  

Business Strategy   

Newell Rubbermaids vision is to become a global company of Brands That Matter and great people, known for best-in-class results. The Company is committed to building consumer-meaningful brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer performance and value. The Companys strategy is to leverage the portfolio for faster growth, build Brands That Matter to drive demand, and fuel growth through margin expansion and scale synergies.  

       Leveraging the portfolio includes accelerating global expansion, targeting investment in higher growth businesses and categories, and acquiring businesses that facilitate geographic and category expansion, thus enhancing the potential for growth and improved profitability.  

       Building Brands That Matter to drive demand involves continued focus on consumer-driven innovation, developing best-in-class marketing and branding capabilities across the organization, and investing in strategic brand-building activities, including investments in research and development to better understand target consumers and their needs.  

       Fueling growth through margin expansion and scale synergies entails continued focus on achieving best cost and improving productivity through the adoption of best-in-class practices, including leveraging scale, optimizing the supply chain to improve capacity utilization and to deliver productivity savings, reducing costs in nonmarket-facing activities, designing products to optimize input costs and utilizing strategic sourcing partners when it is cost effective. Achieving best cost allows the Company to improve its competitive position, generate funds for increased investment in strategic brand-building initiatives and preserve cash and liquidity.  

The Companys core organizing concept is the global business unit (GBU). The Company is organized into 13 GBUs, and each GBU supports one or more of the Companys key brands worldwide, with a focus on developing and marketing differentiated products designed to meet consumers needs. The GBU structure positions the business units to leverage research and development, branding, marketing and innovation on a global basis and facilitates the Companys objective of optimizing working capital and shared resources. The Companys 13 GBUs are aggregated into three operating segments, which are as follows:

Market and Performance Overview  

The Company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets, which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates. The Companys results in 2010 improved compared to 2009 due to an increase in net sales and the expansion of gross margins, despite continuing challenging macroeconomic conditions.  

The Companys results for 2010 were impacted by the following factors:  

       Improvement in economic conditions and increased product penetration internationally, particularly in emerging markets, which contributed to a year-over-year net sales increase of 7.9% in the Companys international businesses, excluding the impact of currency.  

       Productivity gains and favorable product mix, which more than offset the adverse impact of input cost inflation, resulting in a 100-basis-point expansion in gross margins.  

       Ongoing improvements in the cost structure of the business, including the completion of Projection Acceleration, the Companys multi-year restructuring plan designed to achieve best total cost, and reductions in structural selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs resulting from streamlining SG&A activities.  

       Selective spend for strategic SG&A activities to drive sales, enhance the new product pipeline and develop growth platforms. During 2010, the Companys selective spend for strategic brand building and consumer demand creation activities included spend for the following:  

       Rubbermaid Reveal Microfiber Spray Mop that helps consumers clean floors better, while reducing waste and saving money;  

       Goodys Simple Styles collection of hair accessories that make it easy to achieve salon-quality hair styles with only a few simple steps;  

       MimioClassroom system, an integrated suite of interactive teaching tools and services for educators;  

       Sharpie® Liquid Pencil with cutting-edge liquid graphite technology that writes smooth like a pen but erases like a pencil;  

       Expo Washable markers formulated to easily wash off of skin and most washable fabrics;  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Dedicated Parker Shop-in-Shops in key retail locations, primarily located in China, to enhance in-store merchandising;  

       Rubbermaid Commercial Products new line of ergonomically designed material handling carts and trucks, which includes a broad range of solutions that provide enhanced maneuverability and durability;

       Implemented a Capital Structure Optimization Plan to simplify the Companys capital structure, lower interest costs and substantially reduce potential future earnings dilution from the convertible notes resulting in a pretax debt extinguishment charge of $218.6 million during 2010.  

       Began implementation of the European Transformation Plan, which includes projects designed to improve the financial performance of the European business. Projects initiated to date include an evaluation of the pricing architecture and gross-to-net sales optimization and centralization of the leadership of the Companys European operations.  

       Settled a multi-year tax return examination resulting in a tax benefit of $63.6 million.  

Key Initiatives  

European Transformation Plan  

In June 2010, the Company announced a program to simplify and centralize its European business (the European Transformation Plan). The European Transformation Plan includes initiatives designed to transform the European organizational structure and processes to centralize certain operating activities, improve performance, leverage the benefits of scale and to contribute to a more efficient and cost-effective implementation of an enterprise resource planning system in Europe, all with the aim of increasing operating margin in the European region to at least ten percent.  

The European Transformation Plan is expected to result in aggregate restructuring and other plan-related costs of $110 to $115 million, to be substantially incurred by the end of 2011. The European Transformation Plan is expected to be completed in 2012 and is expected to result in cumulative restructuring charges totaling between $40 and $45 million, substantially all of which are employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement, and other termination benefits and relocation costs. The Company also expects to incur an additional $70 to $75 million of selling, general and administrative expenses to implement the European Transformation Plan, of which $15 million has been incurred through December 31, 2010. The Company expects to realize annualized after-tax savings of $55 to $65 million upon completion of the implementation of the European Transformation Plan.  

As part of its European Transformation Plan, the Company expects to start relocating key personnel to Geneva, Switzerland, early in 2011, with all affected employees operational at the new site by the end of 2011. In addition, the Company has undertaken various projects to maximize gross margins and centralize operations in the region.  

Project Acceleration  

The Company completed the implementation of its Project Acceleration restructuring initiative in 2010. Project Acceleration was designed to reduce manufacturing overhead, better align the Companys distribution and transportation processes, and reorganize the overall business structure to align with the Companys core organizing concept, the GBU, to achieve best total cost. Through the Project Acceleration restructuring program and other initiatives, the Company improved capacity utilization rates to deliver productivity savings and increased the use of strategic sourcing partners. In 2010, the Company began implementing a number of restructuring programs as part of Project Acceleration to reduce and realign its manufacturing footprint, including two programs in its Home & Family segment in North America, one program in its Home & Family segment internationally, and one program in its Office Products segment internationally. Since the inception of Project Acceleration, the Company has reduced its manufacturing footprint by more than 60%, including the closure or disposition of 27 manufacturing facilities and the transfer of 19 manufacturing facilities to purchasers in connection with divestitures of businesses.  

As part of Project Acceleration, the Company also evaluated its supply chain to identify opportunities to realize efficiencies in purchasing, distribution and transportation. In 2010, the Company began implementing projects to reduce and realign its distribution footprint, including one multi-segment project in North America, one multi-segment project internationally, and one project in the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segments international operations.  

Project Acceleration also included initiatives to exit and rationalize certain product categories to create a more focused and more profitable platform for growth by eliminating selected low-margin, commodity-like, mostly resin-intensive product categories and reduce the Companys exposure to volatile commodity markets, particularly resin. The product line exits and rationalizations were substantially completed in 2009 and primarily impacted products in the Companys Rubbermaid Consumer and Markers, Highlighters, Art & Office Organization GBUs. Because these product line exits and rationalizations took place throughout 2009, the carryover impact of the product line exits and rationalizations resulted in a 1.4% decline in net sales in 2010 compared to 2009.  

Restructuring costs incurred over the life of the initiative totaled $498 million, including $241 million of employee-related costs, $178 million in non-cash asset-related costs, and $79 million in other associated restructuring costs. Approximately 64% of the total Project

 Acceleration restructuring costs were cash charges. Cumulative annualized savings realized from the implementation of Project Acceleration are expected to exceed $220 million by the end of 2011, after the savings for the projects implemented in 2010 are fully realized.  

One Newell Rubbermaid  

The Company strives to leverage the common business activities and best practices of its GBUs, and to build one common culture of shared values with a focus on collaboration and teamwork. Through this initiative, the Company has established regional shared service centers to leverage nonmarket-facing functional capabilities to reduce costs. In addition, the Company has consolidated the leadership and strategic operations of five of the Companys GBUs into the Companys headquarters facilities to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and better leverage best practices.  

The Company is also migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP global information platform in a phased, multi-year rollout. SAP is expected to enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently. Through December 31, 2010, the North American operations of 12 of the Companys 13 GBUs have successfully gone live with their SAP implementation efforts, including the North American operations of the Rubbermaid Consumer and Rubbermaid Commercial Products GBUs in April 2010. Additional SAP go-lives for certain of the Companys North American operations are scheduled for 2011, and the Companys European operations are expected to go-live on SAP in the first half of 2012.  

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are important in evaluating the Companys operations. The following table sets forth items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Results of Operations  2010 vs. 2009  

Net sales for 2010 were $5,759.2 million, representing an increase of $181.6 million, or 3.3%, from $5,577.6 million for 2009. The following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2010 as compared to 2009 (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Core sales increased 4.7% compared to the prior year resulting from higher volumes primarily due to increases in demand, particularly internationally, and restocking by customers in anticipation of future increases in consumer demand, particularly in the geographic regions and channels where inventories were reduced in late 2008 and early 2009. The higher volumes were also attributable to new products launched during 2010, distribution gains and geographic expansion. Core sales at the Companys North American and international businesses increased approximately 3.6% and 7.9%, respectively, versus the prior year. Last years product line exits reduced year-over-year sales by 1.4% while foreign currency had a negligible impact.  

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2010 was 37.7%, or $2,170.8 million, versus 36.7% of net sales, or $2,049.5 million, for 2009. The primary drivers of the 100 basis point gross margin improvement were productivity gains from several initiatives, including Project Acceleration, and improved product mix, partially offset by input cost inflation.  

SG&A expenses for 2010 were 25.4% of net sales, or $1,463.4 million, versus 24.6% of net sales, or $1,374.6 million for 2009, with currency having a negligible impact on the year-over-year increase. Approximately 30 basis points of the 80 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable to restructuring related charges incurred in connection with the European Transformation Plan in 2010. The remaining increase was mainly due to the Companys increased spend for brand building and other strategic SG&A activities, such as marketing initiatives, advertising and promotions, sales force increases and the implementation of SAP.  

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $77.5 million and $100.0 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in restructuring costs is largely attributable to lower costs associated with reducing the Companys manufacturing and distribution footprint, as the Company completed Project Acceleration in 2010. In addition, the Company incurred lower restructuring costs associated with restructuring programs focused on streamlining the organizational structure to reduce structural SG&A costs. The restructuring costs for 2010 included $6.0 million of facility and other exit costs, $53.6 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $17.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The restructuring costs for 2009 included $32.4 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs, $48.8 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $18.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Operating income for 2010 was 10.9% of net sales, or $629.9 million, versus 10.3% of net sales, or $574.9 million for 2009. The 60 basis point improvement in operating margin is primarily attributable to productivity gains and improved product mix combined with lower restructuring costs and better leverage of structural SG&A as a result of increased sales, partially offset by increased spend for brand building and other strategic SG&A activities and input cost inflation.  

Net nonoperating expenses for 2010 increased $182.9 million to $329.6 million compared to $146.7 million for 2009. During 2010, the Company executed a series of transactions under its Capital Structure Optimization Plan under which losses related to extinguishments of debt of $218.6 million were recognized. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The increase in net nonoperating expenses attributable to the losses associated with the Capital Structure Optimization Plan was partially offset by a $21.6 million decline in interest expense due to lower outstanding debt levels and lower interest rates. In addition, the Company recognized a foreign exchange gain of $5.6 million during 2010 associated with the Companys transition to the SITME rate for remeasuring the Companys Venezuelan assets and liabilities denominated in Bolivar Fuerte. See Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

The Company recognized income tax expense of $7.5 million in 2010 compared to $142.7 million in 2009, representing effective rates of 2.5% and 33.3%, respectively. In 2010, the Company entered into a binding closing agreement related to its 2005 and 2006 U.S. Federal income tax examination, including all issues that were at the IRS Appeals Office, which resulted in a significant reduction to the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $63.6 million including penalties and interest. In addition, the Companys pretax income was $127.9 million lower in 2010 primarily due to charges associated with the Capital Structure Optimization Plan, and the charges were deductible at a higher rate than the Companys overall tax rate. As a result of the charges associated with the Capital Structure Optimization Plan, the Company recognized lower income tax expense and a lower effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Results of Operations  2009 vs. 2008  

Net sales for 2009 were $5,577.6 million, representing a decrease of $893.0 million, or 13.8%, from $6,470.6 million for 2008. The following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2009 as compared to 2008 (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Core sales declined 7.3% compared to the prior year resulting from lower consumer foot traffic and lower product demand as well as inventory destocking at the retail level and in the commercial and industrial channels. Geographically, core sales of the Companys North American and international businesses declined approximately 6% and 11%, respectively, versus the prior year. Planned product line exits and foreign currency contributed an additional 5.2% and 2.1% to the year-over-year sales decline, respectively. The Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions increased sales 0.8% over the prior year.  

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2009 was 36.7%, or $2,049.5 million, versus 32.8% of net sales, or $2,123.2 million, for 2008. The primary drivers of the 390 basis point gross margin expansion included benefits realized from product line exits and rationalizations, moderating input costs compared to 2008 and pricing actions initiated late in 2008 and early 2009. These improvements more than offset the adverse impacts of reduced production volumes in the Companys manufacturing facilities and unfavorable product and customer mix.  

SG&A expenses for 2009 were 24.6% of net sales, or $1,374.6 million, versus 23.2% of net sales, or $1,502.7 million, for 2008. The $128.1 million decrease was primarily driven by the Companys continued management of SG&A spending as well as cost reduction programs initiated during late 2008 and early 2009 to mitigate the negative impact of the decline in sales. Foreign currency translation represented $37.8 million of the $128.1 million decline, which was partially offset by $21.2 million of incremental SG&A costs resulting from the Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions.  

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $100.0 million and $120.3 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys restructuring costs in 2009 related primarily to optimizing the cost structure of the business and secondarily to reducing the Companys manufacturing footprint, whereas the restructuring costs in 2008 primarily related to product line exits and rationalizations and reducing the Companys manufacturing footprint. The restructuring costs for 2009 included $32.4 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs, $48.8 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $18.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The restructuring costs for 2008 included $46.1 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs, $57.5 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $16.7 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

The adverse impact of the macroeconomic environment on the Company during the fourth quarter of 2008, particularly the rapid decrease in consumer demand, combined with the updated outlook for certain of the Companys reporting units led the Company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2008. As a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $299.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain reporting units in the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products and Office Products segments. No similar impairment charges were recorded in 2009.  

Operating income for 2009 was 10.3% of net sales, or $574.9 million, versus 3.1% of net sales, or $200.8 million for 2008. The 720 basis point improvement primarily relates to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, with no similar impairment charges in 2009. The improvement also reflects the favorable impacts of product line exits and rationalizations and moderating input costs in 2009, partially offset by an increase in SG&A costs as a percentage of sales.  

Net nonoperating expenses for 2009 decreased $50.3 million to $146.7 million compared to $197.0 million for 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $52.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to the Companys redemption of its $250.0 million of medium-term Reset notes in July 2008. Interest expense, net, for 2009 was $140.0 million compared to $137.9 million for 2008. The $2.1 million increase in interest expense reflects higher average debt outstanding year-over-year.  

The Company recognized income tax expense of $142.7 million in 2009 compared to $53.6 million in 2008. The increase in tax expense was primarily a result of an increase in income before income taxes in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as the recognition of income tax benefits of $3.1 million and $29.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to favorable outcomes from the IRSs review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired. The impacts of these items were partially offset by the tax impacts of the impairment charges recorded in 2008, because substantially all of the impairment

 charges were not deductible for tax purposes, and accordingly, only nominal tax benefits were recognized in 2008 associated with the impairment charges. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Home & Family  

Net sales for 2010 were $2,378.4 million, an increase of $1.2 million from $2,377.2 million for 2009. Core sales increased 0.5% as core sales growth in the Beauty & Style and Culinary Lifestyle GBUs was partially offset by declines in the Baby & Parenting and Rubbermaid Consumer GBUs. The increase in core sales was largely attributable to consumer-relevant innovation and increased advertising and promotion resulting in shelf space gains and incremental distribution. The impact of product line exits and rationalizations reduced sales by 1.3% while foreign currency had a favorable impact of 0.9%.  

Operating income for 2010 was $281.8 million, or 11.8% of net sales, an increase of $7.1 million, or 2.6%, from $274.7 million, or 11.6% of net sales, for 2009. The slight increase in operating margin is attributable to productivity gains and reduced structural SG&A partially offset by input cost inflation and increased spend on brand building and other strategic initiatives.  

Office Products  

Net sales for 2010 were $1,708.9 million, an increase of $34.2 million, or 2.0%, from $1,674.7 million for 2009. Core sales increased 7.4%, which was primarily attributable to core sales growth across the entire segment with the Technology and Markers, Highlighters, Art & Office Organization GBUs generating double-digit and high single-digit core sales growth, respectively. Product line exits and rationalizations and foreign currency reduced net sales 3.0% and 2.4%, respectively.  

Operating income for 2010 was $269.4 million, or 15.8% of net sales, an increase of $34.2 million, or 14.5%, from $235.2 million, or 14.0% of net sales for 2009. The 180 basis point improvement in operating margin is attributable to productivity gains, improved product mix partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation and a 100 basis point increase in constant currency SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales due to increased spend for strategic brand, volume building and other strategic SG&A activities.

Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products  

Net sales for 2010 were $1,671.9 million, an increase of $146.2 million, or 9.6%, from $1,525.7 million for 2009. Core sales increases accounted for 8.2% of the year-over-year increase, as geographic expansion and international core sales growth were significant contributors to the core sales increase. From a GBU perspective, the Industrial Products & Services and Construction Tools & Accessories GBUs generated mid to high single-digit core sales growth. Favorable foreign currency accounted for 1.4% of the net sales increase.  

Operating income for 2010 was $253.1 million, or 15.1% of net sales, an increase of $7.5 million, or 3.1%, from $245.6 million, or 16.1% of net sales, for 2009. The 100 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to input cost inflation combined with a 50 basis point increase in constant currency SG&A costs as a percentage of sales, as the segments businesses continue to increase spend for brand building and other strategic SG&A activities.

Net sales for 2009 were $2,377.2 million, a decrease of $277.6 million, or 10.5%, from $2,654.8 million for 2008. Core sales declined 2.1% as low-single-digit core sales growth in the Culinary Lifestyle GBU was offset by a high-single-digit decline in the Décor GBU, which continued to be impacted by softness in residential construction, as well as a mid-single-digit decline in the Baby & Parenting GBU, which was adversely impacted by softness in the baby category worldwide. Net sales declined 8.1% due to product line exits and rationalizations in the Rubbermaid Consumer GBU and 1.3% due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The Aprica acquisition increased sales 1.0% compared to the prior year.  

Operating income for 2009 was $274.7 million, or 11.6% of net sales, an increase of $56.4 million, or 25.8%, from $218.3 million, or 8.2% of net sales, for 2008. The 340 basis point improvement in operating margin was primarily due to moderating input costs, product line exits and rationalizations and productivity improvements. In the aggregate, these improvements contributed 450 basis points to the net expansion in operating margin and were partially offset by unfavorable mix and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.

Office Products  

Net sales for 2009 were $1,674.7 million, a decrease of $316.1 million, or 15.9%, from $1,990.8 million for 2008. Core sales declined 6.5%, which was primarily attributable to weak consumer demand both domestically and internationally and inventory destocking at the retail level. Reduced sales relating to product line exits and rationalizations and unfavorable foreign currency contributed an additional 6.0% and 3.4%, respectively, to the year-over-year decline.  

Operating income for 2009 was $235.2 million, or 14.0% of net sales, an increase of $22.8 million, or 10.7%, from $212.4 million, or 10.7% of net sales for 2008. The 330 basis point improvement in operating margin was primarily attributable to product line exits and rationalizations. In constant currency, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008.  

Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products  

Net sales for 2009 were $1,525.7 million, a decrease of $299.3 million, or 16.4%, from $1,825.0 million for 2008. Core sales declined 15.8% as sales volumes were negatively impacted by inventory management by retail, commercial and industrial customers; continued softness in the residential construction market, both domestically and internationally; and sustained weakness in industrial and commercial channels. Unfavorable foreign currency contributed an additional 2.0% decline, and the Technical Concepts acquisition increased sales $26.2 million, or 1.4%, versus the prior year.  

Operating income for 2009 was $245.6 million, or 16.1% of net sales, a decrease of $26.1 million, or 9.6%, from $271.7 million, or 14.9% of net sales, for 2008. The 120 basis point expansion in operating margin was primarily driven by the moderation of input costs compared to the prior year and improved product mix, which combined contributed 190 basis points to the expansion, as well as productivity gains, all of which were partially offset by the adverse impacts of lower production volumes. The lower production volumes were primarily the result of aggressive management of inventory levels by the Companys customers and lower sales resulting from weak demand. In constant currency, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008.

Cash provided by operating activities for 2010 was $582.6 million compared to $602.8 million for 2009. This reduction is primarily attributable to changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, as net changes in working capital generated cash of $237.5 million in 2009, as the Company implemented initiatives to significantly reduce inventory in 2009 due to the global economic downturn. The cash provided by net reductions in working capital in 2009 compared to a use of cash for working capital of $79.0 million in 2010. The year-over-year decline in cash provided by working capital of $316.5 million was offset by the following items:  

       a $55.0 million increase in operating income;  

       an $11.2 million decline in cash paid for interest;  

       a $31.7 million decline in cash paid for income taxes;  

       a $25.0 million decline in voluntary contributions to the Companys primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan, from $75.0 million in 2009 to $50.0 million in 2010; and  

       $126.6 million of cash used in 2009 to settle foreign exchange contracts on intercompany financing arrangements, which is included in accrued liabilities and other in 2009, with similar settlements not occurring in 2010.

Cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was $602.8 million compared to $454.9 million for 2008. This improvement is primarily attributable to working capital improvements, driven mainly by $243.1 million of cash provided by reducing inventories in 2009 compared to $30.9 million in 2008, and an approximate $75.0 million decrease in payments in 2009 compared to 2008 for annual performance-based compensation, which is generally paid in the first quarter of the year based on the previous years results. Cash provided by operating activities for 2009 includes a $75.0 million voluntary cash contribution the Company made to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $126.6 million paid to settle foreign exchange contracts on intercompany financing arrangements and cross-currency interest rate swaps.  

In August 2010, the Company announced a Capital Structure Optimization Plan (the Plan), which was substantially complete as of December 31, 2010 pending the settlement of the Companys accelerated stock buyback expected in March 2011. The Plan included the issuance of $550.0 million of 4.70% senior notes due 2020. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the new notes, cash on hand, and short-term borrowings to fund the repurchase of $500.0 million of shares of its common stock through an accelerated stock buyback program and completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of 10.60% notes due 2019, which resulted in the repurchase of $279.3 million principal amount of the notes. The Company received $544.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the new 4.70% notes due 2020. The aggregate $547.3 million of net proceeds from borrowings during 2010 compares with $634.8 million of net proceeds during 2009, which primarily relate to proceeds from the offering and sale of $300.0 million of 10.60% notes due 2019 and $345.0 million convertible senior notes in March 2009. In connection with the Plan, the Company received $71.1 million of net proceeds associated with the settlement of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions during 2010. Net proceeds from short-term borrowings during 2010 included $100.0 million of borrowings under the Companys receivables facility and $34.0 million of commercial paper, which compares to $70.0 million of borrowings under the receivables and $125.0 million of borrowings under the syndicated revolving credit facility (the Revolver) in 2009.  

The Company received proceeds of $634.8 million and $1,318.0 million from the issuance of debt in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In March 2009, the Company completed the offering and sale of $300.0 million of 10.60% notes due 2019 and $345.0 million convertible senior notes. The $624.3 million of net proceeds from these note issuances were used to complete the tender offers to repurchase $325.0 million principal amount of medium-term notes and purchase convertible note hedge transactions and for general corporate purposes. Also related to the issuance of the convertible senior notes, the Company entered into warrant transactions in which the Company sold warrants to third parties for approximately $32.7 million. During 2009, the Company borrowed and repaid $70.0 million under a 364-day receivables facility that was completed in September 2009 and borrowed and repaid $125.0 million under its Revolver. Proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2008 include $400.0 million of borrowings pursuant to an unsecured three-year term loan (the Term Loan) and $750.0 million from the offering and sale of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500.0 million in 5.50% senior unsecured notes due April 2013 and $250.0 million in 6.25% senior unsecured notes due April 2018. Net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, and net proceeds from the note offering were used to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and for general corporate purposes.  

Uses  

Historically, the Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources have included acquisitions, dividend payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt.  

The Company made aggregate payments on short- and long-term debt of $710.8 million during 2010. In August 2010, the Company completed a cash tender offer for $279.3 million of the $300.0 million principal amount of 10.60% notes due 2019 and paid cash of $402.2 million upon settlement. The Company also completed an exchange offer for $324.7 million of the $345.0 million principal amount of 5.5% convertible notes due 2014 (the Convertible Notes) (the Exchange Offer) and issued 37.7 million shares of common stock and paid cash consideration of $52.0 million to holders accepting the Exchange Offer. The Company paid $1.0 million in fees and expenses associated with the Exchange Offer. The Company made payments on medium-term notes and other debt of $108.6 million and made payments of $200.0 million on its term loan during 2010.  

The Company made aggregate payments on short- and long-term debt of $1,113.0 million during 2009. The $1,113.0 million of repayments in 2009 includes $329.7 million used to complete tender offers to repurchase $180.1 million principal amount of the $250.0 million medium-term notes due December 2009 and $144.9 million principal amount of the $250.0 million medium-term notes due May 2010 (the Tender Offers), the $448.0 million repayment of the floating-rate note issued under the Companys 2001 receivables facility, the repayment of $125.0 million of borrowings under the Revolver, a $50.0 million principal payment on the Term Loan, and the repayment of the remaining $69.9 million principal amount outstanding of the $250.0 million medium-term notes due December 2009. Also, as part of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in March 2009, the Company purchased call options from third parties for $69.0 million. See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the call option transaction.  

The Company made aggregate payments on short- and long-term debt of $772.5 million during 2008. In July 2008, the Company redeemed its $250.0 million of Reset notes due July 2028 for $302.2 million, which includes the Companys purchase of the  

29  

Table of Contents 

 remarketing option embedded in the Reset notes from a third party for $52.2 million. In July 2008, the Company also repaid $65.0 million of its $75.0 million outstanding 6.11% medium-term notes due July 2028 in accordance with the terms of the notes. The Company utilized its commercial paper program to fund the redemption of the Reset notes, the purchase of the remarketing option, and the repayment of the $65.0 million of 6.11% medium-term notes due July 2028. The remaining payments made on debt during 2008 mainly represent the payoff of commercial paper.  

The Company did not invest in significant acquisitions in 2010 and 2009. Cash used for acquisitions was $655.7 million in 2008, which relates primarily to the acquisitions of Technical Concepts and Aprica. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Aggregate dividends paid were $55.4 million, $71.4 million and $234.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

Capital expenditures were $164.7 million, $153.3 million and $157.8 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The largest single capital project in all periods was the implementation of SAP, which represented $45.3 million, $47.2 million and $38.1 million of capital expenditures for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

The Company purchased noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries for $29.2 million during 2009.  

Cash used for restructuring activities is included in changes in accrued liabilities and other in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash used for restructuring activities was $72.8 million, $84.0 million and $60.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which primarily relates to employee termination benefits and relocation costs.  

Financial Position  

The Company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity, managing working capital and monitoring the Companys overall capitalization.  

       Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 were $139.6 million, and the Company had $631.0 million and $100.0 million of borrowing capacity under its Revolver and new receivables facility, respectively.  

       Working capital at December 31, 2010 was $466.1 million compared to $422.6 million at December 31, 2009, and the current ratio at December 31, 2010 was 1.28:1 compared to 1.24:1 at December 31, 2009. The increase in working capital is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable due to higher sales volumes and lower current portion of long-term debt due to the completion of the Capital Structure Optimization Plan.  

       The Company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating total debt to total capitalization. Total debt to total capitalization is defined as the sum of short- and long-term debt, less cash, divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders equity, less cash. Total debt to total capitalization was 0.54:1 at December 31, 2010 and 0.56:1 at December 31, 2009.  

Over the long-term, the Company plans to continue to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results, managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay outstanding debt. The Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the Company may continue to take such actions.  

Borrowing Arrangements  

The Companys Revolver expires in November 2012. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may use the borrowing capacity under the Revolver to provide the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may be issued only up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. However, the Companys current short-term debt credit ratings and access to the credit markets may limit the Companys ability to use the full $665.0 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolver to issue commercial paper. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. As of December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the Revolver, and $631.0 million of borrowing capacity was available under the Revolver.  

The Companys 364-day receivables financing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $200.0 million and matures in September 2011. As of December 31, 2010, aggregate borrowings of $100.0 million were outstanding under the facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.26%, and the remaining $100.0 million was available for borrowing.

The following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the Companys short-term borrowing arrangements during the years ended December 31, (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The indentures governing the Companys medium-term and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants. The Companys borrowing arrangements other than the medium-term and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt-to-total-capitalization ratios. As defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements, minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods. Generally, maximum debt-to-total-capitalization is calculated as the sum of short-term and long-term debt, excluding the junior convertible subordinated debentures, divided by the sum of (i) total debt, (ii) total stockholders equity and (iii) $550.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements, and the Company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the Revolver and the receivables facility and utilize the $731.0 million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debt-to-total-capitalization limits in its financial covenants. A failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the Companys ability to borrow under the Revolver and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness.  

Debt  

The Company has varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business. The volume and timing of production impacts the Companys cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year. Working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through short-term financing arrangements, such as commercial paper or borrowings under the Revolver or receivables facility.  

As of December 31, 2010, the current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt totaled $305.0 million, including the $150.0 million remaining principal amount of the Term Loan due in September 2011, $100.0 million of borrowings under the receivables facility, $34.0 million of commercial paper and $17.5 million of Convertible Notes that remained outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The Company plans to refinance or repay these amounts as they come due using cash flows from operations.  

On August 2, 2010 the Company announced a Capital Structure Optimization Plan (the Plan), which was substantially complete as of December 31, 2010 pending the settlement of the Companys accelerated stock buyback expected in March 2011. The Plan included the issuance of $550.0 million of 4.70% senior notes due 2020. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes, cash on hand and short-term borrowings to fund the repurchase of $500.0 million of shares of its common stock through an accelerated stock buyback program; complete a cash tender offer for $279.3 million of the $300.0 million principal amount of outstanding 10.60% notes due 2019; and complete the exchange of 37.7 million shares of common stock and $52.0 million of cash for $324.7 million of the $345.0 million principal amount of outstanding Convertible Notes. The Company also settled, for $71.1 million cash, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, which were entered into concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes.  

By executing the series of transactions under the Plan, the Company effectively refinanced approximately $550.0 million in long-term debt at lower interest rates, which is expected to generate nearly $35.0 million of annual interest savings based on effective interest rates on the extinguished Convertible Notes and certain medium-term notes of approximately 11.0%, compared to the interest rate on the new debt of 4.7%. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had increased its outstanding common stock by 11.9 million shares, net, and expects the final net increase to be between 9.0 and 10.0 million shares (the final number of shares is subject to change based upon the final settlement of the accelerated stock buyback program, which is scheduled for March 2011). Lastly, the Company substantially eliminated the potential for future share count dilution resulting from the Convertible Notes and related hedge transactions.  

Total debt was $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total debt decreased $139.9 million, primarily due to repayments of $305.1 million for the Companys term loan and certain medium-term notes partially offset by aggregate borrowings of $134.0 million under the Revolver and the receivables financing facility as of December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009 when no amounts were outstanding under either arrangement. The December 31, 2010 debt balance was also affected by the mark-to-market adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixed-rate debt, in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance. The mark-to-market adjustments increased the carrying value of debt by $23.9 million at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.

Reset Notes  

In July 1998, the Company issued $250.0 million of medium-term notes, maturing in July 2028 with interest payable semiannually (the Reset notes). The Reset notes contained a coupon rate reset feature occurring at two ten-year intervals, July 2008 and July 2018. The Reset notes contained a coupon rate of 6.35% through the first interest reset date of July 2008. In addition, the Reset notes contained an embedded remarketing option pursuant to which a third party could call the Reset notes at par at the end of each ten-year remarketing interval, and the third party or another securities dealer could remarket the Reset notes at a reset coupon rate, which would result in the third party realizing proceeds for the remarketed notes in an amount approximately equal to the discounted present value of a $250.0 million ten-year note with a coupon of 5.485%, discounted at the ten-year Treasury note yield to maturity prevailing at the time of remarketing. In the event the remarketing option at the end of each remarketing interval was not exercised, the Reset note holders were required to put the Reset notes back to the Company at a price of par.  

The embedded remarketing option was accounted for separately, as it was deemed a purchase by the Company of a transferable, free-standing call option from the Reset note investors and the Companys concurrent transfer of the free-standing call option to the third party. As a result, the remarketing option, which provided for the call and remarketing of the Reset notes, was in effect a contract between the third party and the Reset note holders that allowed the third party to call the Reset notes from the holders at par at the end of each ten-year remarketing interval and remarket the Reset notes. The fair value of the remarketing option purchased by the Company from the Reset note investors at the date of issuance was determined based on the amount the third party paid the Company for the remarketing option. In summary, at issuance the Company was cash neutral with respect to the remarketing option but implicitly issued the Reset notes at a premium because the investors purchased the Reset notes from the Company simultaneous with the Company purchasing the remarketing option from the investors (which the Company concurrently monetized by selling it to a third party). As a result, the Reset notes carried a premium at issuance, and the Company recognized no gain or loss upon issuance of the Reset notes.  

In connection with the issuance of the Reset notes in July 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with the third party that afforded the Company the right to purchase the remarketing option from the third party at the end of each ten-year remarketing interval at its then fair value in order to avoid the remarketing of the Reset notes. The Company exercised this right in July 2008 to avoid the third party calling and remarketing the Reset notes. The Company redeemed the $250.0 million of Reset notes in July 2008 because prevailing interest rates as of the July 2008 remarketing date would have resulted in the third party exercising the remarketing option and calling the Reset notes at par, and the Reset notes subsequently being remarketed. The Reset notes would have been remarketed at a premium to par in order for the third party to realize the discounted present value described above in the remarketing. A note priced at a premium to par would carry a coupon rate greater than the rate carried by a security priced at par. Accordingly, the coupon rate arising from a potential remarketing was estimated to approximate 9.0%, exceeding the Companys then incremental borrowing rate of 6.25% for comparable debt. To achieve a lower net cost of borrowing, in July 2008, the Company redeemed the Reset notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of the Reset notes of $52.2 million associated with the purchase of the embedded remarketing option from the third party.  

The Company did not have any Reset notes outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.  

Pension Obligations  

The Company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the U.S. and in various other countries. The Companys ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plans assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets. In 2009 and 2010, the Company made voluntary cash contributions of $75.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan in order to improve the overall funded status of the plan. The Company expects to contribute approximately $50.0 million to its worldwide pension and other postretirement plans in 2011 based on minimum contribution requirements.  

Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. The Company determines its plan asset investment mix, in part, on the duration of each plans liabilities. To the extent each plans assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the Company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise, the Company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate.

Dividends  

The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share for the year ended December 31, 2010.  

The payment of dividends to holders of the Companys common stock remains at the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Companys financial condition, earnings, legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.  

Credit Ratings  

The Companys credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. The Companys current senior and short-term debt credit ratings from three credit rating agencies are listed below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Changes in the Companys operating results, cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies, and changes in the ratings may impact the rate of interest payable on certain of the Companys indebtedness. The ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Companys securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of the Companys credit ratings.  

Outlook  

For the year ending December 31, 2011, the Company expects to generate cash flows from operations of more than $550 million after restructuring and restructuring-related cash payments of $90 to $100 million. The Company plans to fund capital expenditures of $180 to $200 million, which include expenditures associated with the implementation of SAP in Europe.  

Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets and availability under the Revolver and receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses. The Company plans to use available cash, borrowing capacity and cash flows from future operations to repay debt maturities as they come due, including $150.0 million principal payment due under the Term Loan in September 2011 and short-term debt of $135.0 million, which includes borrowings under the receivables facility and commercial paper.  

Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies  

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded $79.3 million, $3.1 million and $29.9 million, respectively, in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters. These benefits are reflected in the Companys 2010, 2009 and 2008 Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals, which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows.  

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2010 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.

Table of Contents 

The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions):   

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (2)  Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps that adjust the fixed rate to a floating rate for $1.0 billion of medium-term notes. Interest on floating-rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2010. For further information, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (3)  Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2010. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (4)  Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2010 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms.  

 (5)  Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2010 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt.  

The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits. As a large taxpayer, the Company is under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the $113.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at December 31, 2010 is excluded from the preceding table. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  

Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table. The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of $576.7 million. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $61.6 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self-insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability and medical. See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

As of December 31, 2010, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies.  

Sales Recognition  

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales-related discounts.  

Recovery of Accounts Receivable  

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Accounts are reviewed for potential write-off on a case-by-case basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.  

Inventory Reserves  

The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, including shrink reserves, totaled $18.4 million, $57.0 million and $79.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in cost of products sold. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  

The Company performs its impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Companys goodwill is assigned to the Companys reporting units. Reporting units, which are referred to as the Companys Global Business Units (GBU), are one level below the operating segment level. The GBU is the Companys core organizing concept, and each GBU supports one or more of the Companys key brands worldwide. The Company has not had any material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since January 1, 2009 due to restructuring activities or otherwise. Acquired businesses, if any, including goodwill arising from such transactions, are integrated into the Companys existing reporting units.  

The Company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of $2.7 billion as of July 1, 2010. Five of the Companys 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 70 percent of the Companys total goodwill. These five reporting units were as follows: Baby & Parenting; Rubbermaid Commercial Products; Industrial Products & Services; Markers, Highlighters, Art & Office Organization; and Technology.  

The Company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process. The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. For example, if macroeconomic factors, such as consumer demand and consumer confidence, deteriorate materially such that the Companys reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates, the Company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired. The Company determined that no interim tests of impairment were necessary during 2010 due to declining macroeconomic conditions, significant reductions in reporting units expected sales and profitability, or otherwise.  

In the Companys goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, impairment may be present. Estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing can impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the impairment charge to the extent one is recorded. The Company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing, each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value. For the Companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows, the Company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess their fair value. The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to  

35  

Table of Contents 

 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the Companys internal forecasting process. To determine the EBITDA multiple, the Company obtains information from third parties on EBITDA multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses. The Company also evaluates the EBITDA multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the EBITDA multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the Company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company evaluates the EBITDA multiples used for the reporting units relative to the Companys market capitalization plus an equity control premium. The equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the Companys market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the Company. The Company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium.  

The EBITDA multiple observed in the marketplace for recent transactions ranged from 8 to 10 for the annual impairment test as of July 1, 2010. For the July 1, 2010 impairment test, the Company adjusted the EBITDA multiples from the observed multiples, generally to multiples ranging from 6 to 12 so that the aggregate value of all reporting units relative to the Companys total market value resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium. The Company considers several factors in estimating the EBITDA multiple applicable to each reporting unit, including the reporting units market position, brand awareness, gross and operating margins and prospects for growth, among other factors. After adjusting the EBITDA multiples for the reporting units, no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used. Furthermore, the Companys equity market value at July 1, 2010 of approximately $4.1 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately $1.9 billion. For the impairment test as of July 1, 2010, if each reporting units EBITDA multiple were reduced by 0.5 from the 6 to 12 multiple used for each reporting unit, all reporting units where the EBITDA multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test.  

The Company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances, such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned, is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, has experienced significant losses, is in a stage of hyper-growth, is executing significant restructuring efforts, or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies. The Company used the discounted cash flow approach to value two of its reporting units for the annual impairment test as of July 1, 2010, Baby & Parenting and Hardware, because these reporting units are executing significant restructuring projects, the financial results are significantly impacted by economic cycles and/or the reporting units growth rate is lower than planned. The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit, the discount rate and the working capital investment required. Estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates, raw material costs, currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized. The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk-adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit. In using the discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in 2010, the Company generally used average compound long-term sales growth rates ranging from 2% to 3%, average operating margins of approximately 10% and discount rates of 12% to 14%. The Company concluded these two reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach.  

If the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the Baby & Parenting and Hardware reporting units increased 100 basis points, the estimated fair values of the reporting units would have declined by $70 million and $18 million, respectively. If the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points, the Hardware reporting unit would still have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test, whereas the Baby & Parenting reporting unit would not have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test.  

The Company had one reporting unit, Baby & Parenting, whose estimated fair value at July 1, 2010 exceeded net assets by less than 10% of the reporting units net assets using the adjusted EBITDA multiple or discounted cash flow approach, as applicable. The estimated fair value of Baby & Parenting at July 1, 2010 exceeded net assets by less than 10% of the reporting units net assets using the discounted cash flow approach. The Baby & Parenting reporting unit has goodwill of $425.1 million as of July 1, 2010. If the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Baby & Parenting reporting unit was increased by 100 basis points, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been approximately 7% less than the net assets of the reporting unit. Additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether Baby & Parentings goodwill was impaired, and to the extent goodwill was impaired, the magnitude of the impairment charge.  

The Company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of Baby & Parenting. The Company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and improve its financial performance. To the extent the Company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies, it is possible the Company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with Baby & Parenting in future periods. Baby & Parenting has been adversely affected by the U.S. and Japanese economy and continues to integrate two acquired international businesses. Baby & Parenting has undertaken and is executing restructuring projects to reduce supply chain costs and administrative overhead worldwide and has taken steps to minimize the impact inflation has on its operating results, and to reduce inventories. These efforts are being taken to reduce the working capital investment required in the short-term and improve profitability over the mid- to long-term.

If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company measures the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. The Company identifies unrecognized intangible assets, such as trade names and customer relationships, and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting units recognized and unrecognized intangible assets. The estimated values of the reporting units intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting units total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.  

The Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $315.6 million as of July 1, 2010. The Company assesses the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method, which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the Company to license the use of the trademark or trade name. An impairment charge for indefinite-lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date. The Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1, 2010 and concluded none of the assets were impaired.  

The Company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date, such as whether the Company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name. Based on consideration of these factors, the Company determined that no impairment indicators have been present, and therefore, impairment testing as of a date other than July 1, 2010 is not required.  

See Footnote 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base and net sales, a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the Companys market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity. The Company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the Company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present. The Company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, which could result in impairment charges in the future. If consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future.  

Capitalized Software Costs  

The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Companys management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development. Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal-use software. In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage. Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software. Capitalized software costs were $216.4 million at December 31, 2010. Capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of December 31, 2010.  

The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which typically ranges from three to 12 years. Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used. Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.  

Other Long-Lived Assets  

The Company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Companys strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a  

37  

Table of Contents 

 discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.  

Product Liability Reserves  

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. The Company has product liability reserves of $42.3 million as of December 31, 2010. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Legal and Environmental Reserves  

The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters. The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability (CERCLA) and other matters which are estimated at present value. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2010 ranged between $17.2 million and $29.6 million. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a reserve of $19.3 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Income Taxes  

In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested.  

The Companys income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.  

For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Companys ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Companys effective tax rate as well as impact operating results. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, as discussed below:  

     Discount rates: The Company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high-quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The Company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities.  

     Health care cost trend rate: The Companys health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data, near-term health care outlook, and industry benchmarks and surveys.  

38  

Table of Contents 

     Expected return on plan assets: The Companys expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. The Companys analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long-term, prospective rates of return.  

     Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience.  

     Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increases reflects the Companys long-term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation.  

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Companys pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the assumptions used. The following tables summarize the Companys pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):

The Company used weighted-average discount rates of 5.7% and 5.8% to determine the expenses for 2010 for the pension and postretirement plans, respectively. The Company used a weighted-average expected return on assets of 7.4% to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2010. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The total projected benefit obligations of the Companys pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2010 were $1.45 billion and $166.5 million, respectively. The Company used weighted-average discount rates of 5.3% to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2010. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions):

Table of Contents 

The Company has $425.4 million (after-tax) of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses ($662.5 million pre-tax) included as a reduction to stockholders equity at December 31, 2010. The unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions, changes in discount rates, as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected. The unrecognized gain (loss) for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan. The net amount amortized to expense totaled $13.1 million (pre-tax) in 2010, and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future. Changes in actuarial assumptions, actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain (loss) recognized as expense annually.  

New Accounting Pronouncements  

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and clarified existing disclosure requirements. More specifically, this update requires (a) an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers, and (b) information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements to be presented separately, on a gross basis rather than net, in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). This guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure were effective beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure requirements related to the purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

International Operations  

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Companys non-U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 31%, 30% and 31% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Changes in both U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are shown below for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company began accounting for its Venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in January 2010. Under highly inflationary accounting, the Company remeasures assets, liabilities, sales and expenses denominated in Bolivar Fuertes into U.S. Dollars using the applicable exchange rate, and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys Venezuelan subsidiary had approximately $29.5 million of net monetary assets denominated in Bolivar Fuertes, and as a result, a 5% increase (decrease) in the applicable exchange rate would decrease (increase) the Companys pretax income by $1.5 million.  

In May 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its foreign currency exchange control regulations to close down the parallel exchange market. In early June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system, Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (SITME). Foreign currency exchange through SITME is allowed within a specified band of 4.5 to 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar, but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar. The Company began applying the SITME rate of 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar in May 2010. The transition to the SITME rate from the parallel rate did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated net sales or operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to using the parallel rate for the same period. The transition to the SITME rate did result in a one-time foreign exchange gain of $5.6 million, which is recognized in other income for the year ended December 31, 2010.  

Prior to the use of the SITME rate, the Companys results in Venezuela in 2010 were being reflected in the consolidated financial statements at the parallel exchange rate, and during substantially all of 2009, the Company used the official rate of 2.15 to 1 U.S. Dollar to report the results of its Venezuelan operations. As a result of using the less favorable SITME rate and parallel rate during 2010, consolidated net sales and operating income declined 1% and 3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate the results of the Companys Venezuelan operations. The change in the rate does not impact reported changes in core sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency. Since the introduction of SITME in June 2010, the Venezuelan government has held the rate constant at 5.3  

40

 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar. However, future changes in the rate are possible, and such changes could materially impact the Companys net income, primarily as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses that would result from the change in the rate.  

Fair Value Measurements  

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value, including the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. The authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.  

The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

       Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

       Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  

       Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions.  

The Companys assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments, included in cash and cash equivalents; mutual fund investments, included in other assets; and derivative instruments, primarily included in other assets, other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance. The Company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets (Level 2) and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices (Level 1). The Company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes, and the Companys derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. The Company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 fair value determinations are derived from directly or indirectly observable (market-based) information.
