 Item 1. Business.  

 GENERAL  

Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company located in the Americas that provides its services through the business units described below.  

In the second quarter of 2006, Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) consummated a merger which combined the Duke Energy and Cinergy regulated franchises, as well as deregulated generation in the Midwestern United States.  

Duke Energy Holding Corp. (Duke Energy HC) was incorporated in Delaware on May 3, 2005 as Deer Holding Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation (Old Duke Energy, for purposes of this discussion regarding the merger). On April 3, 2006, in accordance with the merger agreement, Old Duke Energy and Cinergy merged into wholly-owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy HC, resulting in Duke Energy HC becoming the parent entity. In connection with the closing of the merger transactions, Duke Energy HC changed its name to Duke Energy Corporation (New Duke Energy or Duke Energy) and Old Duke Energy converted into a limited liability company named Duke Power Company LLC (subsequently renamed Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas) effective October 1, 2006). As a result of the merger transaction, each outstanding share of Cinergy common stock was converted into 1.56 shares of common stock of Duke Energy, which resulted in the issuance of approximately 313 million shares of Duke Energy common stock. Additionally, each share of common stock of Old Duke Energy was converted into one share of Duke Energy common stock. Old Duke Energy is the predecessor of Duke Energy for purposes of U.S. securities regulations governing financial statement filing. Therefore, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of Old Duke Energy for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005. New Duke Energy had separate operations for the period beginning with the effective date of the Cinergy merger, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to New Duke Energy. Cinergys results have been included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations from the effective date of acquisition and thereafter (see Cinergy Merger in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions). Both Old Duke Energy and New Duke Energy are referred to as Duke Energy hereinafter.  

Cinergy, a Delaware corporation organized in 1993, owns all outstanding common stock of its public utility companies, Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio) and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana), as well as other businesses including cogeneration and energy efficiency investments.  

Duke Energy Ohio, an Ohio corporation organized in 1837, is a combination electric and gas public utility company that provides service in the southwestern portion of Ohio and, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Duke Energy Kentucky, Inc. (Duke Energy Kentucky), in nearby areas of Kentucky. Its principal lines of business include generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, the sale of and/or transportation of natural gas, and power marketing. The regulated operations of Duke Energy Ohio are included in the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas business segment, whereas the unregulated portion of the business is included in the Commercial Power business segment.  

Duke Energy Indiana, an Indiana corporation organized in 1942, is a vertically integrated and regulated electric utility that provides service in central, north central and southern Indiana. Its primary line of business is generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity.  

On January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas businesses, named Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra Energy), including its wholly-owned subsidiary Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Energy Capital, formerly Duke Capital LLC). The natural gas businesses spun off primarily consisted of Duke Energys Natural Gas Transmission business segment and Duke Energys 50% ownership interest in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream, formerly Duke Energy Field Services, LLC), which was part of the Field Services business segment. The results of operations of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods prior to the spin-off. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  

During the third quarter of 2005, Duke Energys Board of Directors authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former Duke Energy North Americas (DENA) remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets. The exit plan was completed in the second quarter of 2006 (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale). As discussed below, certain assets of the former DENA business were transferred to the Commercial Power business segment and certain operations that Duke Energy continues to wind-down are in Other. The results of operations of the former DENA businesses which Duke Energy exited have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods prior to the completion of the exit activities.

PART I  

At December 31, 2007, Duke Energy operated the following business segments, all of which are considered reportable segments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,: U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, Commercial Power, International Energy and Duke Energys 50% interest in the Crescent Resources joint venture (Crescent JV or Crescent). Prior to Duke Energys sale of an effective 50% ownership interest in Crescent in September 2006 (see below), this segment represented Duke Energys 100% ownership of Crescent Resources, LLC. Duke Energys chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information about each reportable business segment, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity in central and western North Carolina, western South Carolina, southwestern Ohio, central and southern Indiana, and northern Kentucky. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas also transports and sells natural gas in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. It conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky. These electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) and the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC).  

Commercial Power owns, operates and manages non-regulated power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Powers generation asset fleet consists of Duke Energy Ohios non-regulated generation in Ohio, acquired from Cinergy in April 2006, and the five Midwestern gas-fired non-regulated generation assets that were a portion of former DENA. Commercial Powers assets comprise approximately 8,020 megawatts of power generation primarily located in the Midwestern U.S. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. Most of the generation asset output in Ohio has been contracted through the Rate Stabilization Plan (RSP). For more information on the RSP, see the Commercial Power section below. Commercial Power also develops and implements customized energy solutions. Commercial Power, through Duke Energy Generation Services, Inc. and its affiliates (DEGS), develops, owns and operates electric generation for large energy consumers, municipalities, utilities and industrial facilities. DEGS currently manages more than 6,600 megawatts of power generation at 23 facilities throughout the U.S. DEGS has 240 megawatts of wind energy under construction and well over 2,500 megawatts of wind energy projects in the development pipeline.  

International Energy owns, operates and manages power generation facilities, and engages in sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas outside the U.S. It conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy International, LLC (DEI) and its activities target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns equity investments in Saudi Arabia and Greece.  

Crescent develops and manages high-quality commercial, residential and multi-family real estate projects primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern U.S. Some of these projects are developed and managed through joint ventures. Crescent also manages legacy land holdings in North and South Carolina.  

On September 7, 2006, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy closed an agreement to create the Crescent JV with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund V U.S., L.P. (MSREF) and other affiliated funds controlled by Morgan Stanley (collectively the MS Members). Under the agreement, the Duke Energy subsidiary contributed all of the membership interests in Crescent to a newly-formed joint venture, which was ascribed an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2005. In conjunction with the formation of the Crescent JV, the joint venture, Crescent and Crescents subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with third party lenders under which Crescent borrowed approximately $1.21 billion, net of transaction costs, of which approximately $1.19 billion was immediately distributed to Duke Energy. Immediately following the debt transaction, the MS Members collectively acquired a 49% membership interest in the Crescent JV from Duke Energy for a purchase price of approximately $415 million. A 2% interest in the Crescent JV was also issued by the joint venture to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Crescent, which is subject to forfeiture if the executive voluntarily leaves the employment of the Crescent JV within a three year period. Additionally, this 2% interest can be put back to the Crescent JV after three years, or possibly earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, at an amount equal to 2% of the fair value of the Crescent JVs equity as of the put date. Therefore, the Crescent JV will accrue the obligation related to the put as a liability over the three year forfeiture period. Accordingly, Duke Energy has an effective 50% ownership in the equity of Crescent JV for financial reporting purposes. Duke Energys investment in the Crescent JV has been accounted for as an equity method investment for periods after September 7, 2006.

The remainder of Duke Energys operations is presented as Other. While it is not considered a business segment, Other primarily includes certain unallocated corporate costs, DukeNet Communications, LLC (DukeNet) and related telecom businesses and Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison), Duke Energys wholly owned, captive insurance subsidiary. Additionally, Other includes the remaining portion of Duke Energys business formerly known as DENA that was not exited or transferred to Commercial Power, primarily Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC (DETM), which management is currently in the process of winding down. Unallocated corporate costs include certain costs not allocable to Duke Energys reportable business segments, primarily governance costs, costs to achieve mergers and divestitures (such as the Cinergy merger and spin-off of Spectra Energy) and costs associated with certain corporate severance programs. DukeNet develops, owns and operates a fiber optic communications network, primarily in the Carolinas, serving wireless, local and long-distance communications companies, internet service providers and other businesses and organizations. Bisons principal activities as a captive insurance entity include the insurance and reinsurance of various business risks and losses, such as workers compensation, property, business interruption and general liability of subsidiaries and affiliates of Duke Energy. On a limited basis, Bison also participates in reinsurance activities with certain third parties.

 U.S. FRANCHISED ELECTRIC AND GAS  

Service Area and Customers  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity and transports and sells natural gas. It conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky (Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky collectively referred to as Duke Energy Midwest). Its service area covers   

7  

Table of Contents 

PART I  

 about 47,000 square miles with an estimated population of 11 million in central and western North Carolina, western South Carolina, southwestern Ohio, central, north central and southern Indiana, and northern Kentucky. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas supplies electric service to approximately 3.9 million residential, commercial and industrial customers over 148,700 miles of distribution lines and a 20,900 mile transmission system. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas provides domestic regulated transmission and distribution services for natural gas to approximately 500,000 customers in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky via approximately 7,100 miles of gas mains (gas distribution lines that serve as a common source of supply for more than one service line) and service lines. Electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities. In addition, municipal and cooperative customers who purchased portions of the Catawba Nuclear Station may also buy power from a variety of suppliers, including Duke Energy Carolinas, through contractual agreements. For more information on the Catawba Nuclear Station joint ownership, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Ownership of Generating and Transmission Facilities.  

Duke Energy Carolinas service area has a diversified commercial and industrial presence. Manufacturing continues to be the largest contributor to the economy in the region. Other sectors such as finance, insurance and real estate services also constitute key components of the states gross domestic product.  

The textile industry, rubber and plastic products, chemicals, and machinery and computer products were the most significant contributors to the areas manufacturing output and Duke Energy Carolinas industrial sales revenue for 2007. Motor vehicle parts, paper, food and beverage, building materials and electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing also have a strong impact on the areas economic growth and the regions industrial sales. The textile industry, while in decline, is the largest industry served in both North Carolina and South Carolina (collectively referred to as the Carolinas).  

Duke Energy Carolinas has business development strategies to leverage the competitive advantages of its service territory to attract and expand advanced manufacturing and data intensive business. These competitive advantages, including a quality workforce, strong educational institutions, superior transportation infrastructure and competitive electric rates 30% below the national average were key factors in attracting new businesses. The success in attracting new companies, as well as expanding the operations of existing customers, substantially offset the sales declines in the industries like textile and furniture in 2007.  

Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Kentuckys service area both have a diversified commercial and industrial presence. Major components of the economy include manufacturing, real estate and rental leasing, wholesale trade, financial and insurance services, retail trade, education, healthcare and professional/business services. Cincinnati, Ohio is positioned to become a healthcare hub and the presence of non-durable manufacturing makes the area less vulnerable to economic fluctuations than other areas.  

The primary metals industry, transportation equipment, chemicals, and paper and plastics were the most significant contributors to the areas manufacturing output and Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Kentuckys industrial sales revenue for 2007. Food and beverage manufacturing, fabricated metals, and electronics also have a strong impact on the areas economic growth and the regions industrial sales.  

Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky have business development strategies to leverage the competitive advantages of the Greater Cincinnati Region to attract and expand advanced manufacturing businesses. The availability of a highly skilled workforce, superior highway access, low cost of living, and proximity to markets and raw materials are key factors in attracting new customers in the transportation, food manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, plastics and data processing industries.  

Industries of major economic significance in Duke Energy Indianas service territory include chemicals, primary metals, and transportation. Other significant industries operating in the area include stone, clay and glass, food products, paper, and other manufacturing. Key sectors among commercial customers include education and retail trade.  

Duke Energy Indiana has business development strategies to leverage the competitive advantages of the Indiana region to attract new advanced manufacturing, logistics, life sciences and data center business to Duke Energy Indianas service territory. These advantages, including competitive electric rates, a strong transportation network, excellent institutions of higher learning, and a quality workforce, were key in attracting new customers and encouraging existing customer expansions. This ability to attract business investment in the service territory helped balance the slight decline in sales in the chemical, food and transportation equipment sector in 2007.  

The number of residential and commercial customers within the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service territory continues to increase. As a result, sales to these customers are increasing due to the growth in these sectors. As sales to residential and commercial customers increase, the level of sales to industrial customers becomes a smaller, yet still significant, portion of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas sales.

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher revenue and cash flows during those periods. By contrast, fewer sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance during those periods. Peak gas sales occur during the winter months.  

The following maps show the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service territories and operating facilities.

Energy Capacity and Resources  

Electric energy for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas customers is generated by three nuclear generating stations with a combined net capacity of 5,020 megawatts (MW) (including Duke Energys 12.5% ownership in the Catawba Nuclear Station), fifteen coal-fired stations with a combined net capacity of 13,552 MW (including Duke Energys 69% ownership in the East Bend Steam Station and 50.05% ownership in Unit 5 of the Gibson Steam Station), thirty-one hydroelectric stations (including two pumped-storage facilities) with a combined net capacity of 3,213 MW, fifteen combustion turbine (CT) stations burning natural gas, oil or other fuels with a combined net capacity of 5,241 MW and two combined cycle (CC) stations burning natural gas or synthetic gas with a combined net capacity of 560 MW. Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, summer reliability, growth, and price. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy, and reliability of power supply.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve native-load customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. The vast majority of customer energy needs are met by large, low-energy-production-cost nuclear and coal-fired generating units that operate almost continuously (or at baseload levels). In 2007, approximately 97.7% of the total generated energy came from U.S Franchised Electric and Gas low-cost, efficient nuclear and coal units (66.5% coal and 31.2% nuclear). The remaining energy needs were supplied by hydroelectric, CT and CC generation or economic purchases from the wholesale market.  

Hydroelectric (both conventional and pumped storage) in the Carolinas and gas/oil CT and CC stations in both the Carolinas and Midwest operate primarily during the peak-hour load periods (at peaking levels) when customer loads are rapidly changing. CTs and CCs produce energy at higher production costs than either nuclear or coal, but are less expensive to build and maintain, and can be rapidly started or stopped as needed to meet changing customer loads. Hydroelectric units produce low-cost energy, but their operations are limited by the availability of water flow.

Table of Contents 

PART I  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas major pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities offer the added flexibility of using low-cost off-peak energy to pump water that will be stored for later generation use during times of higher-cost on-peak generation periods. These facilities allow U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to maximize the value spreads between different high- and low-cost generation periods.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is engaged in planning efforts to meet projected load growth in its service territories. Long-term projections indicate a need for significant capacity additions, which may include new nuclear, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), coal facilities or gas-fired generation units. Because of the long lead times required to develop such assets, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is taking steps now to ensure those options are available. In March 2006, Duke Energy Carolinas announced that it had entered into an agreement with Southern Company to evaluate potential construction of a new nuclear plant at a site jointly owned in Cherokee County, South Carolina. In May 2007, Duke Energy announced its intent to purchase Southern Companys 500 MW interest in the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station, making the plants total output available to Duke Energy Carolinas electric customers. On December 13, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a combined construction and operating license (COL) for two Westinghouse AP1000 (advanced passive) reactors at the Cherokee County, South Carolina site. Each reactor is capable of producing approximately 1,117 MW. Submitting the COL application does not commit Duke Energy Carolinas to build nuclear units. On February 27, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas received confirmation from the NRC that its COL application has been accepted and docketed for the next stage of review. Also, on December 7, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed applications with the NCUC and the PSCSC for approval of Duke Energy Carolinas decision to incur development costs associated with the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station. The NCUC had previously approved Duke Energys decision to incur the North Carolina allocable share of up to $125 million in development costs through 2007. The new requests cover a total of up to $230 million in pre-construction development costs through 2009, which is comprised of approximately $70 million incurred through December 31, 2007 plus an additional $160 million of anticipated costs in 2008 and 2009. The PSCSC has scheduled an evidentiary hearing on Duke Energy Carolinas application for April 17, 2008 and the NCUC has scheduled an evidentiary hearing for April 29, 2008. Also, in December 2006, Duke Energy announced an agreement to purchase a portion of Saluda River Electric Cooperative, Inc.s ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station. Under the terms of the agreement, Duke Energy will pay approximately $158 million for the additional ownership interest of the Catawba Nuclear Station. Following the closing of the transaction, Duke Energy will own approximately 19 percent of Catawba Nuclear Station. This transaction, which is expected to close prior to September 30, 2008, is subject to approval by various state and federal agencies.  

On June 2, 2006, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to construct two 800 MW state of the art coal generation units at its existing Cliffside Steam Station in North Carolina. On February 28, 2007, the NCUC issued a notice of decision approving the construction of one unit at the Cliffside Steam Station. On March 21, 2007, the NCUC issued its Order, which explained the basis for its decision to approve construction of one unit, with an approved cost estimate of $1.93 billion (including allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC)), and certain conditions including providing for updates on construction cost estimates. A group of environmental interveners filed a motion and supplemental motion for reconsideration in April 2007 and May 2007, respectively. Duke Energy opposed the motions and the NCUC denied the motions for reconsideration in June 2007. On January 31, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its updated cost estimate of $1.8 billion (excluding AFUDC of $600 million) for the approved new Cliffside Unit 6. Duke Energy Carolinas believes that the overall cost of Cliffside Unit 6 will be reduced by approximately $125 million in federal advanced clean coal tax credits. On July 11, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into an engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services agreement, valued at approximately $1.3 billion, with an affiliate of The Shaw Group, Inc., of which approximately $950 million relates to participation in the construction of a new 800 MW coal unit, with the remainder related to a flue gas desulfurization system on an existing unit, at Cliffside. On January 29, 2008, the final air permit was issued by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).  

On June 29, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC preliminary CPCN information to construct a 600-800 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility at its existing Dan River Steam Station, as well as updated preliminary CPCN information to construct a 600-800 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility at its existing Buck Steam Station. On December 14, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed CPCN applications for the two combined cycle facilities. The NCUC has consolidated its consideration of the two CPCN applications and scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the applications for March 11, 2008.  

In August 2005, Duke Energy Indiana filed an application with the IURC for approval of study and preconstruction costs related to the joint development of an IGCC project with Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company d/b/a Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. (Vectren). Duke Energy Indiana and Vectren reached a Settlement Agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) providing for the recovery of such costs if the IGCC project is approved and constructed and for the partial recovery of such costs if the IGCC project does not go forward. The IURC issued an order on July 26, 2006 approving the Settlement Agreement in its entirety.

Table of Contents 

PART I  

On September 7, 2006, Duke Energy Indiana and Vectren filed a joint petition with the IURC seeking CPCNs for the construction of a 630 MW IGCC power plant at Duke Energy Indianas Edwardsport Generating Station in Knox County, Indiana. The petition describes the applicants need for additional baseload generating capacity and requests timely recovery of all construction and operating costs related to the proposed generating station, including financing costs, together with certain incentive ratemaking treatment. Duke Energy Indiana and Vectren filed their cases in chief with the IURC on October 24, 2006. As with Duke Energy Carolinas Cliffside project, Duke Energy Indianas estimated costs for the potential IGCC project have increased. Duke Energy Indianas publicly filed testimony with the IURC states that industry estimates (as provided by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)) of total capital requirements for a facility of this type and size are now in the range of $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion (including escalation to 2011 and owners specific site costs). In April 2007, Duke Energy Indiana and Vectren filed a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) Study Report which included an updated estimated cost for the IGCC project of approximately $2 billion (including AFUDC). An evidentiary hearing was held June 18-22, 2007, and a public field hearing was held on August 29, 2007. On November 20, 2007, the IURC issued an order granting Duke Energy Indiana CPCNs for the proposed IGCC project and approved the timely recovery of costs related to the project. The IURC also approved Duke Energy Indianas proposal to initiate a proceeding in May 2008 concerning proposals for the study of partial carbon capture, sequestration and/or enhanced oil recovery for the Edwardsport IGCC Project. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., Sierra Club, Inc., Save the Valley, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc., all intervenors in the CPCN proceeding, have appealed the IURC Order to the Indiana Court of Appeals. That appeal is pending. On January 25, 2008, Duke Energy Indiana received the final air permit from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. In August 2007, Vectren withdrew its participation in the IGCC plant. Duke Energy Indiana is currently exploring its options, including assuming 100% of the plant capacity. Absent identification of an alternative joint owner, Duke Energy Indiana would own 100% of the IGCC plant capacity.  

Fuel Supply  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas relies principally on coal and nuclear fuel for its generation of electric energy. The following table lists U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas sources of power and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2007.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Statistics related to coal generation and all fuels reflect U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas 69% ownership interest in the East Bend Steam Station and 50.05% ownership interest in Unit 5 of the Gibson Steam Station.  

 (b) Statistics related to nuclear generation and all fuels reflect U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas 12.5% ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station.  

 (c) Cost statistics include amounts for light-off fuel at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas coal-fired stations.  

 (d) Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.  

 (e) Includes legacy Cinergy regulated operations from the date of acquisition (April 3, 2006) and thereafter.  

Coal. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas meets its coal demand in the Carolinas and Midwest through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply contracts. Expiration dates for its supply contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range from 2008 to 2016. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. The coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. The coal purchased for the regulated Midwest entities is primarily produced in Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has an adequate supply of coal to fuel its projected 2008 operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected 2009 operations.  

The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas for the Carolinas is approximately 1%; however, as Carolinas coal plants continue to bring on scrubbers over the next several years, the sulfur content of coal purchased could increase as higher sulfur coal options are considered. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas for the Midwest is approximately 2%. Coupled with the use of available sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances on the open market, this satisfies the current emission limitations for SO2 for existing facilities in the Carolinas and Midwest.

Gas. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to native load customers in the Midwest. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies (natural gas intended to be available at all times) and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season (November through March) and during the non-heating season (April through October) through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This strategy allows U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to assure reliable natural gas supply for its high priority (non-curtailable) firm customers during peak winter conditions and provides U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas suppliers under U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas customer choice/gas transportation programs. In 2007, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately 97% of the natural gas supply, with the remaining gas purchased on the spot market. These firm supply agreements feature two levels of gas supply, specifically (1) baseload, which is a continuous supply to meet normal demand requirements, and (2) swing load, which is gas available on a daily basis to accommodate changes in demand due primarily to changing weather conditions.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas also owns two underground caverns with a total storage capacity of approximately 16 million gallons of liquid propane. In addition, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has access to nine million gallons of liquid propane through a storage agreement with a third party. This liquid propane is used in the three propane/air peak shaving plants located in Ohio and Kentucky. Propane/air peak shaving plants vaporize the propane and mix with natural gas to supplement the natural gas supply during peak demand periods and emergencies.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas manages natural gas procurement-price volatility mitigation programs for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. These programs pre-arrange between 25-75% of winter heating season baseload gas requirements and up to 25-50% of summer season baseload requirements up to three years in advance of the delivery month. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky use primarily fixed-price forward contracts and contracts with a ceiling and floor on the price. As of December 31, 2007, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky, combined, had hedged approximately 52% of their winter 2007/2008 base load requirements.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to the gas turbine generators to serve native electric load customers in the Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky service territories. The natural gas procurement strategy is to contract with one or several suppliers who buy spot market natural gas supplies along with firm or interruptible interstate pipeline transportation capacity for deliveries to the site. This strategy allows for competitive pricing, flexibility of delivery, and reliable natural gas supplies to each of the natural gas plants. Many of the natural gas plants can be served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines.  

Duke Energy Indiana hedges a percentage of its winter and summer expected native gas burn from Indiana gas turbine units using financial swaps tied to the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas futures.  

Nuclear. Developing nuclear generating fuel generally involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, enrichment of that gas, and then the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride into usable fuel assemblies.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has contracted for uranium materials and services required to fuel the Oconee, McGuire and Catawba Nuclear Stations in the Carolinas. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements at Oconee, McGuire and Catawba in the near term, but so that its level of coverage decreases over time into the future. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generally sole sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multi-year contracts.  

Based on current projections, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas existing portfolio of contracts will meet the requirements of Oconee, McGuire and Catawba Nuclear Stations through the following years:

PART I  

After the years indicated above, a portion of the fuel requirements at Oconee, McGuire and Catawba are covered by long-term contracts. For requirements not covered under long-term contracts, Duke Energy believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with uranium spot market purchases.  

Duke Energy Carolinas has entered into a contract with Shaw AREVA MOX Services (MOX Services) (formerly Duke COGEMA Stone & Webster, LLC) under which Duke Energy Carolinas has agreed to prepare the McGuire and Catawba nuclear reactors for use of mixed-oxide fuel and to purchase mixed-oxide fuel for use in such reactors. Mixed-oxide fuel will be fabricated by MOX Services from the U.S. governments excess plutonium from its nuclear weapons programs and is similar to conventional uranium fuel. Before using the fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas must apply for and obtain amendments to the facilities operating licenses from the NRC. On March 3, 2005, the NRC issued amendments to Catawba Nuclear Stations operating licenses to allow the receipt and use of four mixed oxide fuel lead assemblies. These four lead assemblies completed their first cycle of irradiation on November 11, 2006 and have been inserted for a second cycle of irradiation in Unit 1 of the Catawba Nuclear Station.  

Energy Efficiency. In May 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an energy efficiency plan with the NCUC that recognizes energy efficiency as a reliable, valuable resource that is a fifth fuel, that should be part of the portfolio available to meet customers growing need for electricity along with coal, nuclear, natural gas, or renewable energy. The plan would compensate Duke Energy Carolinas for verified reductions in energy use and be available to all customer groups. The plan contains proposals for several different energy efficiency programs. Customers would pay for energy efficiency programs with an energy efficiency rider that would be included in their power bill and adjusted annually. The energy efficiency rider would be based on the avoided cost of generation not needed as a result of the success of Duke Energy Carolinas energy efficiency efforts. The plan is consistent with Duke Energy Carolinas public commitment to invest 1% of its annual retail revenues from the sale of electricity in energy efficiency programs subject to the appropriate regulatory treatment of Duke Energy Carolinas energy efficiency investments. A hearing is expected in 2008.  

On September 28, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the PSCSC seeking approval to implement new energy efficiency programs in South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas South Carolina application is based on the application filed in North Carolina. In advance of the evidentiary hearing held February 5-6, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas reached settlement agreements with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS), Wal-Mart, Piedmont Natural Gas and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee. Certain environmental groups that were also interveners on the proceeding did not join any of the settlements. This agreement calls for Duke Energy Carolinas to bear the cost of the programs and allows for recovery of 85% of the avoided generation charges. An evidentiary hearing is expected to be scheduled by the NCUC for North Carolina in 2008.  

Implementation of these plans is subject to approval from the NCUC and PSCSC. As a result, Duke Energy is not able to estimate the impact this plan might have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.  

On July 11, 2007, the PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohios Demand Side Management/ Energy Efficiency Program (DSM Program). The DSM Program consists of ten residential and two commercial programs. Implementation of the programs has begun. The programs were first proposed in 2006 and were endorsed by the Duke Energy Community Partnership, which is a collaborative group made up of representatives of organizations interested in energy conservation, efficiency and assistance to low-income customers. The program costs will be recouped through a cost recovery mechanism that will be adjusted annually to reflect the previous years activity. Duke Energy Ohio is permitted to recover lost revenues, program costs and shared savings (once the programs reach 65% of the targeted savings level) through the cost recovery mechanism based upon impact studies to be provided to the Staff of the PUCO.  

On October 19, 2007, Duke Energy Indiana filed its petition with the IURC requesting approval of an alternative regulatory plan to increase its energy efficiency efforts in the state. Similar to the plans in North Carolina and South Carolina, Duke Energy Indiana seeks approval of a plan that will be available to all customer groups and will compensate Duke Energy Indiana for verified reductions in energy usage. Under the plan, customers would pay for energy efficiency programs through an energy efficiency rider that would be included in their power bill and adjusted annually through a proceeding before the IURC. The energy efficiency rider will be based on the avoided cost of generation not needed as a result of the success of Duke Energy Indianas energy efficiency programs. The IURC is expected to consider the petition in an evidentiary hearing in May 2008.  

On November 15, 2007, Duke Energy Kentucky filed its annual application to continue existing energy efficiency programs, consisting of nine residential and two commercial and industrial programs, and to true-up its gas and electric tracking mechanism for recovery of lost revenues, program costs and shared savings. An order on the application is expected in the first quarter of 2008.

PART I  

Renewable Energy. Climate change concerns, as well as the high price of oil, have sparked rising government support in driving increasing renewable energy legislation at both the federal and state level. For example, the new energy legislation passed in North Carolina in 2007 establishes a renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities at 3% of output by 2012, rising gradually to 12.5% by 2021. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana have issued Request for Proposals seeking bids for power generated from renewable energy sources, including sun, wind, water, organic matter and other sources that can be available as early as 2012.  

Inventory  

Generation of electricity is capital-intensive. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas must maintain an adequate stock of fuel, materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2007, the inventory balance for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas was approximately $817 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information.  

Insurance and Decommissioning  

Duke Energy owns and operates the McGuire and Oconee Nuclear Stations and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station. The McGuire and the Catawba Nuclear Stations each have two nuclear reactors and the Oconee Nuclear Station has three. Nuclear insurance includes: liability coverage; property, decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and business interruption and/or extra expense coverage. The other joint owners of the Catawba Nuclear Station reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance premiums. The Price-Anderson Act requires Duke Energy to provide for public liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the full limit of liability, which is approximately $10.8 billion. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and ContingenciesNuclear Insurance, for more information.  

In 2005, the NCUC and PSCSC approved a $48 million annual amount for contributions and expense levels for decommissioning. During 2007, Duke Energy expensed approximately $48 million and contributed approximately $48 million of cash to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds (NDTF) for decommissioning costs. The entire $48 million was contributed to the funds reserved for contaminated costs as contributions to the funds reserved for non-contaminated costs have been discontinued since the current estimates indicate existing funds to be sufficient to cover projected future costs. The balance of the external funds was $1,929 million as of December 31, 2007 and $1,775 million as of December 31, 2006. These amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds Within Investments and Other Assets.  

Estimated site-specific nuclear decommissioning costs, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, total approximately $2.3 billion in 2003 dollars, based on a decommissioning study completed in 2004. This includes costs related to Duke Energys 12.5% ownership in Catawba Nuclear Station. The other joint owners of Catawba Nuclear Station are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station. The previous study, conducted in 1999, estimated a decommissioning cost of $1.9 billion ($2.2 billion in 2003 dollars at 3% inflation). The estimated increase is due primarily to inflation and cost increases for the size of the organization needed to manage the decommissioning project (based on current industry experience at facilities undergoing decommissioning). Both the NCUC and the PSCSC have allowed Duke Energy to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of Duke Energys nuclear stations. Duke Energy believes that the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with expected fund earnings, are sufficient to provide for the cost of decommissioning.  

After used fuel is removed from a nuclear reactor, it is cooled in a spent-fuel pool at the nuclear station. Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Duke Energy contracted with the Department of Energy (DOE) for the disposal of used nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin accepting used nuclear fuel on January 31, 1998, the date specified by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and in Duke Energys contract with the DOE. In 1998, Duke Energy filed a claim with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the DOE related to the DOEs failure to accept commercial used nuclear fuel by the required date. Damages claimed in the lawsuit are based upon Duke Energys costs incurred as a result of the DOEs partial material breach of its contract, including the cost of securing additional used fuel storage capacity. On March 6, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas and the U.S. Department of Justice reached a settlement resolving Duke Energys used nuclear fuel litigation against the DOE. The agreement provided for an initial payment to Duke Energy of approximately $56 million for certain storage costs incurred through July 31, 2005, with additional amounts reimbursed annually for future storage costs. Duke Energy will continue to safely manage its used nuclear fuel until the DOE accepts it.  

Duke Energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical reimbursements relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by Duke Energy Carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. Duke Energy has third-party insurance to cover certain

 losses related to Duke Energy Carolinas asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of $476 million. Reserves recorded on Duke Energys Consolidated Balance Sheets are based upon the minimum amount in Duke Energys best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through 2027. Management believes it is possible that claims will continue to be filed against Duke Energy Carolinas after 2027. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2027 related to such potential claims. Asbestos-related reserve estimates incorporate anticipated inflation, if applicable, and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. These reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. A significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed, the nature of the alleged injury, and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change managements estimated liability, as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial. A federal legislative solution, further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability. Given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside Duke Energys control, management believes it is reasonably possible that Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of its recorded reserves.  

Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio have also been named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits related to asbestos at their electric generating stations. The impact on Duke Energys financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of these cases to date has not been material. Based on estimates under varying assumptions, concerning uncertainties, such as, among others: (i) the number of contractors potentially exposed to asbestos during construction or maintenance of Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio generating plants; (ii) the possible incidence of various illnesses among exposed workers, and (iii) the potential settlement costs without federal or other legislation that addresses asbestos tort actions, Duke Energy estimates that the range of reasonably possible exposure in existing and future suits over the foreseeable future is not material. This estimated range of exposure may change as additional settlements occur and claims are made and more case law is established.  

See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and ContingenciesAsbestos Related Injuries and Damages Claims, for more information.  

Competition  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas competes in some areas with government-owned power systems, municipally owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and other private utilities. By statute, the NCUC and the PSCSC assign service areas outside municipalities in North Carolina and South Carolina, respectively, to regulated electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives. Substantially all of the territory comprising Duke Energy Carolinas service area has been assigned in this manner. In unassigned areas, Duke Energy Carolinas business remains subject to competition. A decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court limits, in some instances, the right of North Carolina municipalities to serve customers outside their corporate limits. In South Carolina, competition continues between municipalities and other electric suppliers outside the municipalities corporate limits, subject to the regulation of the PSCSC. In Kentucky, the right of municipalities to serve customers outside corporate limits is subject to court approval. In Ohio, certified suppliers may offer retail electric generation service to residential, commercial and industrial customers. In Indiana, the state is divided into certified electric service areas for municipal utilities, rural cooperatives and investor owned utilities. There are limited circumstances where the certified electric service areas can be modified, with approval of the IURC. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas also competes with other utilities and marketers in the wholesale electric business. In addition, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas continues to compete with natural gas providers.  

Regulation  

State  

The NCUC, the PSCSC, the PUCO, the IURC and the KPSC (collectively, the State Utility Commissions) approve rates for retail electric service within their respective states. In addition, the PUCO and the KPSC approve rates for retail gas distribution service within their respective states. The FERC approves U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas cost based rates for electric sales to certain wholesale customers. For more information on rate matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory MattersU.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. The State Utility Commissions, except for the PUCO, also have authority over the construction and operation of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas facilities. CPCNs issued by the State Utility Commissions, as applicable, authorize U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant State Utility Commission is required for Duke Energys regulated operating companies to issue securities.

PART I  

In June 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC seeking authority to increase its rates and charges for electric service in North Carolina effective January 1, 2008. This application complied with a condition imposed by the NCUC in approving the Cinergy merger. On October 5, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Partial Settlement), a settlement agreement among Duke Energy Carolinas, the NCUC Public Staff, the North Carolina Attorney Generals Office, Carolina Utility Customers Association Inc., Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates III and Wal-Mart Stores East LP, for consideration by the NCUC. The Partial Settlement, which includes Duke Energy Carolinas and all intervening parties to the rate case, reflected agreements on all but a few issues in these matters, including two significant issues. The two significant issues related to the treatment of ongoing merger cost savings resulting from the Cinergy merger and the proposed amortization of Duke Energy Carolinas development costs related to GridSouth Transco, LLC (GridSouth), a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) planned by Duke Energy Carolinas and other utility companies as a result of previous FERC rulemakings, which was suspended in 2002 and discontinued in 2005 as a result of regulatory uncertainty. The Partial Settlement and the remaining disputed issues were presented to the NCUC for a ruling.  

The Partial Settlement reflected an agreed to reduction in net revenues and pre-tax cash flows of approximately $210 million and corresponding rate reductions of 12.7% to the industrial class, 5.05% - 7.34% to the general class and 3.85% to the residential class of customers with an effective date of January 1, 2008. Under the Partial Settlement, effective January 1, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas discontinued the amortization of the environmental compliance costs pursuant to North Carolina clean air legislation discussed above and began capitalizing all environmental compliance costs above the cumulative amortization charge of $1.05 billion as of December 31, 2007. Over the past five years, the average annual clean air amortization was $210 million. The Partial Settlement was designed to enable Duke Energy Carolinas to earn a rate of return of 8.57% on a North Carolina retail jurisdictional rate base and an 11% return on the common equity component of the approved capital structure, which consists of 47% debt and 53% common equity. As part of the settlement, Duke Energy Carolinas agreed to alter the then existing bulk power marketing (BPM) profit sharing arrangement that included a provision to share 50% of the North Carolina retail allocation of the profits from certain wholesale sales of bulk power from Duke Energy Carolinas generating units at market based rates. Under the Partial Settlement, Duke Energy Carolinas will share 90% of the North Carolina retail allocation of the profits from BPM transactions beginning January 1, 2008.  

The NCUC issued its Order Approving Stipulation and Deciding Non-Settled Issues on December 20, 2007. The NCUC approved the Partial Settlement in its entirety. The merger savings rider and GridSouth cost matters are discussed in detail below. For the remaining non-settled issues, the NCUC decided in Duke Energy Carolinas favor. With respect to the non-settled issues, the Order required that Duke Energy Carolinas test period operating costs reflect an annualized level of the merger cost savings actually experienced in the test period in keeping with traditional principles of ratemaking. The NCUC explained that because rates should be designed to recover a reasonable and prudent level of ongoing expenses, Duke Energy Carolinas annual cost of service and revenue requirement should reflect, as closely as possible, Duke Energy Carolinas actual costs. However, the NCUC recognized that its treatment of merger savings would not produce a fair result. Therefore, the NCUC preliminarily concluded that it would reconsider certain language in its 2006 merger order in order to allow it to authorize a 12-month increment rider of approximately $80 million designed to provide a more equitable sharing of the actual merger savings achieved on an ongoing basis. Additionally, the NCUC concluded that approximately $30 million of costs incurred through June 2002 in connection with GridSouth and deferred by Duke Energy Carolinas, were reasonable and prudent and approved a ten-year amortization, retroactive to June 2002. As a result of the retroactive impact of the Order, Duke Energy Carolinas recorded an approximate $17 million charge to write-off a portion of the GridSouth costs in 2007. The NCUC did not allow Duke Energy Carolinas a return on the GridSouth investments. As a result of its decision on the non-settled issues, the NCUC ordered an additional reduction in annual revenues of approximately $54 million, offset by its preliminary authorization of a 12-month, $80 million increment rider, as discussed above. The Order ultimately resulted in an overall average rate decrease of 5% in 2008, increasing to 7% upon expiration of this one-time rate rider. On February 18, 2008, the NCUC issued an order confirming their preliminary conclusion regarding the merger savings rider. This order reaffirmed the prior tentative conclusion that the provisions of the Merger Order will not produce a fair sharing of the benefits of estimated merger savings between ratepayers and shareholders and that, for that reason, Duke Energy should be authorized to implement a 12-month increment rider to collect $80 million.  

South Carolina passed new energy legislation which became effective May 3, 2007. Key elements of the legislation include expansion of the annual fuel clause mechanism to include recovery of costs of reagents (ammonia, limestone, etc.) that are consumed in the operation of Duke Energy Carolinas SO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) control technologies and the cost of certain emission allowances used to meet environmental requirements. The cost of reagents for Duke Energy Carolinas in 2008 is expected to be approximately $30 million. With the enactment of this legislation, Duke Energy Carolinas will be allowed to recover the South Carolina portion of these costs, incurred on or after May 3, 2007, through the fuel clause. The legislation also includes provisions to provide assurance of cost recovery related to a utilitys incurrence of project development costs associated with nuclear baseload generation, cost recovery assurance for construction costs associated with nuclear or coal baseload generation, and the ability to recover financing costs for new nuclear base-

 load generation in rates during construction. The North Carolina General Assembly also passed comprehensive energy legislation in July 2007 that was signed into law by the Governor on August 20, 2007. The North Carolina legislation allows utilities to recover the costs of reagents and certain purchased power costs. Like the South Carolina legislation, the North Carolina legislation provides cost recovery assurance for nuclear project development costs as well as baseload generation construction costs. A utility may include financing costs related to construction work in progress for baseload plants in a rate case. The North Carolina legislation also establishes a renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities at 3% of energy output in 2012, rising gradually to 12.5% by 2021, and grants the NCUC authority to approve a rate rider to compensate utilities for energy efficiency programs that they implement. On August 23, 2007, the NCUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to adopt new rules and modify existing rules, as appropriate, to implement the legislation. That proceeding is pending and final rules are expected in the first quarter 2008. At this time, Duke Energy is not able to estimate the impact these legislative initiatives might have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.  

On December 12, 2007, the PSCSC directed the ORS to provide a written report concerning the NCUCs resolution of Duke Energy Carolinas rate application and its relevance to Duke Energy Carolinas rates in South Carolina. The ORS in turn requested information from Duke Energy Carolinas. After review of information supplied by Duke Energy Carolinas and several other documents related to the North Carolina rate case, and after conversations with the North Carolina Public Staff, the ORS filed its report with the PSCSC on January 31, 2008. The ORS concluded that the outcome of the North Carolina rate case had no bearing on Duke Energy Carolinas rates in South Carolina. The PSCSC has not yet responded to the report filed by the ORS.  

Electric generation supply service has been deregulated in Ohio. Accordingly, Duke Energy Ohios electric generation has been deregulated and Duke Energy Ohio is in a competitive retail electric service market in the state of Ohio. Under applicable legislation governing the deregulation of generation, Duke Energy Ohio has implemented a RSP, including a market based standard service offer (MBSSO) approved by the PUCO. The RSP, among other things, allows Duke Energy Ohio to recover increased costs associated with environmental expenditures on its deregulated generating fleet, capacity reserves, and provides for a fuel and emission allowance cost recovery mechanism through 2008. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory MattersU.S. Franchised Electric and Gas - Rate Related Information for additional information.  

On September 25, 2007, at the request of the Governor of Ohio, the Ohio Senate introduced a bill (SB 221) that proposes a comprehensive change to Ohios 1999 electric energy industry restructuring legislation. If enacted, SB 221 would expand the PUCOs authority over generation to: implement the states revised energy policy; regulate electric distribution utility prices for standard service; and permit the PUCO to implement rules for advanced energy portfolio and energy efficiency standards, greenhouse gas emission reporting requirements, and pilot project carbon sequestration activities in conjunction with other state agencies. Under SB 221, electric distribution utilities have the ability to apply for PUCO approval of one of two generation pricing alternatives a market option or an Electric Security Plan (ESP) option. The market option is based upon a competitive bidding process. The ESP option would allow for the recovery of specified costs. The PUCO, however, would have authority to disallow the market option and compel the ESP option. SB 221, if enacted, would limit the ability of a utility to transfer its dedicated generating assets to an exempt wholesale generator absent PUCO approval. SB 221 passed the Ohio Senate on October 31, 2007, and is currently pending before the Ohio House of Representatives.  

Federal  

Regulations of FERC and the State Utility Commissions govern access to regulated electric and gas customer and other data by non-regulated entities, and services provided between regulated and non-regulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of non-regulated affiliates with U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas.  

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into law in August 2005. The legislation directs specified agencies to conduct a significant number of studies on various aspects of the energy industry and to implement other provisions through rulemakings. Among the key provisions, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935, directed FERC to establish a self-regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with FERC oversight, extended the Price Anderson Act for 20 years (until 2025), provided loan guarantees, standby support and production tax credits for new nuclear reactors, gave FERC enhanced merger approval authority, provided FERC new backstop authority for the siting of certain electric transmission projects, streamlined the processes for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines, and reformed hydropower relicensing. In 2005 and 2006, FERC initiated several rulemakings as directed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. These rule makings have now been completed, subject to certain appeals and further proceeding. Duke Energy does not believe that these rulemakings or the appeals will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

PART I  

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and subsequent rulemakings and events initiated the opening of wholesale energy markets to competition. Open access transmission for wholesale transmission provides energy suppliers and load serving entities, including U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and wholesale customers located in the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service area, with opportunities to purchase, sell and deliver capacity and energy at market based prices, which can lower overall costs to retail customers.  

Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana are transmission owners in a regional transmission organization operated by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO), a non-profit organization which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members. In 2005, the Midwest ISO began administering an energy market within its footprint.  

On December 17, 2001 the IURC approved the transfer of functional control of the operation of the Duke Energy Indiana transmission system to the Midwest ISO, an RTO established in 1998. On June 1, 2005, the IURC authorized Duke Energy Indiana to transfer control area operations tasks and responsibilities and transfer dispatch and Day 2 energy markets tasks and responsibilities to the Midwest ISO.  

The Midwest ISO is the provider of transmission service requested on the transmission facilities under its tariff. It is responsible for the reliable operation of those transmission facilities and the regional planning of new transmission facilities. The Midwest ISO administers energy markets utilizing Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e., the energy price for the next MW may vary throughout the Midwest ISO market based on transmission congestion and energy losses) as the methodology for relieving congestion on the transmission facilities under its functional control.  

On December 19, 2005, the FERC approved a plan filed by Duke Energy Carolinas to establish an Independent Entity (IE) to serve as a coordinator of certain transmission functions and an Independent Monitor (IM) to monitor the transparency and fairness of the operation of Duke Energy Carolinas transmission system. Duke Energy Carolinas remains the owner and operator of the transmission system, with responsibility for the provision of transmission service under Duke Energy Carolinas Open Access Transmission Tariff. Duke Energy Carolinas retained the Midwest ISO to act as the IE and Potomac Economics, Ltd. to act as the IM. The IE and IM began operations on November 1, 2006. Duke Energy Carolinas is not currently seeking adjustments to its transmission rates to reflect the incremental cost of the proposal, which is not projected to have a material adverse effect on Duke Energys future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

Other  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is subject to the NRC jurisdiction for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. In 2000, the NRC renewed the operating license for Duke Energys three Oconee nuclear units through 2033 for Units 1 and 2 and through 2034 for Unit 3. In 2003, the NRC renewed the operating licenses for all units at Duke Energys McGuire and Catawba stations. The two McGuire units are licensed through 2041 and 2043, respectively, while the two Catawba units are licensed through 2043. All but one of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC under Part I of the Federal Power Act, with license terms expiring from 2005 to 2036. The FERC has authority to issue new hydroelectric generating licenses. Hydroelectric facilities whose licenses expired in 2005 are operating under annual extensions of the current license until FERC issues a new license. Other hydroelectric facilities whose licenses expire between 2008 and 2016 are in various stages of relicensing. Duke Energy expects to receive new licenses for all hydroelectric facilities with the exception of the Dillsboro Project, for which Duke Energy has filed an application to surrender the license. Duke Energy expects to remove this projects dam and powerhouse, as part of the multi-stakeholder licensing agreement.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state and local environmental agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters in this section.)  

 COMMERCIAL POWER  

Commercial Power owns, operates and manages non-regulated power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Powers generation asset fleet consists of Duke Energy Ohios non-regulated generation in Ohio, acquired from Cinergy in April 2006 and the five Midwestern gas-fired non-regulated generation assets that were a portion of former DENA. Commercial Powers assets are comprised of approximately 8,000 net megawatts of power generation primarily located in the Midwestern United States. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. Most of the generation asset output in Ohio has been contracted through the RSP described below. See Item 2. Properties for further discussion of the generating facilities. Commercial Power also develops and implements customized energy solutions.

PART I  

Commercial Power, through DEGS, is an on-site energy solutions and utility services provider. Primarily through joint ventures, DEGS engages in utility systems construction, operation and maintenance of utility facilities, as well as cogeneration. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of two or more forms of usable energy from a single source. In support of a strategy to increase its renewable energy portfolio, DEGS acquired the wind power development assets of Energy Investor Funds from Tierra Energy in May 2007. Three of the development projects for a total of 240 MW of wind energy acquired from Tierra Energy are anticipated to be in commercial operation in late 2008 or 2009 and are currently under construction. DEGS also has over 2,500 MW of wind energy projects in the development pipeline.  

DEGS also owns coal-based synthetic fuel (synfuel) production facilities which convert coal feedstock into synfuel for sale to third parties. The synfuel produced in these facilities qualified for tax credits through 2007 in accordance with Internal Revenue code Section 29/45K if certain requirements are satisfied. The production of synfuel was ceased at the end of 2007 upon the expiration of the tax credits.  

In October 2006, Duke Energy completed the sale of Commercial Powers energy marketing and trading activities, which were acquired in the Cinergy merger. Additionally, in December 2006, Duke Energy completed the sale of Caledonia Power 1, LLC, which is the project company that operated and managed the Caledonia peaking generation facility in Mississippi.  

In February 2008, Duke Energy entered into an agreement to sell its 480 MW natural gas-fired peaking generating station located near Brownsville, Tennessee to Tennessee Valley Authority. This transaction, which is subject to FERC and other regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2008.  

Competition  

Commercial Power primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, coal, natural gas and emission allowances. The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the energy marketing business. Commercial Powers main competitors include other non-regulated generators in the Midwestern U.S. wholesale power, coal and natural gas marketers, renewable energy companies and financial institutions and hedge funds engaged in energy commodity marketing and trading.

PART I  

Duke Energy Ohio has been charging the MBSSO to non-residential customers since January 1, 2005 and to residential customers since January 1, 2006. The MBSSO charge consists of the following discrete charges:  

       Annually Adjusted Component - intended to provide cost recovery primarily for environmental compliance expenditures. This component is avoidable (or by-passable) by all customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

       Infrastructure Maintenance Fund Charge - intended to compensate Duke Energy Ohio for committing its physical capacity. This charge is avoidable (or by-passable) only by non-residential customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider and agree to remain off the RSP.  

       System Reliability Tracker - intended to provide actual cost recovery for capacity purchases. This charge is by-passable only by non-residential load under certain circumstances.  

       Generation Prices and Fuel Recovery: A market price has been established for generation service. A component of the market price is a fuel cost recovery mechanism that is adjusted quarterly for fuel, emission allowances, and certain purchased power costs that exceed the amount originally included in the rates frozen in the Duke Energy Ohio transition plan. These new prices were applied to non-residential customers beginning January 1, 2005 and to residential customers beginning January 1, 2006.  

       Transmission Cost Recovery: A transmission cost recovery mechanism was established beginning January 1, 2005 for non-residential customers and beginning January 1, 2006 for residential customers. The transmission cost recovery mechanism is designed to permit Duke Energy Ohio to recover certain Midwest ISO charges and all FERC approved transmission costs allocable to retail ratepayers that are provided service by Duke Energy Ohio.   

Regulation  

Commercial Power is subject to regulation at the state level, primarily from PUCO and at the federal level, primarily from FERC. The PUCO approves prices for all retail electric generation sales by Duke Energy Ohio for its native retail service territory. See Regulation section within U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas for additional information regarding deregulation in Ohio.  

Regulations of FERC and the PUCO govern access to regulated electric customer and other data by non-regulated entities, and services provided between regulated and non-regulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of Commercial Power.  

Other ongoing regulatory initiatives at both state and federal levels addressing market design, such as the development of capacity markets and real-time electricity markets, impact financial results from Commercial Powers marketing and generation activities.  

Commercial Power is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters in this section.)  

 INTERNATIONAL ENERGY  

International Energy operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas outside the U.S. It conducts operations primarily through DEI and its activities target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns equity investments in: National Methanol Company (NMC), located in Saudi Arabia, which is a regional producer of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and Attiki Gas Supply S.A. (Attiki), located in Athens, Greece, which is a natural gas distributor and was acquired in connection with the Cinergy merger.  

International Energys customers include retail distributors, electric utilities, independent power producers, marketers and industrial/commercial companies. International Energys current strategy is focused on optimizing the value of its current Latin American portfolio and expanding the portfolio through investment in generation opportunities in Latin America.

PART I  

International Energy owns, operates or has substantial interests in approximately 4,000 net MW of generation facilities. The following map shows the locations of International Energys facilities, including its interest in non-generation facilities in Saudi Arabia and Greece.  

In February 2007, International Energy closed the sale of its 50 percent ownership interest in two hydroelectric power plants near Cochabamba, Bolivia to Econergy International.  

International Energy had an investment in Compañia de Servicios de Compresión de Campeche, S.A. (Campeche), a natural gas compression facility in the Cantarell oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. In August 2007, as a result of the expiration of a gas compression services agreement with the Mexican National Oil Company (PEMEX), ownership of the facility transferred to PEMEX.  

Competition and Regulation  

International Energys sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas competes directly with other generators and marketers serving its market areas. Competitors are country and region-specific but include government owned electric generating companies, local distribution companies with self-generation capability and other privately owned electric generating companies. The principal elements of competition are price and availability, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.  

A high percentage of International Energys portfolio consists of baseload hydro electric generation facilities which compete with other forms of electric generation available to International Energys customers and end-users, including natural gas and fuel oils. Economic activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, weather and other factors affect the supply and demand for electricity in the regions served by International Energy.  

International Energys operations are subject to both country-specific and international laws and regulations. (See Environmental Matters in this section.)
