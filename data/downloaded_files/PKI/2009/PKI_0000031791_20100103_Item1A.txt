Item 1A. Risk Factors   

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:  

If the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.  

Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected

 trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. For example, revenues and profits declined in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008, at least partially, as a result of these factors.  

Our growth is subject to global economic, political and other risks.  

We have operations in many parts of the world. The health of the global economy has a significant impact on our business. Since 2008, worldwide economic conditions have experienced a severe downturn due to the sequential effects of the credit market crisis and the resulting impact on the finance and banking industries, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs, inflation concerns, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital expenditures, and liquidity concerns. For example, the continuing tightening of credit in the financial markets may make it more difficult for customers to obtain financing for their operations, resulting in a material decrease in the orders we receive. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. In addition, our global manufacturing facilities face risks to their production capacity that may relate to natural disasters, labor relations or regulatory compliance. While certain of these risks can be hedged in a limited way using financial instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful. In addition, our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.  

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.  

We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:  

       accurately anticipate customer needs,  

       innovate and develop new technologies and applications,  

       successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,  

       price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and  

       differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings.  

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the  

16

 commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.  

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.  

We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable, or successfully divest businesses.  

We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as Opto Technology Inc., acquired in January 2009, Analytica of Branford, Inc., acquired in May 2009, and Sym-Bio LifeScience Co., Ltd., acquired in August 2009. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including:  

       competition among buyers and licensees,  

       the high valuations of businesses and technologies,  

       the need for regulatory and other approval, and  

       our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.  

Some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, unforeseen regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. Additionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings. As a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term.  

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which expenses may adversely impact our profitability.  

We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.  

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.  

Third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or design around our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend  

17  

Table of Contents 

 against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.  

If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.  

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.  

Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.  

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.  

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.  

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.  

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:  

       demand for and market acceptance of our products,  

       competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,  

       adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,  

       decline in general economic conditions or government funding,  

       adverse income tax audit settlements,  

       differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,  

       fluctuations in our effective tax rate,  

       adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,  

       changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers,  

18  

Table of Contents 

       delays or problems in the introduction of new products,  

       our competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,  

       increased costs of raw materials, energy or supplies,  

       changes in the volume or timing of product orders, and  

       changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions.  

A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.  

We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States, TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers.  

Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components, certain analytical instrumentation and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.  

The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components, analytical instrumentation and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components, analytical instrumentation and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers or strategic relationships to supply critical materials and analytical instrumentation or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components, analytical instrumentation and other goods could usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components, analytical instrumentation or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.  

The manufacture and sale of products may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.  

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.  

Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries. If we fail to comply with those regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of the products produced by our Human Health segment are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.  

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.  

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.  

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.  

The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.  

Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.  

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2010. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:  

       changes in foreign currency exchange rates,  

       changes in a countrys or regions political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,  

       longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,  

       trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,  

       differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,  

20  

Table of Contents 

       adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,  

       differing business practices associated with foreign operations,  

       difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States,  

       difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,  

       differing labor laws and changes in those laws,  

       differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and  

       differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.  

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.  

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.  

Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  

If we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.  

We rely on several centralized information systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.  

Restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.  

Our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6% senior unsecured notes contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These debt instruments include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:  

       pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,  

       sell assets,  

       incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us,  

       guarantee or secure indebtedness,  

       enter into transactions with affiliates, and  

       consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.  

21  

Table of Contents 

Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6% senior unsecured notes may result in an event of default under either or both of these debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under either or both debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.  

Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.  

As of January 3, 2010, our total assets included $1.9 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, core technology and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these itemsspecifically all of those that are considered non-amortizingat least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets.  

Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Human Health and Environmental Health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  

Our share price will fluctuate.  

Over the last several quarters, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:  

       operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors,  

       the financial performance of the major end markets that we target,  

       the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us,  

       announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, and  

       changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.  

Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.  

On October 21, 2009, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, which was paid in January 2010. On January 25, 2010, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 that is payable in May 2010. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.
