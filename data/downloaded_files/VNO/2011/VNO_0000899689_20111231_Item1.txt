Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. 

VorNADO CAPITAL PARTNERS REAL ESTATE FUND (The “FUND”) 

In February 2011, the Fund’s subscription period closed with an aggregate of $800,000,000 of capital commitments, of which we committed $200,000,000. We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year term and a three-year investment period. During the investment period, which concludes in July 2013, the Fund is our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit within its investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such investments; (v) non-controlling interests in equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North America. The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting.  

During 2011, the Fund made three investments (described below) aggregating $248,500,000 and exited two investments. As of December 31, 2011, the Fund has five investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $346,650,000, or $11,995,000 in excess of cost, and has remaining unfunded commitments of $416,600,000, of which our share is $104,150,000.  

 One Park Avenue 

On March 1, 2011, the Fund as a co-investor (64.7% interest), together with Vornado (30.3% interest), acquired a 95% interest in One Park Avenue, a 932,000 square foot office building located between 32nd and 33rd Streets in New York, for $374,000,000. The purchase price consisted of $137,000,000 in cash and 95% of a $250,000,000 five-year mortgage that bears interest at 5.0%.  

Crowne Plaza Times Square 

On December 16, 2011, the Fund formed a joint venture with the owner of the property to recapitalize the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square. The property is located at 48th Street and Broadway in Times Square and is comprised of a 795-key hotel, 14,000 square feet of prime retail space, 212,000 square feet of office space, nine large signage offerings, a 159-space parking garage and a health club. The joint venture plans to reconfigure and reposition the retail and office space as well as add additional signage. Vornado will manage and lease the commercial components of the property and the joint venture partner will asset manage the hotel. This transaction was initiated by us in May 2011, when the Fund acquired a $34,000,000 mezzanine position in the junior most tranche of the property’s mezzanine debt. In December 2011, the Fund contributed $31,000,000 and its partner contributed $22,000,000 of new capital to pay down third party debt and for future capital expenditures. The new capital was contributed in the form of debt that is convertible into preferred equity that receives a priority return and then will receive a profit participation. The Fund has an economic interest of approximately 38% in the property. The Fund’s investment is subordinate to the property’s $259,000,000 of senior debt which matures in December 2013, with a one-year extension option.

The new joint venture’s investment is subordinate to $710,000,000 of third party debt. The new joint venture expects to spend $150,000,000 for re-tenanting and repositioning the Property.

Development and Redevelopment Projects 

We are evaluating various development and redevelopment opportunities which we estimate could require as much as $1.5 billion to be expended over the next five years. These opportunities include: 

· demolition of a 372,000 square foot office building in Crystal City, to construct a 700,000 square foot office building; 

· renovation of the Hotel Pennsylvania; 

· construction of a luxury residential condominium at 220 Central Park South, adjacent to Central Park; 

· re-tenanting and repositioning of 330 West 34th Street; 

· re-tenanting and repositioning of 280 Park Avenue; 

· complete renovation of the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall; and 

· re-tenanting and repositioning a number of our strip shopping centers. 

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, Rosslyn, Pentagon City and Crystal City, for which plans, budgeted costs and financings have yet to be determined. 

Cleveland Medical Mart Development Project 

In 2010, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district. The County is funding the development of the Facility, using the proceeds it received from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective control of the property. During the 17-year development and operating period, our subsidiaries will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which are net of its $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County. Our subsidiaries’ obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by our subsidiaries only to the extent that they first receive at least an equal payment from the County. Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $145,824,000 of the $465,000,000 development budget was expended.  

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.

SEGMENT DATA 

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys “R” Us (“Toys”). Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is set forth in Note 22 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Toys segment has 770 locations internationally.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The New York and Washington, DC Office Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has also experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income.  

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 

Certain Activities 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2011, we have approximately 4,823 employees, of which 322 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 137 employees and an additional 2,816 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York Office and Washington, DC Office properties. The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 457, 168 and 409 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 514 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.7% and 32.4%, respectively.
