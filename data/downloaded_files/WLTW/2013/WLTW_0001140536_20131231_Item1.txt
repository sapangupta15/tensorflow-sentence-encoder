History and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At December 31, 2009, the common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a one-for-one basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The address is:

Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company

c/o Willis Group Limited

The Willis Building

London EC3M 7DQ

For several years, we have focused on our core retail and specialist broking operations. In 2008, we acquired HRH, at the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States. The acquisition almost doubled our North America revenues and created critical mass in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia. In addition, we have made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world and increased our ownership in several of our associates and existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We have significant market positions in the United States, in the United Kingdom and, directly and through our

About Willis

associates, in many other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing specialized risk management advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries including aerospace, marine, construction and energy.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of industries, as well as public institutions and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We have approximately 21,700 employees around the world (including approximately 3,700 at our associate companies) and a network of in excess of 400 offices in nearly 120 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively the global risk management needs of many of our clients.

Retail operations

Our North America and International retail operations provide services to small, medium and large corporate clients, accessing Global's specialist expertise when required.

North America

Our North America business provides risk management, insurance brokerage, related risk services, and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the United States and Canada. With around 100 locations, organized into seven geographical regions including Canada, Willis North America locally delivers our global and national resources and specialist expertise through this retail distribution network.

In addition to being organized geographically and by specialty, our North America business focuses on four client segments: global, large national/middle-market, small commercial, and private client, with service, marketing and sales platform support for each segment.

•Construction 

The largest industry practice group in North America is Construction, which specializes in providing risk management, insurance brokerage, and surety bonding services to the construction industry. Willis Construction provided these services to nearly 12,000 clients including approximately 20 percent of the Engineering News Record Top 400 contractors (a listing of the largest 400 North American contractors based on reported revenue). In addition, this practice group has expertise in professional liability insurance, controlled insurance programs for large projects and insurance for national homebuilders.

•Human Capital

Willis Human Capital, fully integrated into the North America platform, is the Group's largest product-based practice group and provides health, welfare and human resources consulting, and brokerage services to all of our commercial client segments.

International

Our International business comprises our operations in Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America.

Our offices provide services to businesses locally in nearly 120 countries around the world, making use of local expertise as well as skills, industry knowledge and expertise available elsewhere in the Group.

The services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage, specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting.

As part of our on-going strategy, we continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our International market share through acquisitions and strategic investments. A list of significant subsidiaries is included in Exhibit 21.1 to this document.

We have also invested in associate companies; our significant associates at December 31, 2013 were GS & Cie Groupe ('Gras Savoye'), a French organization (30 percent holding) and Al-Futtaim Willis Co. LLC, organized under the laws of Dubai (49 percent holding). In connection with many of our investments we retain the right to increase our ownership over time, typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position. 

We believe the combined total revenues of our International subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our International network. These operations generated approximately 30 percent of the Group’s total consolidated commissions and fees in 2013.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middle-market companies. Further, many of our client relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2013. Additionally, we place insurance with approximately 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2013.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two other major providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.

A particular area of competitive pressure is market-derived income (MDI), which is revenue that insurance intermediaries increasingly have been obtaining from insurance carriers. Contingent commissions are one type of MDI where insurance carriers remunerate intermediates based on either the volume or profitability of risks placed with the carrier. While we have recently stated that we will apply a set of criteria to evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether we will take MDI, and in what form, to date we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers other than in our Human Capital practice. To our knowledge, we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. To the extent that our competitors accept volume- or profit-based continent commissions we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins, and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

About Willis

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria. Our three most significant regulatory regions are described below:

United States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

European Union

The European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the EU on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, our business was previously regulated by the Financial Services Authority ('FSA'). Under legislation enacted by the UK Parliament, the regulation of our business transitioned from the FSA to the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') on April 1, 2013. The FCA has a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement powers, and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements.

The FCA has a sole strategic objective: to protect and enhance confidence in the UK financial system. Its operational objectives are to: secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services; and protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system. The FCA also has a duty to act in a way that promotes competition, and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime. Finally, the FCA has new powers in product intervention. For instance, it can instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions.

Other

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. In the United States, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Willis Capital Markets provides advice on securities or investments in the EU through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Capital Markets & Advisory Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FCA.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United States and United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.
