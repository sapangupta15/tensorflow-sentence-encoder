Competition 

The financial services industry is highly competitive and constantly evolving. BB&T’s subsidiaries compete actively with national, regional and local financial services providers, including banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers, finance companies and insurance companies. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and BHCs. Consumers have the opportunity to select from a variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The industry frequently sees merger activity, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers. For additional information concerning markets, BB&T’s competitive position and business strategies and recent government interventions, see “Market Area” above and “General Business Development” below. 

General Business Development  

BB&T is a regional FHC and has maintained a long-term focus on a strategy that includes expansion of asset size and diversification in terms of revenues and sources of profitability. This strategy encompasses both organic growth and acquisitions of complementary banks and financial businesses. 

Merger and Acquisition Strategy  

BB&T’s growth in business, profitability and market share has historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and acquisitions. Management intends to remain disciplined and focused with regard to future merger and acquisition opportunities. BB&T will continue to assess bank and thrift acquisitions subject to market conditions, primarily within or contiguous to BB&T’s existing footprint, and will pursue economically advantageous acquisitions of insurance agencies, specialized lending businesses, and fee income generating financial services businesses. BB&T’s strategy is currently focused on meeting the following three acquisition criteria: 

 ·must be strategically attractive – meaning that any bank acquisition should be in BB&T’s existing footprint to allow for cost savings and economies of scale or in contiguous states to provide market diversification, or the transaction must be otherwise strategically compelling; 

 ·any risk-related issues would need to be quantified and addressed; and 

 ·the transaction must meet BB&T’s financial criteria. 

During 2014, BB&T completed the purchase of 21 bank branches in Texas, providing $1.2 billion in deposits. BB&T reached an agreement and obtained regulatory approval to acquire 41 additional retail branches in Texas with approximately $2.3 billion in deposits. 

BB&T also reached agreements to acquire The Bank of Kentucky Financial Corporation, which has $1.9 billion in assets, $1.6 billion in deposits and 32 branches with a strong market share in the northern Kentucky/Cincinnati market, and Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., which has $18.7 billion in assets, $13.7 billion in deposits and 245 branches in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, and West Virginia (balances as of December 31, 2014). 

Regulatory Considerations  

The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, FHCs and banks and contains specific information about BB&T. Regulation of banks, BHCs and FHCs is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. As described in more detail below, comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory landscape occurred with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking activities continued in 2014. In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, BB&T is subject to various other laws, regulations, supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of BB&T and its ability to make distributions to shareholders.

Table of Contents  

BB&T’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in state and federal laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to in this section. Proposals to change the laws and regulations to which BB&T is subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on BB&T is impossible to determine with any certainty. The description herein summarizes the significant state and federal laws to which BB&T currently is subject. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions are described in this section, such descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions. 

Financial Regulatory Reform  

During the past several years, there has been a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight for U.S. financial services firms, primarily resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive, complicated and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, representing a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes that affect financial companies, including banks, BHCs and FHCs such as BB&T. 

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. BB&T will continue to evaluate the impact of any new regulations so promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the CFPB and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others. 

As a BHC and a FHC under federal law, BB&T is subject to regulation under the BHCA and the examination and reporting requirements of the FRB. Branch Bank, a North Carolina state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC and the CFPB. 

State and federal law govern the activities in which Branch Bank engages, the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations. Branch Bank also is affected by the actions of the FRB as it implements monetary policy. 

In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities underwriting, dealing, brokerage, investment advisory and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, and supervision and examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, NYSE and various state insurance and securities regulators. 

FHC Regulation  

Under current federal law, as a BHC, BB&T has elected to become a FHC, which allows it to offer customers virtually any type of service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking and activities closely related thereto, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. In order to maintain its status as a FHC, BB&T and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a satisfactory CRA rating. The FRB has responsibility for overseeing compliance with these requirements and monitoring FHC status. If the FRB determines that a FHC is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the FHC has a period of time to comply, but during the period of noncompliance, the FRB can place any limitations on the FHC that it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the FRB determines that a FHC has not maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities. 

Most of the financial activities that are permissible for FHCs also are permissible for a bank’s “financial subsidiary,” except for insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investments and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted by a FHC. In order for a financial subsidiary of a bank to engage in permissible financial activities, federal law requires the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well-capitalized and well-managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.

Table of Contents  

Current federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation under which the FRB is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, but BHC affiliates are principally regulated by functional regulators such as the FDIC for state nonmember bank affiliates, the SEC for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in the bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of functional regulation. Although states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable areas. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes new prudential regulation on depository institutions and their holding companies. As such, BB&T is subject to more stringent standards and requirements with respect to (1) bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers, (2) the “financial activities” in which it engages as a FHC, (3) affiliate transactions and (4) proprietary trading, among other provisions. 

Enhanced Supervision Standards for Systemically Important Financial Institutions 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and establish enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to large, interconnected financial institutions, including BHCs like BB&T, with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (often referred to as systemically important financial institutions). During February 2014, the FRB published the final rule implementing the enhanced prudential standards required to be established under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, risk management and risk committee requirements, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability were they to fail such limits. 

Resolution Planning and Regulation QQ 

FRB and FDIC regulations require “covered companies” such as BB&T and systemically important financial institutions such as Branch Bank to file, maintain and update plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (a “living will”). Both the FRB and the FDIC must review and approve BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s living wills and are authorized to impose restrictions on BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s growth and activities or operations if deemed necessary. The public portions of BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s resolution plans are available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site at www.bbt.com. 

CCAR and Stress Test Requirements 

Current FRB rules require BB&T and other BHCs with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets to submit annual capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios. BB&T and other such BHCs are also required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the FRB to monitor the companies’ progress against their annual capital plans. Covered BHCs, including BB&T, may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the FRB and as to which the FRB has not objected. The rules also require, among other things, that a covered BHC may not make a capital distribution unless, after giving effect to the distribution, it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and have a ratio of Basel I Tier 1 common capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 5%. In addition, effective January 1, 2015, BB&T must maintain a Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 4.5%. See Table 3 for additional information about Basel III requirements. The FRB did not object to BB&T’s 2014 capital plan. The 2015 capital plan was submitted during January 2015. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to conduct an annual supervisory stress test for BHCs, such as BB&T, with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets. The FRB’s stress test rules also require that BB&T (as well as other covered BHCs) conduct a separate mid-year stress test, file the results of such test with the FRB and publicly disclose details of the scenario and the impact on its capital. BB&T’s annual and midcycle stress test results are available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site on www.bbt.com. 

During October 2014, the FRB adopted a rule that amends the capital plan and stress test rules to modify the start date of the capital plan and stress test cycles from October 1 to January 1 of the following calendar year. This rule is effective for 2015. The rule also amends the capital plan rule to limit a BHC’s ability to make capital distributions to the extent the BHC’s actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan under baseline conditions, measured on a quarterly basis.

Table of Contents  

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC to conduct an annual supervisory stress test for FDIC-insured state nonmember banks such as Branch Bank with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets and requires such institutions to conduct annual company-run stress tests. The results of the annual supervisory stress test are included in the annual capital plan submitted to the FDIC. 

The FDIC published rulemaking that revises FDIC rules and regulations regarding the annual stress testing requirements for state non-member banks and state savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion. FDIC regulations, which implement section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, require covered banks to conduct annual stress tests and report the results of such stress tests to the FDIC and the FRB and publicly disclose a summary of the results of the required stress tests. The FDIC modified the “as-of” dates for financial data that covered banks will use to perform their stress tests as well as the reporting dates and public disclosure dates of the annual stress tests. The revisions to the regulations will become effective January 1, 2016. 

Acquisitions  

BB&T complies with numerous laws related to its acquisition activity. Under the BHCA, a BHC may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any BHC or bank or merge or consolidate with another BHC without the prior approval of the FRB. 

Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and BHCs without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to market share limitations and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. These regulatory considerations are applicable to privately negotiated acquisition transactions. 

During 2014, the FRB issued a final rule to implement section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits a financial company from combining with another company if the ratio of the resulting company's liabilities exceeds 10 percent of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies. 

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations  

The FRB has enforcement powers over BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions. 

There also are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance fund in the event the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, under requirements of the FRB with respect to BHC operations, a BHC is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit financial resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. In addition, the “cross-guarantee” provisions of federal law require IDIs under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the DIF as a result of the insolvency of commonly controlled IDIs or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled IDIs in danger of failure. The FDIC’s claim for reimbursement under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the IDI or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and nonaffiliated holders of subordinated debt of the commonly controlled IDI. 

Federal and state banking regulators also have broad enforcement powers over Branch Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the assets of Branch Bank for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks also has the authority to take possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears that such bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its business or has an impairment of its capital stock.

Payment of Dividends; Capital Requirements  

The Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Branch Bank and its subsidiaries. The majority of the Parent Company’s revenue is from dividends paid by Branch Bank. Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, BB&T and Branch Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized elsewhere in this section. Federal banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (1) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. BB&T’s 2015 capital actions will depend on the FRB’s review of BB&T’s 2015 capital plan. 

North Carolina law states that, provided a bank does not make distributions that reduce its capital below its applicable required capital, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of North Carolina may declare such distributions as the directors deem proper. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The federal banking agencies, including the FRB and the FDIC, are required to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions and their BHCs that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five capital categories for IDIs for this purpose: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” To be considered “well-capitalized” under these standards, an institution must maintain the ratios shown above and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

Federal law also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories, with progressively more severe restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed. Additionally, failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital. Federal law further mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards. 

In addition to the “prompt corrective action” directives, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.

U.S. Implementation of Basel III 

During 2013, the FRB published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations known as Basel III. The rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to BHCs and depository institutions, including BB&T and Branch Bank, compared to the current U.S. risk-based capital rules. The rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from Basel I capital accords of the BCBS, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the BCBS's 2004 “Basel II” capital accords. The Basel III rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules. BB&T qualifies as a standardized approach banking organization and must comply with the new requirements beginning on January 1, 2015. Institutions with greater than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in foreign assets are considered advanced approach banking organizations, which requires a more conservative calculation of risk-weighted assets. 

The Basel III rules, among other things, (1) introduce a new capital measure referred to as common equity Tier 1; (2) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of Tier 1 common equity and additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements; (3) define Tier 1 common equity narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to Tier 1 common equity and not to the other components of capital; and (4) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations. 

The Basel III rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

The Basel III rules revise the “prompt corrective action” directives by establishing more conservative ratio levels for well-capitalized status. In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, all banks must hold additional capital, the capital conservation buffer (which is in the form of common equity), to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions, such as dividend payments, discretionary payments on Tier 1 instruments, share buybacks, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, including heads of major business lines and similar employees. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer will be phased-in annually through January 1, 2019. 

During September 2014, the FDIC, FRB and OCC issued a final rule on the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR rule. Under the final rule, BB&T will be considered a “modified LCR” holding company. BB&T would be subject to full LCR requirements if its operations were to fall under the “internationally active” rules, which would generally be triggered if BB&T’s assets were to increase above $250 billion. BB&T implemented balance sheet changes to support its compliance with the rule and to optimize its balance sheet based on the final rule. These actions included changing the mix of the investment portfolio to include more GNMA and U.S. Treasury securities, which qualify as Level 1 under the rule, and changing its deposit mix to increase retail and commercial deposits. Based on management’s interpretation of the final rule, BB&T’s LCR was approximately 130% at December 31, 2014, compared to the regulatory minimum of 90% that will be effective January 1, 2016, which puts BB&T in full compliance with the rule. The regulatory minimum will increase to 100% on January 1, 2017. The final rule requires each financial institution to have a method for determining “operational deposits” as defined by the rule. The number above includes an estimate of operational deposits; however, BB&T continues to evaluate its method to identify and measure operational deposits.

Home Mortgage Disclosure (Regulation C) 

The CFPB published proposed amendments to Regulation C to implement changes to HMDA made by section 1094 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the CFPB proposed several changes to revise the tests for determining which financial institutions and housing-related credit transactions are covered under HMDA. The CFPB also proposes to require financial institutions to report new data points identified in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other data points the CFPB believes may be necessary to carry out the purposes of HMDA. Further, the CFPB proposes to better align the requirements of Regulation C to existing industry standards where practicable. To improve the quality and timeliness of HMDA data, the CFPB proposed to require financial institutions with large numbers of reported transactions to submit their HMDA data on a quarterly, rather than an annual, basis. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards for BHCs and Foreign Banking 

The FRB has adopted amendments to Regulation YY to implement certain components of the enhanced prudential standards required to be established under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendments became effective on June 1, 2014. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, stress-test requirements, and a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The amendments also establish risk committee requirements and capital stress-testing requirements for certain BHCs and foreign banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and Conforming Regulations 

In May 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-33 (the “Notice”) regarding FATCA and its related withholding provisions. The Notice announces that calendar years 2014 and 2015 will be regarded as a transition period for purposes of IRS enforcement and administration with respect to the implementation of FATCA by withholding agents, foreign financial institutions and other entities with IRC chapter 4 responsibilities. The Notice also announces the IRS’s intention to further amend the regulations under Sections 1441, 1442, 1471, and 1472 of the IRC. Prior to the IRS issuing these amendments, taxpayers may rely on the provisions of the Notice regarding the proposed amendments to the regulations. The transition period and other guidance described in the Notice are intended to facilitate an orderly transition for withholding agent and foreign financial institution compliance with FATCA’s requirements and respond to comments regarding certain aspects of the regulations under chapters 3 and 4 of the IRC. BB&T expects to be in compliance with FATCA and its related provisions by the applicable effective dates. 

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker Rule implements section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and prohibits IDIs and affiliated companies ("banking entities") from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, and options on these instruments, for their own account. The final rules also impose limits on banking entities' investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. Like the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules provide exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities, and organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds. The rules also clarify that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian. 

The compliance requirements under the rules vary based on the size of the banking entity and the scope of activities conducted. Banking entities with significant trading operations will be required to establish a detailed compliance program, and their Chief Executive Officers will be required to attest that the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the final rules. Independent testing and analysis of an institution's compliance program also will be required. The final rules reduce the burden on smaller, less-complex institutions by limiting their compliance and reporting requirements. Additionally, a banking entity that does not engage in covered trading activities will not need to establish a compliance program. 

Banking entities must conform proprietary trading activities to the final rule by July 21, 2015. The FRB has extended the compliance deadline to July 21, 2016 for purposes of conforming investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. The FRB also announced its intention to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period for legacy funds to July 21, 2017. These requirements are not expected to have a material impact on BB&T’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments  

Branch Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an IDI based on an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each IDI poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly. 

Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations 

In connection with its lending and leasing activities, Branch Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts.

CFPB 

The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including mortgage origination disclosures, minimum underwriting standards and ability to repay, high-cost mortgage lending, and servicing practices. The rules related to ability to repay, qualified mortgage standards and mortgage servicing became effective in January 2014. The escrow and loan originator compensation rules became effective during 2013. A final rule integrating disclosure required by the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act becomes effective August 1, 2015. As a result of these rules, BB&T transferred the management of certain home equity loans from direct retail lending within the Community Banking segment to the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. 

Interchange Fees 

The FRB adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for such transactions. Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to BB&T and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. 

During 2013, a U.S. Federal District Court judge ruled against the debit card interchange fee limits imposed by the FRB, resulting in the potential for further reductions to these caps. During March 2014, the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the 2013 lower court decision. During January 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which preserved the limits established by the FRB. 

Privacy 

Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions, including substantial customer privacy protections provided under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act). Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 

CRA 

The CRA requires Branch Bank’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” This assessment is reviewed for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or to open or relocate a branch office. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a FHC, such as BB&T, also is assessed by the FRB in connection with any acquisition or merger application.

Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation  

The FRB and FDIC have enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. Regulation E prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Financial institutions must also provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service and the consumer’s choices. In addition, FDIC-supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive or chronic” customer use and undertake “meaningful and effective” follow-up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling 12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily limits on overdraft charges, review and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and ensure board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs. 

Patriot Act  

The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering measures affecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act includes the IMLAFA, which requires such financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions. The U.S. Treasury has issued a number of regulations to implement the Patriot Act, which impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. 

Other Regulatory Matters  

BB&T is subject to examinations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, the FINRA, the NYSE, various taxing authorities and various state insurance and securities regulators. BB&T periodically receives requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state insurance commissions and state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning BB&T’s business and accounting practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.
