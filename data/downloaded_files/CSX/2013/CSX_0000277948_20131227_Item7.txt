Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 31,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. This improved competitiveness is driven by lower domestic energy prices from natural gas, increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors. 

The rail industry benefits from this improved global competitiveness, continued economic growth and the shift towards more rail-based solutions. U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally-efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight about 450 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel, as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion, eases air pollution and saves energy.

CSX's network is positioned to reach nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population, which accounts for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the United States with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States armed forces.

Strategic Growth Opportunities

Intermodal

CSX’s intermodal business is an economical and environmentally-friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the Mississippi River and is 90% cleared for the use of double-stack (two containers high) intermodal movements. This positions the Company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity, estimated at the nine million truckloads in the eastern United States that move over 550 miles. The Company’s highway-to-rail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the U.S. portion of international moves.

CSX is capturing this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas. The Company's Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal, which started operations in 2011, is part of CSX's National Gateway initiative discussed below. This high-capacity terminal expands service offerings to customers, improves market access to and from east coast ports and consumption centers and enhances the fluidity of the network. During 2013, the Company opened or expanded terminals in Columbus, OH; Louisville, KY; Atlanta, GA; and Worcester, MA. The Company expects to open new terminals in Winter Haven, FL and Quebec, Canada in 2014. These projects further enhance the Company's intermodal offering and support future growth.

Illinois Basin Coal Shift

Energy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve. In spite of recent declines in domestic utility coal consumption that primarily resulted from low natural gas prices, coal sourced from mines on the CSX network is now becoming more economical as natural gas prices have rebounded from historic lows. In addition, mining economics are causing a shift from Central Appalachian coal to thermal coal in the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin. To capitalize on these shifts, CSX continues to enhance its network to support these changes, such as adding sidings (track which enables trains on the same line to pass) and increasing yard capacity.

Export Coal

CSX export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy, competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts. Over the past few years, CSX has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation, which is expected to remain high over the long term as developing countries become more urbanized. The Company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand. In addition to the Company’s ready access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities, CSX expects to continue to enhance the operating efficiency of its export coal network which will favorably position the Company to capitalize on growth as it is made available.

New Energy Markets 

The ongoing surge in shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for CSX to serve new energy markets such as crude oil, liquefied petroleum gases (“LPG”), frac sand and other related materials. For example, CSX is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the growing supply of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, to customers at eastern refineries. This service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines. 

CSX’s LPG market is also benefiting from drilling in the Utica Shale region, which underlies portions of Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia. Midstream energy companies, which are involved in the transportation, storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products, are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants (or “fractionators”) in the region. Rail will also play a vital role in moving LPG products from the fractionators to the market. 

CSX’s frac sand market (a key input in the drilling process) has also expanded rapidly over the last few years. The Company has invested in new operating capacity such as railcars and terminals to accommodate this growth, which has been concentrated mainly in the Utica and Marcellus shale regions. The CSX network not only provides access to many frac sand transload terminals located near the drilling activity but also offers the advantage of CSX-direct routes from several key sand producing regions to the frac sand terminals.

PART II

Over the longer term, the improved energy supply outlook for the U.S. will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail. Since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals, the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the U.S. amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world. This increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new U.S. chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade. CSX is well-positioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years.

Operating Initiatives

 In support of these growth opportunities, CSX is focused on meeting customers’ needs while improving profitability. Several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives. Beginning with the ONE Plan, which was implemented nearly ten years ago, the Company is using advanced network modeling analytics and network tools to create a disciplined, scheduled approach to designing and running CSX's merchandise and automotive networks. The service improvements that continue to result from the implementation of the ONE Plan also drove CSX’s ability to deliver strong growth in the intermodal market. The ONE Plan continues to be used to identify the most efficient, cost-effective routes for CSXT customers' traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible. 

The second initiative is Total Service Integration (“TSI”), which is intended to align operating capabilities with customers' needs to reduce loading and unloading times and create more capacity. TSI was first implemented on the unit train network, where it has successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization. CSX is now implementing TSI for the carload network, which focuses on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers, providing a more consistent and reliable service product. The carload network is connected to more than 5,000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day. New tools and technology are allowing the company to more effectively communicate with customers, not only providing the service the Company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status. Applying TSI to the carload network will improve service consistency for each merchandise shipper. 

The third initiative is Service Excellence, which is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service. The initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level, improving the customer experience and allowing CSX to grow the business. This process involves engagement from all operating employees, as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and, ultimately, with the Company’s customers. Higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support CSX’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention, price sustainability and asset utilization. 

The fourth initiative is Enterprise Asset Management (“EAM”), which is a technology system that will help lower total cost of ownership and maximize the productivity and reliability of the railroad’s physical assets. The focus of EAM is on locomotives, cars and infrastructure. Projects are currently in place to deploy technology, improve processes and reduce unproductive time. Because the railroad is an asset intensive industry, EAM helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment, helping proactively schedule maintenance, increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets. The system is also streamlining CSX’s asset management operations to improve the time the asset is in service as well as improving CSX’s return on assets. The intent of this initiative is to deliver operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement.

PART II

Public-Private Partnerships

Expanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. Other examples of the Company’s public-private partnerships are the nearly completed transactions with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of Florida. In both cases, the Company sold a portion of its track to expand freight and commuter rail service, while also alleviating highway congestion. 

Balanced Approach to Cash Deployment 

CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2013, the Company invested $2.3 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2013, the Company announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per common share. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 11 times over the last eight years which represents a 30 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also during 2013, CSX announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program expected to be completed in 2015 based on market and business conditions. CSX repurchased $353 million in shares during 2013 under this new program. Since 2006, CSX has repurchased 287 million shares for $8.3 billion, which represents about one-third of total shares outstanding. The Company also remains committed to an improving investment grade credit profile.

Summary

These strategic growth areas, operating initiatives, long-term investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth, productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principle reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $174 million year over year to $895 million. The primary reason for the increase in free cash flow from the 2012 is due to the prior year contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans which did not repeat in the current year. 

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

PART II

2013 vs. 2012 Results of Operations

Revenue

Volume increased 2% year-over-year as growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset lower coal volume. Total revenue increased by 2% year-over-year driven by this volume growth and pricing gains across most markets. 

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products - Volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of feed grain and ethanol. Feed grain shipments were impacted by low supplier inventories caused by last year’s drought and increased competition from imports. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of increased competition from imports, lower production and competitive losses.

Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by the reopening of a customer mine that led to more short haul phosphates shipments that were previously sourced from an origin not located on CSX’s network.

Food and Consumer - Volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of refrigerated products and alcoholic beverages. The decline in refrigerated products volume was driven by lower potato shipments as a result of more normalized production levels compared to the above-average yields in the prior year, while the decline in alcoholic beverages was primarily driven by a consolidation within a customer’s distribution network that resulted in lower shipments for CSX.

Industrial

Chemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments was due to increased supply of low-cost crude from shale drilling activity, resulting in new shipments to east coast refineries.

Automotive - Finished vehicle shipments increased as North American light vehicle production grew year-over-year. This increase was partially offset by competitive losses in both automotive parts and finished vehicles.

Metals - Volume was flat as a reduction in steel sheet shipments was offset by growth in aluminum products and steel plates. The reduction in shipments of steel sheet, which is used in automotive manufacturing, was driven by competitive losses, mill closures and source shifts. Shipments of aluminum product, which is used in a variety of products like packaging and construction, increased due to modal conversions. Shipments of steel plate, which is used in a wide range of end markets including construction, structural and energy applications, increased in support of continued growth in energy-related markets. 

Housing and Construction

Forest Products - Volume growth was led by an increase in building products due to the continued recovery of the residential housing market.

 28
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Minerals - Volume growth was led by an increase in salt shipments due to modal conversions, new customer distribution terminals and inventory replenishment from more severe winter weather in early 2013 that resulted in more application of salt to roads.

Waste and Equipment - Volume growth was led by waste shipments which were driven by an increase in construction debris due to the continued recovery in construction activity and large scale remediation projects. 

Coal

Export declines were driven by decreased shipments of U.S. thermal coal, as a result of global oversupply and lower coal prices. Shipments of domestic coal declined due to continued low natural gas prices and utility stockpiles above target levels.

Intermodal

Domestic volume growth was driven by continued success with highway-to-rail conversions, growth with existing customers, and service product enhancements. International volume increased due to strength with existing customers and the cycling of disruptions resulting from Hurricane Sandy last year.

Other 

Other revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes. 

Expense

In 2013, total expenses increased $254 million, or 3%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $118 million primarily due to the following items:

•Incentive compensation costs were $89 million higher reflecting higher expected award payouts.

•Inflation increased expenses $61 million.

•Partially offsetting these increases were labor and other costs which decreased $32 million primarily related to improvements in network efficiencies that resulted from the overall reduction in employees, fewer crew starts as well as lower training expenses. 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased $119 million primarily driven by the following:

•Inflation increased expenses $42 million.

•Risk-related costs increased $39 million primarily due to higher expenses related to derailment costs as well as prior year favorable casualty adjustments that did not repeat in 2013.

 29
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

•Volume, materials and services costs increased $19 million primarily due to increased expenses related to higher volume and resource levels.

•Gains recognized decreased $19 million year over year. Gains from last year related to the sale of operating rail corridors to the state of Florida and to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were $104 million. Gains in the current year were $85 million for the sale of operating rail corridor to the state of Florida, a non-monetary exchange of easements and rail assets as well as a deferred gain recognized from a closure arrangement related to a prior conveyance of a formerly-owned company.

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $16 million driven by the following:

•Improved network efficiency and fuel savings initiatives decreased expenses by $38 million.

•Average fuel price per gallon decreased $0.05 to $3.17 per gallon versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $26 million.

•Partially offsetting these decreases were volume-related costs of $31 million as well as other costs of $17 million which includes an adjustment to an interline fuel receivable.

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $45 million primarily due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $12 million primarily due to improved asset utilization partially offset by increased rates and volume.

Interest expense decreased $4 million to $562 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.

Other income - net decreased $62 million to $11 million primarily related to the prior year gain recognized on the sale of a non-operating property that was not repeated in the current year.

Income tax expense decreased $50 million to $1.06 billion primarily due to the year-over-year decrease in earnings before income taxes as well as federal and state legislative changes.

Net earnings increased $1 million to $1.86 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.04 to $1.83 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

2012 vs. 2011 Results of Operations

Revenue

CSX full year results reflect a 1% year-over-year volume decline as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume. Pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets. 

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products - Volume decreased due to reduced shipments of corn and ethanol. Corn shipments for animal feed declined as drought conditions in the Midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher. Further contributing to this decline, customers in the Southeast took advantage of lower cost imported grains and a strong local crop, both of which are transported by truck. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and reduced gasoline demand.

Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume was flat year-over-year. Fertilizer shipments were lower in the first half of the year as the expectation of moderating prices resulted in delayed purchases by farmers. This decline in the first half was offset by growth in fertilizer in the second half resulting from low river levels that shifted business that traditionally moves on barge to rail. Additionally, producers advanced shipments of fertilizer in the fourth quarter in anticipation of an expected increased application by farmers in 2013. 

Food and Consumer - Volume declined year-over-year. Appliance shipments were lower due to intermodal conversions, lower sales incentives by manufacturers and a moderating economy. The decline in appliances was partially offset by growth in refrigerated products due to highway-to-rail conversions.

Industrial

Chemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related markets (that include frac sand, LPG and crude oil) due to the increase in shale drilling activity. Additionally, plastics shipments grew to support growth predominately in automotive and packaging.

Automotive - Volume grew as North American light vehicle production increased 17% to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the U.S. reached record highs.

Metals - Volume was slightly lower primarily due to the decline in scrap shipments as a result of lower steel mill utilization rates and lower scrap exports driven by moderating global demand.

Housing and Construction

Minerals - Volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) resulting from the completion of several construction projects versus the prior year. Additionally, shipments of salt declined in the early part of 2012 as inventories remained high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter.

 32
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Waste and Equipment - Volume declines were led by reduced shipments of military and machinery equipment which were negatively impacted by the expiration of the federal tax credit on the production of wind energy machinery. Additionally, waste shipments decreased as several customer remediation projects were completed.

 Forest Products - Volume increased in building products due to recovering demand for housing and construction, which was partially offset by a decline in the paper markets affected by electronic media substitution.

Coal

Shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices, which drove displacement of coal at utilities served by CSX. In addition, utility stockpiles remained well above target levels and overall electric generation in the eastern U.S. declined. Utility coal declines were partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of U.S. thermal coal. In 2012, CSX shipped 47.8 million tons of export coal.

Intermodal

Intermodal volume increased due to growth in both domestic and international markets. Domestic shipment growth resulted from highway-to-rail conversions and increased demand from both new and existing customers. International growth was driven by a new customer and expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the Northwest Ohio terminal. 

Expenses

In 2012, total expenses decreased $26 million compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $53 million due to the following:

•Incentive compensation expense decreased $55 million reflecting lower expected award payouts.

•Crew labor costs decreased $42 million as a result of the decline in volume as well as efficiencies gained from management's action to reduce resources. 

• These decreases were partially offset by increased costs of $44 million primarily driven by wage inflation and increased pension and other post-employment benefit expense.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense decreased by $73 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:

•Gains recognized increased $102 million year-over-year, primarily related to the additional recognition of the deferred gain from the prior year sale of an operating corridor to the state of Florida of $80 million. 

•Continued improvement in safety trends lowered casualty expenses by $19 million. 

 33
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

•Various other costs also decreased $17 million.

•As a result of efficiency initiatives and the decline in volume, expenses decreased $12 million primarily related to lower material and repair costs due to the reduction of active locomotives.

•Partially offsetting the above decreases in expenses were inflation of $47 million and a few costly derailments of $30 million, although the number of train accidents continued to decline. 

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Overall, fuel expense increased $4 million due to a 4% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel, partially offset by decreased volume and improved network efficiency. 

•Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.12 to $3.18 in 2012 versus 2011, which drove fuel expense $60 million higher versus the prior year. 

•Partially offsetting this increase is $56 million of savings related to decreased volume, improved network efficiency, fuel saving initiatives and the decline in non-locomotive fuel.

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $83 million due to the following items:

•A larger asset base related to higher capital spending drove expenses $66 million higher versus 2011.

• A prior year favorable adjustment to asset retirements and other of $17 million was not repeated in 2012.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $13 million primarily due to the following:

•Higher automotive volume-related costs increased expenses by $24 million. 

•Various other costs increased $33 million.

•These increases were partially offset by savings of $44 million associated with improved asset utilization.

Interest expense increased $14 million to $566 million primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates. The primary use of proceeds from the 2012 debt issuances was for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness due in both 2012 and early 2013 as well as a contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans.

Other income - net increased $51 million to $73 million primarily related to a gain on the sale of a non-operating real estate.

Income tax expense increased $22 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings during 2012 and the cycling of prior year state income tax related adjustments.

Net earnings increased $9 million to $1.9 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.12 to $1.79 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

 At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety. During 2013, the FRA reportable personal injury frequency index increased 23 percent year over year to 0.86 and underscores the need for continued progress. However, CSX continues to remain a leader in a very safe industry. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 12 percent year over year to 1.83 reflecting continued momentum in accident reduction. 

Network reliability and service metrics continued to show year over year improvements during 2013. While on-time originations remained flat at 89 percent, on-time arrivals improved 1 percent to 81 percent, average train velocity increased 2 percent to 23.2 miles per hour and dwell improved 6 percent to 22.2 hours.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows

Consolidated Balance Sheets

CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.

Total assets increased $1.1 billion from prior year primarily due to the increase in net properties of $1.2 billion resulting from capital investments. This increase was partially offset by the decline in cash and short-term investments of $292 million. 

Total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined increased $1.1 billion. This increase was primarily due to net earnings of $1,864 million and the increase in deferred income taxes of $566 million primarily related to accelerated tax depreciation as well as the tax impact of the unrecognized gain related to pension and other post-employment benefits plans which was recorded in 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of $600 million, share repurchases of $353 million and a net reduction in total debt of $277 million. 

Sources of Cash

The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2013, the Company generated $3.3 billion of cash from operating activities which increased $321 million from prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $275 million contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans in the prior year that did not repeat. In 2012, the Company generated $2.9 billion of cash from operating activities which decreased $545 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by a pension plan contribution as mentioned above, higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements in 2012. 

Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.

CSX filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 15, 2013. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.

Uses of Cash

CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2013 and 2012, net cash used in investing activities was driven by $2.3 billion of property additions for both years.

 The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Total capital expenditures shown above include investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships. These investments are for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 

 Planned capital investments for 2014 are expected to be $2.3 billion, including expected spending of approximately $300 million for PTC. This $2.3 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. Over half of the 2014 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars, and high return projects that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives that improve the returns of the business, such as intermodal terminal capacity projects. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. 

Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be at least $1.7 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2013 was $875 million.

PART II

In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $1,232 million, which was an increase in spending of $564 million. This increase was driven by higher debt repayments and a lower amount of debt issued, partially offset by lower share repurchases. In 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $668 million, which was a decrease in spending of $745 million. Share repurchases were lower by $830 million and partially offsetting this were higher dividend payments of $78 million as a result of an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.14 per share in second quarter 2012. 

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 

Liquidity and Working Capital

Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2013, CSX issued a total of $500 million of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock and dividends to shareholders. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. 

The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364-day term and expires in December 2014. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. The Company anticipates either renewing the facility or replacing it with another liquidity-based solution. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.

Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $178 million and $308 million at December 2013 and 2012, respectively. This decline since the prior year is primarily due to cash used for capital investments, dividends paid, share repurchases and long-term debt repaid which more than offset cash from operations. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings have improved during 2013. Currently, CSX is rated BBB+ with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's, compared to a rating of BBB with a positive outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's at December 2012. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:

•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;

•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;

•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and

•income taxes. 

Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves

Casualty

Casualty reserves of $280 million in 2013 represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $50 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves.

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Personal Injury

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.

CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.

During 2013 and 2012, there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves. Adjustments to the reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Occupational & Asbestos

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.

The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.

Occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party actuary or specialist (the "third-party specialist"), respectively, in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Occupational claims analyses are performed by the third-party specialist quarterly and are reviewed by management. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly and the review by the third-party specialist is completed annually. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.

The third-party specialists analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX's employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the third-party specialists provide an estimate of the IBNR claims liability.

 41
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims.

During 2013 and 2012, there were no significant changes in estimates recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves. Adjustments in reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Environmental

Environmental reserves were $100 million for 2013. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 244 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.

In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:

•type of clean-up required;

•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);

•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and

•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

 These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

 42
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required.

Legal

In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.  As of December 2013, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans were $2.7 billion and $350 million, respectively. During 2012, the Company made a contribution of $275 million to its qualified pension plans, of which $25 million was the required minimum contribution. At this time, the Company anticipates that no further contributions to its qualified pension plans will be required in 2014.

In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:

•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;

•long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•salary scale inflation rates; and

•other assumptions.

The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, salary scale inflation rates and other assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.

Discount Rates

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2013 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. For 2012, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 3.75% and 3.20%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2013, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.50% and 7.75% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Salary Scale Inflation Rates

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 3.75% to value its 2013 and 2012 pension obligations.

Other Assumptions

The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management.

2014 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense

Net pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2014 is expected to be approximately $58 million and $21 million, respectively, compared to $95 million and $29 million, respectively, in 2013. The decrease in pension expense is primarily related to an increase in the discount rate and favorable asset experience.

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2013 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method

The Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 86% of total fixed assets of $37 billion on a gross basis at December 2013. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.

The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.

 45
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.

Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. The Company plans to perform a road and track asset depreciation study during 2014. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.

Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.

There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:

•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;

•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;

•evaluation of current operations;

•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;

•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;

•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and

•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.

 46
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).

Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.1 billion and $1 billion for 2013 and 2012, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. 

Income Taxes

CSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2011. The federal income tax return for 2012 is currently under review. During 2013, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2013. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2013, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $23 million.
