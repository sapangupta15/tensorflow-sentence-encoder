Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2009 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 The challenging global recession continues to provide significant headwinds for our business. We continue to operate in a soft insurance pricing market, as property and casualty rates continue to decline. In addition to pricing declines, volume is negatively impacted by the current economic environment, which places pressure on our business in three primary ways:    

declining insurable risks due to decreasing asset values, including property values, shipment volumes, payroll and number of active employees,   

client cost-driven behavior, where clients are actively looking to reduce spending in order to meet budget reductions, and increase risk retention, as a result of prioritizing their total spending, and   

sector specific weakness, including financial services, construction, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions, all of which have been particularly impacted by the current recession.   

 Our revenue for 2009 was negatively impacted as a result of this difficult market environment. We continue to demonstrate expense discipline, holding expenses to last year's levels while we continue to invest in our businesses.  

 We have made three key commitments to shareholders  grow organically, expand margins, and increase earnings per share. The following is our measure of performance against these three metrics for 2009:    

Organic revenue, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, declined 1% as a result of weak economic conditions globally.   

Achieved an adjusted pretax margin, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, of 17.2% for Aon overall, 20% for the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, and 17.4% for the Consulting segment.   

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Aon's stockholders increased 7% to $2.19 per share in 2009, from $2.04 per share in 2008.   

Additionally, the following is a summary of our 2009 financial results:    

Revenue increased $67 million, or 1%, to $7.6 billion, as additional revenue from the Benfield merger and other acquisitions was mainly offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation and $97 million lower fiduciary investment income due to the decline in global interest rates.   

Operating expenses of $6.6 billion were comparable with last year, as favorable foreign currency translation, restructuring and other operational expense savings, lower E&O costs resulting from insurance recoveries, a net pension curtailment gain recognized in 2009 of $78 million related to the decision to cease crediting future benefits relating to salary and service in our U.S. and Canada defined benefit pension plans, and a reduction in incentive compensation were offset by the increased expenses associated with the Benfield merger and other acquisitions and higher restructuring charges.   

Our consolidated operating margin from continuing operations for the year improved from 12.5% in 2008 to 13.4% in 2009. The increase was principally driven by a 1% growth in revenue, along with expense management.   

Net income from continuing operations attributable to Aon stockholders increased 2% or $15 million from 2008 to $636 million.

 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

 General  

 In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted pretax margin, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results.  

 Organic Revenue Growth  

 We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items. Supplemental information related to organic growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Statements of Income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages to the reported Commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages, has been provided in the "Review by Segment" caption, below.  

 Adjusted Pretax Margins  

 We use adjusted pretax margin as a measure of core operating performance of our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting businesses. Adjusted pretax margin excludes the impact of restructuring charges and certain non-recurring costs such as pension curtailments, costs for anti-bribery and compliance initiatives and Benfield integration costs. This supplemental information related to adjusted pretax margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Statements of Income. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported pretax margin is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations  

 Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our  

26 

operations, we have provided a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating last year's revenue, expenses and net income at this year's foreign exchange rates.  

 Summary of Results  

 The consolidated results of continuing operations follow (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consolidated Results for 2009 Compared to 2008  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $67 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase reflects a $108 million, or 2%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $49 million increase associated with corporate ownership in insurance investments obtained as part of the acquisition of Benfield Group Limited ("Benfield") in November 2008, partially offset by an $89 million, or 7%, decrease in the Consulting segment. This 2% increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment was primarily driven by increased commissions and fees attributable to Benfield, partially offset by a $95 million decrease in fiduciary investment income due to declines in global interest rates, the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decline in organic revenue reflecting the weak economic conditions globally. The 7% decrease in the Consulting segment was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a 2% decline in organic revenue reflecting the impact of the economic downturn, and the impact of the previously announced termination of an outsourcing contract with AT&T.  

27 

           Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased by $16 million, essentially even with 2008. This increase reflects a $70 million, or 2%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $7 million, or 12%, increase in unallocated expenses, partially offset by a $61 million, or 7%, decrease in the Consulting segment. The slight increase overall from last year was driven by the impact of Benfield and higher restructuring costs, which were offset by favorable foreign currency translation, restructuring savings, gains related to the pension curtailments and lower incentive compensation.  

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses decreased by $30 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease reflects a $16 million, or 1%, decline in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $23 million, or 7%, decrease in the Consulting segment, partially offset by a $9 million increase in unallocated expenses. The overall decline was driven by favorable foreign exchange, lower E&O expenses due to insurance recoveries, restructuring savings, operational expense management, and reduced costs related to our FCPA and anti-corruption reviews and related compliance initiatives. These items exceeded the impact of Benfield, including increased intangible amortization related to the merger, and higher restructuring charges.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income, which represents income earned on operating cash balances and miscellaneous income-producing securities, decreased $64 million from 2008 and was driven mainly by lower investment balances, the global decline in interest rates in 2009 and a decrease in income from our Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC ("PEPS I") investment.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense declined $4 million, due primarily to the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates, which was mostly offset by higher interest rates following the third quarter issuance of €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of long-term debt at a 6.25% coupon, which replaced debt borrowed at lower rates under our Euro credit facility.  

 Other Income (Expense)  

 Other income (expense) was $20 million of income for 2009 versus an expense of $29 million in 2008. This change reflects a $7 million decrease in income in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, a $1 million increase in income in the Consulting segment, and a $55 million reduction in unallocated expenses. The $7 million decline in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment was primarily driven by a gain on the sale of land recognized in 2008 of $5 million and lower earnings from our non-consolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by higher gains on the disposal of several small subsidiaries. The $55 million improvement in unallocated expenses was due to $50 million of costs recognized in 2008 associated with acquiring Benfield, along with a $5 million gain recognized in 2009 on the extinguishment of $15 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $949 million, an 8% increase from $879 million in 2008. The improvement was driven by the additional earnings from Benfield and other acquisitions, restructuring and other operational expense savings, and the net pension curtailment gain, which more than offset the impact of higher restructuring costs, lower fiduciary investment and interest income and unfavorable foreign currency translation.  

28 

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.2% and 27.5% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase reflects the changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations increased to $681 million ($2.19 diluted net income per share) from $637 million ($2.04 diluted net income per share) in 2008. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted income from continuing operations in 2009 by $0.02 per diluted share when the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2009 foreign exchange rates. Income from continuing operations in 2008 was positively impacted by $0.16 per diluted share due to currency fluctuations between 2007 and 2008.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 Income from discontinued operations decreased $730 million to $111 million ($0.38 diluted net income per share) in 2009 from $841 million ($2.76 diluted net income per share) in 2008. The 2009 results include the recognition of a $55 million foreign tax carryback related to the sale of CICA, the gain on the sale of AIS, results from our P&C operations through the date of disposal, a curtailment gain on the post-retirement benefit plan related to the CICA disposal, and residual tax settlements related to our AWG disposal. The 2008 results include the gain on the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries ($935 million) and the operations of CICA and Sterling for the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by a loss recognized on our remaining P&C operations.  

 Consolidated Results for 2008 Compared to 2007  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $294 million, or 4%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase principally reflects a $279 million, or 5%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and an $11 million, or 1%, increase in the Consulting segment. The 5% increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment was primarily driven by organic growth in our reinsurance and most of our retail operations, as well as the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates. The small increase in the Consulting segment was primarily driven by growth in most major practice groups and geographies, mostly offset by the negative impact of the terminated outsourcing contract with AT&T.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased by $240 million, or 6%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase reflects a $250 million, or 7%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, which more than offset an $8 million, or 1%, decline in the Consulting segment and a $2 million, or 3%, decrease in unallocated expenses. The overall 6% increase was primarily driven by higher restructuring expenses, the impact of acquisitions, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and higher salaries and incentive costs, partially offset by restructuring and pension expense savings.  

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses increased by $117 million, or 6%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase reflects a $137 million, or 9%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, partially offset by a $9 million, or 3%, decrease in the Consulting segment and an $11 million decrease in unallocated expenses. The increase was driven by higher E&O expenses, costs related to our FCPA and anti-corruption reviews and related compliance initiatives, increased restructuring charges, higher  

29 

expense due to increased amortization resulting from recent acquisitions, and higher depreciation from restructuring-related impairments and higher software amortization. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains and one-time expenses in 2007 relating to the settlement of litigation for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income decreased $6 million, or 6%, from 2007, resulting from lower non-liquidating distributions from our PEPS I investment of $29 million and lower global interest rates, partially offset by interest income on higher invested balances from selling CICA and Sterling.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense declined $12 million, due primarily to the redemption of our 3.5% Senior Convertible Debentures during 2007.  

 Other Income (Expense)  

 Other income (expense) was $29 million of expense in 2008 versus income of $58 million in 2007. This change reflects a $25 million decrease in income in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $62 million increase in unallocated expenses. The $25 million decline in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment was primarily driven by lower gains on the disposal of several small subsidiaries. The $62 million increase in unallocated expenses was due to $50 million of costs recognized in 2008 associated with acquiring Benfield, along with lower realized gains from the sale of investments.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $879 million, a 14% decrease from $1,023 million in 2007. The decrease was driven by higher restructuring costs, costs associated with acquiring Benfield, and expenses related to FCPA and anti-corruption investigations and compliance initiatives, which more than offset organic revenue growth in both of our segments and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.  

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.5% in 2008 and 34.0% in 2007 primarily due to changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations declined to $637 million ($2.04 diluted net income per share) in 2008 from $675 million ($2.04 diluted net income per share) in 2007. Currency fluctuations positively impacted income from continuing operations in 2008 by $0.16 per diluted share when the 2007 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2008 foreign exchange rates.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 Income from discontinued operations increased to $841 million ($2.76 diluted net income per share) in 2008 from $202 million ($0.62 diluted net income per share) in 2007. The 2008 results include the gain on the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries, the operations of CICA and Sterling for the first quarter of 2008, and the full-year operations of AIS. These gains were partially offset by a loss recognized on sale of our remaining P&C operations. The results in 2007 mainly reflected a full year of operations for CICA, Sterling, AIS and our remaining P&C operations.

 Restructuring Initiatives  

 Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan  

 We announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with our 2008 merger with Benfield. The restructuring plan is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 700 job eliminations. Additionally, duplicate space and assets will be abandoned. We originally estimated that this plan would result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, of which $104 million was recorded as part of the Benfield purchase price allocation and $81 million of which was expected to result in future charges to earnings. During 2009, we reduced the Benfield purchase price allocation by $49 million to reflect actual severance costs being lower than originally estimated. We currently estimate the Plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $155 million, of which $55 million was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation, $55 million has been recorded in earnings and we estimate an additional $45 million will be recorded in future earnings.  

 As of December 31, 2009, approximately 530 jobs have been eliminated under this Plan. Total payments of $67 million have been made under the Aon Benfield Plan to date.  

 All costs associated with the Aon Benfield Plan are included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations into 2011.  

 The restructuring plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver cumulative cost savings of approximately $90 to $100 million in 2010 and $122 million in 2011. We estimate that we realized approximately $45 million of cost savings in 2009. The actual savings, total costs and timing of the restructuring plan may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions of the plan, and foreign exchange rates.  

 The following is a summary of the restructuring and related expenses by type that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Benfield Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause us to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.   

31 

 2007 Restructuring Plan  

 In 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth to better serve clients ("2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan includes an estimated 4,600 job eliminations. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 3,100 positions have been eliminated. We have closed or consolidated several offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. We currently estimate that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately $750 million. Expenses include workforce reduction, lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, as well as other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative. Costs related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect the restructuring and related expenses to affect continuing operations through the first half of 2010. We estimate that we realized approximately $269 million of cost savings in 2009. We anticipate that these initiatives will lead to annualized cost savings, before any potential reinvestment of savings, of approximately $536 million by the end of 2010. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve the targeted savings.  

 The following is a summary of the restructuring and related expenses by type that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the 2007 Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause us to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.   

 Workforce reductions reflect a cash expense, and we may recognize the expense before making payments to the individuals. Asset impairments are non-cash expenses. Lease consolidation accruals reflect the present value of our future cash outflows. Other costs associated with restructuring are cash expenses, which are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  

 Liquidity  

 Executive Summary  

 Our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with financial flexibility to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was highlighted by the repurchase of $590 million of common stock during 2009 and the authorization of a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Aon's liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses, acquisitions, share repurchases, restructuring, funding pension obligations and paying dividends to shareholders.  

 Liquidity is derived from the cash flows from our businesses and from financing activities. Cash on our balance sheets include funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with insurance premiums receivable in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a corresponding offset in Fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for Aon.  

 We use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including net cash provided by operations, free cash flow, net debt-to-capital and return on capital. We believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.  

 Summary Cash Flow table  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

33 

 Operating Activities  

 Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased $584 million compared with 2008, due primarily to the change in client-held funds. Excluding the change in client-held funds, cash provided from operating activities increased $31 million compared to 2008. The primary contributors to cash flow from operations, excluding the change in client-held funds, in 2009 were net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1.3 billion and $67 million of restructuring expense in excess of cash payments, partially offset by $404 million of cash contributions to our major defined pension plans in excess of pension expense, net of curtailment gains, a $105 million decrease in current income taxes, a $63 million increase in receivables, a $54 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $266 million decrease in other assets and liabilities. The large pension cash contributions are primarily driven by new funding agreements for our U.K. pension plans completed during the year. Pension contributions for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $437 million. In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $381 million to our pension plans. Payments made for our various restructuring programs amounted to $327 million during 2009, and are expected to be $290 million in 2010.  

 We expect cash generated by operations for 2010 to be sufficient to service debt and contractual obligations, fund cash requirements of our restructuring programs, finance capital expenditures, continue acquisition of shares under our share repurchase program, and continue paying dividends to our shareholders. Although 2010 cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations, we have the ability to borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate timing differences in cash flows. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $1.3 billion that are currently undrawn and that can be accessed on a same-day basis. Additionally, we believe we could access capital markets for debt financing for longer-term funding, under current market conditions, if needed.  

 Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 decreased $304 million compared with 2007. Excluding the change in client-held funds, cash provided from operating activities decreased $779 million compared to 2007, primarily attributable to a $765 million decrease in net income (adjusted for non-cash items), reflecting $376 million of taxes paid on the gain from the sales of CICA and Sterling, as well as $330 million less cash flow from the operations of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, which were sold on April 1, 2008.  

 Investing Activities  

 Cash used for investing activities was $139 million in 2009, primarily comprised of $274 million paid to acquire 14 businesses, including Allied North America and FCC Global Insurance Services, $158 million paid to purchase long-term investments, and $140 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $332 million of net proceeds from the sales of short- and long-term investments.  

 Cash provided by investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2008. During 2008, we received $2.8 billion in proceeds from the sale of CICA and Sterling, partially offset by $1.1 billion paid for Benfield and other acquisitions.  

 Cash used for investing activities was $463 million in 2007, principally $251 million paid to acquire businesses and $170 million for capital expenditures.  

 Financing Activities  

 Cash used for financing activities in 2009 was $617 million. The net impact of treasury stock transactions reflects the purchase of $590 million of treasury shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan. During 2009, we received $684 million from the issuance of long-term debt, primarily €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures. These funds were primarily used to pay down our borrowings under our Euro credit  

34 

facility. We also used $100 million for the repayment of short-term debt related to a variable interest entity ("VIE") for which we were the primary beneficiary. Cash dividends of $165 million were paid to shareholders.  

 Cash used for financing activities in 2008 was $2.2 billion. This was primarily comprised of $1.9 billion of share repurchase activity, less the proceeds from the exercise of stock options; the net repayment of debt of $386 million, almost entirely related to our Euro credit facility; and dividends of $171 million.  

 Cash used for financing activities in 2007 was $553 million. This reflects $714 million of net repayments of debt, partially offset by $806 million of new debt issuances. Share repurchase activity used $751 million and dividend payments of $176 million were paid to shareholders.  

 Cash and Investments  

 At December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $639 million, a decrease of $627 million from December 31, 2008. Of the total balance recorded at December 31, 2009, approximately $85 million was restricted as to use. At December 31, 2009, $199 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and $440 million was held by our subsidiaries in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have an unfavorable tax impact.  

 In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly, depending on when we collect the premiums, claims and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are required to be invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of $3.3 billion and fiduciary receivables of $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments are not owned by us, and cannot be used for general corporate purposes.  

 As disclosed in Note 17, "Fair Value and Financial Instruments," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. Money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Based on market convention, we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We do not believe that there are any market liquidity issues affecting the fair value of these investments.  

 As of December 31, 2009, our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of $2.1 billion and are reported as cash equivalents, short-term investments or fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature and initial maturity.  

35 

 The following table summarizes our fiduciary assets and non-fiduciary cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Share Repurchase Program  

 Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to $4.6 billion of our outstanding common stock. Shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. Any repurchased shares will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2009, we repurchased 15.1 million shares at a cost of $590 million. In 2008, we repurchased 42.6 million shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. In 2007, we repurchased 19.1 million shares at a cost of $751 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2005, we have repurchased a total of 105.8 million shares for an aggregate cost of $4.3 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we were authorized to purchase up to $265 million of additional shares under the current share repurchase program. The timing and amount of future purchases will be based on market and other conditions.  

 In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which up to $2 billion of common stock may be repurchased from time to time depending on market conditions or other factors through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will commence under the new share repurchase program upon conclusion of the existing program.  

 For information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2009, see Item 5  "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" above.  

 Shelf Registration Statement  

 On June 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt, preferred stock, common stock and convertible securities. We have not issued any securities under this registration statement. The availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. There can be no assurance regarding when, or if, we will issue any securities thereunder.  

 Credit Facilities  

 In December 2009, we cancelled our $600 million U.S. bank credit facility, which was due to expire in February 2010, and replaced it with a $400 million, three-year unsecured revolving credit facility. Sixteen banks are participating in the facility, which is for general corporate purposes, including a commercial paper backstop. Additionally, at December 31, 2009, we have a five-year €650 million  

36 

($937 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) multi-currency foreign credit facility available. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under either facility.  

 For both our U.S. and Euro facilities, we are required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2009.  

 Rating Agency Ratings  

 The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 24, 2010 appear in the table below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 There were no changes in our ratings or outlook during 2009.  

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether. Although we have committed backup lines, we cannot ensure that our financial position will not be adversely impacted if we were unable to access the commercial paper market.  

 Letters of Credit  

 We have outstanding letters of credit ("LOCs") totaling approximately $153 million at December 31, 2009. These letters of credit are for the benefit of Virginia Surety Company ("VSC") related to a non-performance risk of reinsurers of VSC's worker's compensation business in California, a LOC that secures deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program, and LOCs to cover the beneficiaries related to our Canadian pension plan scheme, secure one of our U.S. pension plans, and to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties.  

 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources  

 We believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditures and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1, "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors."  

37 

 Contractual Obligations  

 Summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. 

(2)In 2007, our principal U.K subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £9.4 million ($15 million) per year to that pension plan for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by approximately 5% on each April 1. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated winding-up deficit was £420 million ($671 million). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid. 

(3)Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including what is to be purchased, at what price and the approximate timing of the transaction. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or for claims outsourcing in the U.K. 

(4)As of December 31, 2009, we can exit an information technology contract for termination payments of $13 million. However, given the nature of this contract, we have included it in our contractual obligations table. 

(5)Also included is a $318 million contract for claims outsourcing in the U.K. We can exit this obligation after 2013 for approximately $32 million. 

(6)Excludes a $42 million commitment to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities from PEPS I, as the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. 

(7)Excludes $61 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements will be made.   

38 

 Financial Condition  

 At December 31, 2009, net assets of $5.4 billion, representing total assets minus total liabilities, were essentially equivalent to the balance at December 31, 2008. Working capital decreased $374 million to $1.3 billion.  

 Balance sheet categories that reflected large variances from last year included the following:    

Cash and short-term investments declined $627 million, resulting primarily from cash used for our ongoing share repurchase program, funding of our various pension plans, and the acquisition of subsidiaries.   

Goodwill increased $441 million, due principally to the impact of foreign currency translation and the acquisitions of several businesses during 2009.   

Short-term debt decreased $95 million, due principally to the repayment of $100 million in debt held at one of our formerly consolidated VIEs.   

Long-term debt increased by $126 million, principally reflecting the issuance of €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures due on July 1, 2014. Most of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay $677 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Euro credit facility.   

Pension and other post employment liabilities increased $195 million, due to lower discount rates used by the plans, actuarial losses, adverse pension asset performance and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased contributions made to the plans.   

 Borrowings  

 Total debt at December 31, 2009 was $2.0 billion, an increase of $31 million from December 31, 2008. On July 1, 2009, one of our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries issued €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures due on July 1, 2014. The principal and interest on the debentures is unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by us. Most of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $677 million outstanding under our Euro credit facility. During 2009, we repaid $100 million of short-term debt held at one of our VIEs that was fully liquidated in 2009, and also redeemed and cancelled a portion of our 8.205% Debentures. Our total debt as a percentage of total capital attributable to Aon shareholders was 27.2% and 27.1% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

39 

           In 1997, we created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust ("Trust"), for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities ("Capital Securities"). We received cash and 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the "Debentures") to Aon Capital A. These transactions were structured such that the net cash flows from Aon to Aon Capital A matched the cash flows from Aon Capital A to the third party investors. We determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and, thus reflected the Debentures as long-term debt. During the first half of 2009, we repurchased $15 million face value of the Capital Securities for approximately $10 million, resulting in a $5 million gain, which is reported in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. To facilitate the legal release of the obligation created through the Debentures associated with this repurchase and future repurchases, we dissolved the Trust effective June 25, 2009. This dissolution resulted in the exchange of the Capital Securities held by third parties for the Debentures. Also in connection with the dissolution of the Trust, the $24 million of common equity of Aon Capital A held by us was exchanged for $24 million of Debentures, which were then cancelled. Following these actions, $687 million of Debentures remain outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The Debentures are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027 or are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at our option upon the occurrence of certain events.  

 Equity  

 Equity at December 31, 2009 was $5.4 billion, an increase of $16 million from December 31, 2008. Net income of $792 million and stock compensation expense of $209 million in 2009 were almost completely offset by share repurchases of $590 million, a $213 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and $165 million of dividends to shareholders.  

 Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $213 million since December 31, 2008, reflecting the following:    

an increase in the net post-retirement benefit obligation of $413 million, as a result of lower discount rates, actuarial losses and adverse pension asset performance,   

an improvement in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $199 million, which was attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,   

net unrealized investment losses of $12 million, and   

net derivative gains of $13 million.   

 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

 Premium Financing Operations  

 In 2008, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the U.S. operations of Cananwill, our premium finance business. This disposition was completed in February 2009. In connection with this sale, we have guaranteed the collection of the principal amount of the premium finance notes sold to the buyer, which, at December 31, 2009, was $8 million. Historical losses in this business have been very low since the premium finance notes are generally fully collateralized by the lender's right, in the event of non-payment, to cancel the underlying insurance contract and collect the unearned premium from the insurance carrier. We do not expect to incur a significant loss related to this guarantee.  

 Some of our U.K., Canadian, and Australian subsidiaries originated short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance their insurance premium obligations, and then sold these premium finance agreements to unaffiliated companies in whole loan sales. Prior to August 2009, these loans were sold in securitization transactions that met the criteria for sale accounting. In June and July of 2009, we entered into agreements with third parties with respect to our international premium finance businesses (collectively, the "Cananwill International Agreements"). As a result of the Cananwill International Agreements, the third parties began originating, financing and servicing  

40 

premium finance loans generated by referrals from our brokerage operations. The third parties did not acquire our existing portfolio of premium finance loans, and as such, we did not extend any guarantees under these agreements.  

 Further details are included in Note 5 "Business Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  

 At December 31, 2008 and continuing through December 18, 2009, we consolidated the following VIEs:    

Juniperus Insurance Opportunity Fund Limited ("Juniperus"), which is an investment vehicle that invests in an actively managed and diversified portfolio of insurance risks, and   

Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited ("JCHL"), which provides investment management and related services to Juniperus.   

 Prior to December 18, 2009, based on our percentage equity interest in the Juniperus Class A shares, we bore a majority of the expected residual return and losses. Similarly, our voting and economic interest percentage in JCHL required us to absorb a majority of JCHL's expected residual returns and losses. We were considered the primary beneficiary of both companies, and as such these entities were consolidated. As of December 18, 2009, our equity interest in Juniperus declined to 38%, and we held a 39% voting and economic interest in JCHL. Based on our holdings, we no longer are considered the primary beneficiary of either entity and have therefore deconsolidated both entities. Prospectively, their results will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  

 Juniperus and JCHL had combined assets and liabilities of $121 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $36 million of pretax income from Juniperus and JCHL. We recognized $16 million of after-tax income, after allocating the appropriate share of net income to the noncontrolling interests. Our potential loss at December 31, 2009 is limited to our investment in the VIEs, which is $73 million.  

 We previously owned the majority economic equity interest in Globe Re Limited ("Globe Re"), a VIE, which provided reinsurance coverage for a defined portfolio of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts underwritten by a third party for a limited period which ended June 1, 2009. We consolidated Globe Re as we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. In connection with the winding up of its operations, Globe Re repaid its $100 million of short-term debt and our equity investment from available cash in 2009. We recognized $2 million of pretax income from Globe Re in 2009. Globe Re was fully liquidated in the third quarter of 2009.  

 REVIEW BY SEGMENT  

 General  

 We serve clients through the following segments:    

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services  we act as an advisor and insurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, as well as negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.   

Consulting  we provide advice and services to clients related to health and benefits, retirement, compensation, strategic human capital, and human resource outsourcing.

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 During 2009 we continued to see a soft market, which began in 2007, in our retail brokerage product line. In 2007, we experienced a soft market in many business lines and in many geographic areas. In a "soft market," premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. Prices fell throughout 2007, with the greatest declines seen in large and middle-market accounts. Prices continued to decline during 2008, although the rate of decline slowed toward the end of the year. In our reinsurance brokerage product line, pricing overall during 2009 was also down, although during a portion of the year it was flat to up slightly.  

 Additionally, beginning in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets have reduced our customers' demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products, which have negatively hurt our operational results. In addition, overall capacity in the industry could decrease if a significant insurer either fails or withdraws from writing insurance coverages that we offer our clients. This failure could reduce our revenues and profitability, since we would no longer have access to certain lines and types of insurance.  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 83% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients' policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.  

 We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcare providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide investment banking products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.  

 In November 2008 we expanded our product offerings through the merger with Benfield, a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. Benfield products have been integrated with our existing reinsurance products in 2009.  

 In February 2009, we completed the sale of the U.S. operations of Cananwill, our premium finance business. In June and July of 2009, we entered into agreements with third parties with respect to our  

42 

international premium finance businesses, whereby these third parties began originating, financing, and servicing premium finance loans generated by referrals from our brokerage operations.  

 Revenue  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services commissions, fees and other revenue was as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In 2009, commissions, fees and other revenue increased $203 million or 3% from 2008 driven primarily by the Benfield merger, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a decline in organic revenue of 1%.  

 Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other revenue growth for 2009 versus 2008 is as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The 1% decline in Americas reflects unfavorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset a 1% increase in organic revenue, driven by strong growth in Latin America and growth in our U.S. Retail operations despite overall economic weakness, partially offset by declines in our Canadian operation.  

 United Kingdom commissions, fees and other revenue declined 12% driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 6% organic revenue decline, reflecting weak market conditions as well as lower retentions and new business.  

 Europe, Middle East & Africa commissions, fees and other revenue decreased 8% driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The 1% organic decline was principally due to weakness in France, Germany and Ireland, partially offset by growth in the emerging markets of the Middle East and Africa.  

 Asia Pacific commissions, fees and other revenue decreased 7%, due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decline in organic growth driven largely by the negative impact  

43 

of exiting a business in Japan, economic weakness in Asia and political unrest in Thailand, partially offset by growth in New Zealand and certain emerging markets.  

 Reinsurance commissions, fees and other revenue increased 48%, due mainly to the Benfield merger, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic revenue is even with 2008, as growth in domestic treaty business and slightly higher pricing was offset by greater client retention, and declines in investment banking and facultative placements.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased $54 million or 6% from 2008 to $900 million in 2009. In 2009, operating income margins in this segment were 14.3%, up 60 basis points from 13.7% in 2008. Contributing to increased operating income and margins were the merger with Benfield, lower E&O costs due to insurance recoveries, a pension curtailment gain of $54 million in 2009 versus a curtailment loss of $6 million in 2008, declines in anti-corruption and compliance initiative costs of $35 million, restructuring savings, and other cost savings initiatives.  

 These items were partially offset by an increase of $140 million in restructuring costs, $95 million of lower fiduciary investment income, Benfield integration costs and higher amortization of intangible assets obtained in the merger, and unfavorable foreign currency translation.  

 Consulting  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Our Consulting segment generated 17% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009 and provides a broad range of human capital consulting services, as follows:  

 Consulting Services:    

1.Health and Benefits advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs that attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting include health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence management, benefits administration, data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory and elective benefits services. 

2.Retirement specializes in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration. 

3.Compensation focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries. 

4.Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change management.   

 Outsourcing offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment-related services.  

 Beginning in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets has created significant uncertainty in the marketplace. The prolonged economic downturn is adversely impacting our clients' financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. While we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time, these challenges are reducing demand for some of our services and depressing the price of those services, which is having an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.  

44 

           Revenue  

 In 2009, commissions, fees and other revenue of $1.3 billion was 6% lower than 2008. Consulting commissions, fees and other revenue was as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Organic revenue declined 2% in 2009, as detailed in the following reconciliation of organic revenue growth:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consulting services decreased $64 million or 6%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange as well as declines in most major practice groups. International operations organic revenue was similar to last year.  

 Outsourcing revenue declined $23 million, or 11%, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and the previously announced termination of our contract with AT&T, partially offset by modest growth in Canada.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income was $203 million, a decrease of $5 million, or 2%, from 2008. This decrease was principally driven by a 2% organic revenue decline, higher restructuring costs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. These declines were partially offset by savings related to the 2007 restructuring plan, a $20 million gain from the pension curtailment, lower incentive compensation costs, and other cost saving initiatives. Operating income margins in this segment for 2009 were 16.0%, an increase of 70 basis points from 15.3% in 2008, as the impact of the revenue shortfall was more than offset by a reduction in expenses.  

 Unallocated Income and Expense  

 A reconciliation of our segment income from continuing operations before income taxes to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

45 

 Unallocated revenue consists of revenue from our equity ownership in insurance investments, Juniperus and JCHL, obtained in the Benfield merger. No revenue from these investments was recognized in 2008.  

 Unallocated expenses include corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments and the costs associated with our ownership of insurance investments. These expenses decreased by $38 million in 2009 from $165 million in 2008, driven by $50 million of costs incurred in 2008 related to the merger with Benfield, partially offset by additional expenses of $13 million incurred in 2009 associated with our ownership in Juniperus and JCHL.  

 In 2009, we recognized $36 million of pretax income from Juniperus and JCHL. We recognized $16 million of after-tax income, after allocating the appropriate share of net income to the noncontrolling interests.  

 Interest income consists primarily of income earned on our operating cash balances and miscellaneous income producing securities. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $30 million in 2009, a decrease of $64 million from 2008, which was driven primarily by lower investment balances, the global decline in interest rates and a $26 million decrease in income from our PEPS I investment. In 2008, we had a large investment balance for part of the year due to cash received as a result of the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries.  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, declined $4 million due primarily to the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates, which was mostly offset by higher interest rates following the third quarter issuance of €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of long-term debt at an interest rate of 6.25%, which replaced debt borrowed under our Euro credit facility.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  

 In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements.  

 Restructuring  

 Workforce reduction costs  

 The method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are one-time costs. We account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula.  

 We estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being  

46 

terminated. We recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.  

 Lease consolidation costs  

 Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes.  

 Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses  

 Accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value.  

 Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. However, we may discount the severance arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. Accretion of the discount occurs over the remaining life of the liability.  

 For the remaining lease term or severance payout, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.  

 Other associated costs of exit and disposal activities  

 We recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.  

 Asset impairments may result from large-scale restructurings and we account for these impairments in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life.  

 Aon Benfield purchase accounting  

 We established a restructuring plan related to our acquisition of Benfield ("Aon Benfield Plan"), which includes reductions in staffing levels and the abandonment of excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring activities and as part of the cost of the acquisition, we established liabilities, primarily for severance and excess facilities. We finalized our restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2009 and adjusted liabilities where necessary, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill.  

 Pensions  

 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada.  

47 

 Significant changes to pension plans  

 Our U.S., U.K. and Canadian pension plans were previously closed to new entrants. Effective January 1, 2009, our Netherlands plan was also closed to new entrants. In 2007, future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in our U.K. plans. Effective April 1, 2009, we ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our two U.S. plans. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain of $83 million in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, we will cease crediting future benefits relating to service in our Canadian pension plans. We recognized a curtailment loss of $5 million related to the Canadian pension plans in 2009.  

 Recognition of gains and losses and prior service  

 We defer the recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and asset performance.  

 Unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the Netherlands and Canada, or the average life expectancy of the U.S. and U.K. plan members. After the effective date of the plan amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service, unrecognized gains and losses will also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the Canadian plans. We amortize any prior service costs or credits which arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.  

 As of December 31, 2009, the pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation ("PBO"). To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.  

 The following table discloses our combined experience loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2010 amortization of loss by country (amounts in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 There was no unrecognized prior service cost at December 31, 2009.  

 The U.S. pension plans use the market-related value of assets to determine expected return on assets. As of December 31, 2009, we reported a fair value of pension assets of $1,153 million, compared with a market-related value of $1,384 million. The market-related value of pension assets does not yet reflect accumulated asset losses of $231 million. These losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the market-related asset value and amortized into expense. Prior to being fully recognized, they may be offset by future asset gains. We reflect 20% of the current year's asset gain or loss in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years.  

 Our plans in the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada use fair value to determine expected return on assets.

 Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation  

 The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Includes investments in infrastructure, real estate, limited partnerships and hedge funds.   

 In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.  

 The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The actual asset allocation at December 31, 2009 was 60% equity and 40% fixed income securities for the qualified plan.  

 The investment policy for each U.K. pension plan is generally determined by the plans' trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation represents a weighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change. In total, as of December 31, 2009, the U.K. plans were invested 51% in equity and 49% in fixed income securities.  

 As of December 31, 2009, the Netherlands' plan was invested 40% in equity and 60% in fixed income securities, and in total the Canadian plans were invested 71% in equity and 29% in fixed income securities.  

 Impact of changing economic assumptions  

 Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.  

 Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated 2010 pension expense (in millions):

 Estimated future contributions  

 We estimate contributions of approximately $381 million in 2010 as compared with $437 million in 2009.  

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either trademarks, client lists, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles. Our goodwill and other intangible balances at December 31, 2009 were $6.1 billion and $791 million, respectively, compared to $5.6 billion and $779 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.  

 Although goodwill is not amortized, we test it for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. Beginning in 2009, we also test trademarks (which also are not amortized) that were acquired in conjunction with the Benfield merger for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2009 or 2008 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or trademarks.  

 We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.  

 The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of  

50 

the reporting unit's goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.  

 In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2009 and 2008, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.  

 We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.  

 Contingencies  

 We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlement strategy. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.  

 Share-based Payments  

 Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest during that period. Thus, we have reduced expense for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. When the terms of an award require no additional service, the award is fully expensed at the grant date. When awards are modified, we account for the incremental shares at the fair market value at the date of modification. Expense recognition begins on the date the service period begins, which can precede or be after the grant date, depending on the provisions of the award.  

 Option accounting  

 We use a lattice-binomial option-pricing model to value stock options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options, and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on our stock.  

51 

 In terms of the assumptions used in the lattice-based model, we:    

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model. In 2008 and prior years, we stratified between executives and key employees. Beginning in 2009, after reviewing additional historical data, we changed the valuation model to stratify employees between those receiving Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP") options, Special Stock Plan options, and all other option grants. We believe that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns.   

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate, and   

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   

 The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.  

 Restricted stock unit awards  

 Employees may either receive service-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") or performance-based awards, which ultimately result in the receipt of RSUs, if the employee achieves his or her objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We account for service-based awards by expensing the total award value over the service period. We calculate the total award value by multiplying the estimated total number of shares to be delivered by the fair value on the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures based on our actual historical experience and consider dividend discounts when determining the fair value of the RSUs. Performance-based RSUs may be immediately vested upon the end of the performance period or may have a future additional service period. Generally, our performance awards are fixed, which means we determine the fair value of the award at the grant date, estimate the number of shares to be delivered at the end of the performance period, and recognize the expense over the performance or vesting period, whichever is longer. These estimates take into account performance to date as well as an assessment of future performance. These assessments are made by management using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the expense recognized.  

 The largest performance-based stock plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. The 2007 to 2009 performance period ended on December 31, 2009. The LPP currently has two ongoing performance periods: 2008 to 2010 and 2009 to 2011. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both the 2008-2010 and 2009-2011 plans would have increased our 2009 expense by approximately $4 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $4 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as well as U.S. federal and state tax laws. The estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item. We consider the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items.  

 The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management's assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.  

52 

 We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a "more likely than not" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations to the extent they are considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according to the Internal Revenue Code, and could materially affect our future effective tax rate.  

 We base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those which deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.  

 We operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:    

the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue,   

to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities,   

we may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed, and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance, and   

tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes.
