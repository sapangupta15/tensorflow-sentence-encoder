 In general, most of the Companys markets are highly competitive. The principal elements of competition for the Companys products are price, product technology, distribution, quality, and service.  

 In the markets served by EIG, the Company believes that it ranks among the leading U.S. producers of certain measuring and control instruments. It also is a leader in the U.S. heavy-vehicle instrumentation and power instrument markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers to the commercial aviation market. Competition remains strong and can intensify for certain EIG products, especially its pressure gauge and heavy-vehicle instrumentation products. Both of these businesses have several strong competitors. In the process and analytical instruments market, numerous companies in each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary depending on the specific market niche.  

 EMGs differentiated businesses have competition from a limited number of companies in each of their markets. Competition is generally based on product innovation, performance and price. There also is competition from alternative materials and processes. In its cost-driven businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition in the U.S. floor care market from independent manufacturers. Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that serve both the U.S. and the European floor care markets. Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to Asia where AMETEK has a smaller but growing market position. There is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also be potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor production.
