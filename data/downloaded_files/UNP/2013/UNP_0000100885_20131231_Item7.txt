Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this Item 7.  

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

2013 Results  

       Safety  During 2013, we continued focusing on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, our customers and the public. Our sustained efforts to improve crossing warning systems and, where possible, close at-grade crossings reduced grade crossing incidents per million train miles by 7% during the year. We closed 212 grade crossings in 2013 to reduce our exposure to incidents and continued using video cameras on our locomotives to analyze safety incidents. Although reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee hours increased 4% from last years record low, it is our second lowest year and a 9% decline from 2011. Our reportable derailment incidents per million train miles increased slightly, less than 1%, from 2012. These results demonstrate our continued development and expansion of our safety programs and initiatives, including Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture, and Standard Work.  

       Financial Performance  In 2013, we generated operating income of $7.4 billion, a 10% increase over 2012. Core pricing gains of 3.6% along with our ongoing focus on safety, service, network efficiency and productivity drove record financial results for the year. Our operating ratio for 2013 of 66.1% was an all-time best, improving from last years operating ratio of 67.8%. Net income of $4.4 billion surpassed our previous milestone set in 2012, translating into earnings of $9.42 per diluted share for 2013.  

       Freight Revenues  Our freight revenues grew 5% year-over-year to $20.7 billion. Freight revenues for five of the six commodity groups increased despite flat volume. Volume growth in shale-related products (crude oil and frac sand), automotive and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal, international intermodal and agricultural products. Core pricing gains, an automotive logistics management arrangement and shifts in business mix all resulted in higher average revenue per car (ARC), which drove the growth in freight revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Our fuel surcharge was essentially flat versus 2012, as lower fuel price offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs (surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months).  

       Network Operations  In 2013, despite challenging weather and significant shifts in our business mix, our operations remained efficient and fluid. As reported to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), average train speed declined 2% in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting severe weather conditions and shifts of traffic to sections of our network with higher utilization. Average terminal dwell time increased 3% primarily due to continuing growth of manifest traffic, which requires more time in terminals for switching cars and building trains.  

       Fuel Prices  In 2013, the average price per barrel of crude oil increased from 2012. However, the average price per gallon of diesel fuel that we paid in 2013 decreased 2% from the average price in 2012, as lower crude oil to diesel conversion spreads in 2013 more than offset the higher price for crude oil. The lower price decreased operating expenses by $75 million (excluding any impact from year-over-year volume). A 1% decline in gross-ton miles also drove lower fuel expense. Our fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles, increased 2% compared to 2012 partially offsetting the decreases. Declines in heavier, more fuel-efficient coal shipments drove the gross-ton-mile and fuel consumption rate variances.  

       Free Cash Flow  Cash generated by operating activities totaled $6.8 billion, yielding record free cash flow of $2.1 billion after reductions of $3.4 billion for cash used in investing activities and a 16%  

23

     increase in dividends paid. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid.  

Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2014 Outlook  

       Safety  Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement, and targeted capital investments. We will continue using and expanding the deployment of Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care throughout our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. Derailment prevention and the reduction of grade crossing incidents are also critical aspects of our safety programs. We will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), various industry programs and local community activities across our network.  

       Network Operations  We believe the Railroad is capable of handling growing volumes while providing high levels of customer service. Our track structure is in excellent condition, and certain sections of our network have surplus line and terminal capacity. We are in a solid resource position, with sufficient supplies of locomotives, freight cars and crews to support growth.  

       Fuel Prices  Uncertainty about the economy makes projections of fuel prices difficult. We again could see volatile fuel prices during the year, as they are sensitive to global and U.S. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions and other factors. To reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings, we will continue seeking cost recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expanding our fuel conservation efforts.  

       Capital Plan  In 2014, we plan to make total capital investments of approximately $3.9 billion, including expenditures for Positive Train Control (PTC), which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. (See further discussion in this Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources  Capital Plan.)  

       Positive Train Control  In response to a legislative mandate to implement PTC by the end of 2015, we have invested $1.2 billion in capital expenditures and plan to spend an additional $450 million during 2014 on developing and deploying PTC. We currently estimate that PTC, in accordance with implementing rules issued by the Federal Rail Administration (FRA), will cost us approximately $2 billion by the end of the project. This includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks, upgrading locomotives to work with the new system, and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the various components of the system and achieve interoperability for the industry. Although it is unlikely that the rail industry will meet the current mandatory 2015 deadline (as the FRA indicated in its 2012 report to Congress), we are making a good faith effort to do so and we are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology.

Table of Contents 

       Financial Expectations  We are cautious about the economic environment, but, assuming that industrial production grows approximately 3% as projected, volume should exceed 2013 levels. Even with no volume growth, we expect earnings to exceed 2013 earnings, generated by core pricing gains, on-going network improvements and productivity initiatives. We expect that free cash flow for 2014 will be lower than 2013 as higher cash from operations will be more than offset by additional cash of approximately $400 million that will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred through bonus depreciation, increased capital spend and higher dividend payments.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and ARC. Changes in price, traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive ARC. We provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations, which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments. We recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination. We allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them.  

Other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenues, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage. We recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations.  

Freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups increased during 2013 compared to 2012. Revenue from agricultural products was down slightly compared to 2012. ARC increased 5%, driven by core pricing gains, shifts in business mix and an automotive logistics management arrangement. Volume was essentially flat year over year as growth in automotives, frac sand, crude oil and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal, international intermodal and grain shipments.  

Freight revenues from four of our six commodity groups increased during 2012 compared to 2011. Revenues from coal and agricultural products declined during the year. Our franchise diversity allowed us to take advantage of growth from shale-related markets (crude oil, frac sand and pipe) and strong automotive manufacturing, which offset volume declines from coal and agricultural products. ARC increased 7%, driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel cost recoveries. Improved fuel recovery provisions and higher fuel prices, including the lag effect of our programs (surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months), combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges.  

Our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.2 billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Fuel surcharge in 2013 was essentially flat versus 2012 as lower fuel price offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs (surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months). Rising fuel prices and more shipments subject to fuel surcharges drove the increase from 2011 to 2012.  

In 2013, other revenue increased from 2012 due primarily to miscellaneous contract revenue and higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services.  

In 2012, other revenues increased from 2011 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services. Assessorial revenues also increased in 2012 due to container revenue related to an increase in intermodal shipments.

Table of Contents 

The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and ARC by commodity type:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [a]  Each intermodal container or trailer equals one carload.  

Agricultural Products  Lower volume offset price improvements as freight revenue declined slightly versus 2012. In the fourth quarter grain shipments increased 41% due to a robust fall harvest. Despite the fourth quarter growth, grain shipments still decreased 4% for the full year when compared to 2012, reflecting the impact of the severe drought in 2012 that affected territory served by us during the first three quarters of 2013. Export wheat shipped to the Gulf and Pacific Northwest increased in the second half of 2013, partially offsetting the declines in grain. 

Lower volume more than offset pricing gains    

2013 Agricultural Carloads 

and increased fuel surcharges as agricultural freight revenue decreased in 2012 versus 2011. Weak export demand for U.S. wheat drove a 19% decrease in wheat shipments year over year, as the foreign wheat market improved significantly from the weather affected crop in 2011. In addition, corn shipments declined 11% for the year, with more significant declines in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of the severe drought across the U.S. Lower gasoline demand, reduced exports and higher corn prices decreased ethanol shipments during the second half of the year. Growth in imported beer from Mexico and a strong domestic harvest of fresh potatoes partially offset these declines.  

26  

Table of Contents 

Automotive  Higher ARC due to price increases and the logistics management arrangement that covers fees and container costs, coupled with increased shipments of automotive parts and finished vehicles, improved automotive revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Higher production and sales levels during 2013 drove the volume growth. 

In 2012, stronger shipments of finished vehicles and automotive parts along with pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges improved automotive freight revenue from 2011 levels. Higher production and sales levels drove the volume growth. In addition, 2012 shipments compared favorably to 2011 due to lower shipments of international vehicles in 2011 following the disaster in Japan.    

2013 Automotive Carloads 

Chemicals  Volume gains and price improvement increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2013 versus 2012. Shipments of crude oil from the Bakken, Permian, Niobrara and Eagle Ford shale formations primarily to the Gulf area drove the growth in shipments of chemicals. In addition, shipments of industrial chemicals increased as manufacturing, housing and automotive markets improved. 

Higher volume, price improvements and fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2012. Shipments of crude oil primarily from the Bakken, Permian and Eagle Ford Shale formations to the Gulf area increased over three fold, driving the    

2013 Chemicals Carloads 

improvement in chemicals shipments. In addition, plastics and industrial chemicals shipments increased as low natural gas prices have made U.S. chemicals more cost competitive globally. Declines in potash due to temporary shutdowns and reduced production at several mines partially offset the increases in chemical shipments during the year.  

  Coal  ARC gains driven by price increases and positive business mix partially offset by volume declines increased freight revenue from coal shipments in 2013 versus 2012. Southern Powder River Basin (SPRB) shipments declined 10% from 2012 due to the loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year, relatively mild summer weather, and tighter coal inventory management by utilities. Shipments from Colorado and Utah mines decreased 13% compared to 2012, driven by soft domestic demand and mine production issues, partially offset by second half growth in international shipments. Severe flooding and washouts in Colorado also reduced volumes from certain producers in the third quarter.    

2013 Coal Carloads 

Lower volume, partially offset by pricing gains and fuel surcharge recoveries reduced freight revenue from coal shipments in 2012 compared to 2011. Shipments of coal from the Southern Powder River Basin (SPRB) mines decreased 15% from 2011. Above average coal stockpiles due to an unseasonably warm winter and low natural gas prices, which caused some displacement of coal in electricity production, led to  

27  

Table of Contents 

 the volume declines. In addition, the loss of two contracts to a competitor contributed to lower volumes from the SPRB. Coal shipments from the Colorado and Utah mines increased 2% versus 2011. Increased export shipments of Colorado and Utah coal in 2012 offset the domestic declines due to higher stockpiles and low natural gas prices.  

Industrial Products  Freight revenue from industrial products increased in 2013 versus 2012 driven by volume growth and higher ARC due to pricing gains and favorable business mix. Shipments of non-metallic minerals (primarily frac sand) grew as a result of drilling activity for energy products. Additionally, growth in new housing construction and home improvements drove an increase in lumber shipments. Declines in ferrous scrap and government shipments partially offset these higher volumes. 

Pricing improvement, higher volume and additional fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from industrial products in 2012 versus    

2013 Industrial Products Carloads 

2011. Shipments of non-metallic minerals (primarily frac sand), grew in response to increased horizontal drilling activity for energy products. More construction activity during a relatively mild winter led to higher demand for shipments of lumber, cement and stone compared to 2011. The growth in housing starts throughout 2012 also increased lumber shipments, up 12% from 2011. Steel shipments finished slightly down from 2011 levels as lower demand for export scrap and mine production issues in the second half of the year offset increases in the first half due to higher demand for steel coils and plate for pipe and auto production.  

Intermodal  Pricing improvements and slight volume growth drove increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2013 compared to 2012. Domestic traffic increased 3% due to conversions from truck transportation to rail. International traffic declined 2% versus 2012, reflecting market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and an increase in transloading in the second half of the year. Transloading involves the transfer of goods from international to domestic containers at distribution centers near West coast ports, which reduces demand for rail transportation to these centers. 

Higher fuel surcharges, including improved fuel    

2013 Intermodal Carloads 

recovery provisions, core pricing gains and volume growth increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2012. Volume levels from international traffic remained flat year-over-year as the loss of a customer contract in the first half of the year offset modest West Coast import growth. Domestic traffic increased 3% versus 2011 due to better market conditions and continued conversion of traffic from truck to rail.  

Mexico Business  Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business increased 9% to $2.1 billion in 2013 versus 2012. Shipments were up 3% versus 2012, all commodity groups grew with the exception of agricultural products. The largest growth came from automotive and industrial products shipments.  

Revenue from Mexico business increased 8% to $1.9 billion in 2012 versus 2011. Volume levels for four of the six commodity groups (industrial products and agricultural products declined), were up 5% in aggregate versus 2011, with particularly strong growth in automotive and intermodal shipments.

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating expenses increased $336 million in 2013 versus 2012. Wage and benefit inflation, new logistics management fees and container costs for our automotive business, locomotive overhauls, property taxes and repairs on jointly owned property contributed to higher expenses during the year. Lower fuel prices partially offset the cost increases. 

Operating expenses increased $348 million in 2012 versus 2011. Depreciation, wage and benefit inflation, higher fuel prices and volume-related trucking services purchased by our logistics subsidiaries, contributed to higher expenses during the year. Efficiency gains,    

2013 Operating Expenses 

volume related fuel savings (2% fewer gallons of fuel consumed) and $38 million of weather related expenses in 2011, which favorably affects the comparison, partially offset the cost increase.  

Compensation and Benefits  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, other postretirement benefits, and incentive costs. General wages and benefits inflation, higher work force levels and increased pension and other postretirement benefits drove the increases in 2013 versus 2012. The impact of ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset these increases.  

Expenses in 2012 were essentially flat versus 2011 as operational improvements and cost reductions offset general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, weather related costs increased these expenses in 2011.  

Fuel  Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Lower locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $3.15 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2013, compared to $3.22 in 2012, decreased expenses by $75 million. Volume, as measured by gross ton-miles, decreased 1% while the fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles, increased 2% compared to 2012. Declines in heavier, more fuel-efficient coal shipments drove the variances in gross-ton-miles and the fuel consumption rate.  

Higher locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $3.22 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2012, compared to $3.12 in 2011, increased expenses by $105 million. Volume, as measured by gross ton-miles, decreased 2% in 2012 versus 2011, driving expense down. The fuel consumption rate was flat year-over-year.  

Purchased Services and Materials  Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroads lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and  

29  

Table of Contents 

 supplies. Expenses for purchased services increased 10% compared to 2012 due to logistics management fees, an increase in locomotive overhauls and repairs on jointly owned property.  

Expenses for contract services increased $103 million in 2012 versus 2011, primarily due to increased demand for transportation services purchased by our logistics subsidiaries for their customers and additional costs for repair and maintenance of locomotives and freight cars.  

Depreciation  The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation was up 1% compared to 2012. Recent depreciation studies allowed us to use longer estimated service lives for certain equipment, which partially offset the impact of a higher depreciable asset base resulting from larger capital spending in recent years.  

A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting ongoing capital spending, increased depreciation expense in 2012 compared to 2011.  

Equipment and Other Rents  Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses. Additional container costs resulting from the logistics management arrangement, and increased automotive shipments, partially offset by lower cycle times drove a $51 million increase in our short-term freight car rental expense versus 2012. Conversely, lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses partially offset the higher freight car rental expense.  

Increased automotive and intermodal shipments, partially offset by improved car-cycle times, drove an increase in our short-term freight car rental expense in 2012 compared to 2011. Conversely, lower locomotive lease expense partially offset the higher freight car rental expense.  

Other  Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal injury, environmental, employee travel, telephone and cellular, computer software, bad debt, and other general expenses. Higher property taxes and costs associated with damaged freight and property increased other costs in 2013 compared to 2012. Continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury, which reduced our personal injury expense year-over-year, partially offset increases in other costs.  

Other costs in 2012 were slightly higher than 2011 primarily due to higher property taxes. Despite continual improvement in our safety experience and lower estimated annual costs, personal injury expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011, as the liability reduction resulting from historical claim experience was less than the reduction in 2011.  

Non-Operating Items  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other Income  Other income increased in 2013 versus 2012 due to higher gains from real estate sales and increased lease income, including the favorable impact from the $17 million settlement of a land lease contract. These increases were partially offset by interest received from a tax refund in 2012.  

Other income decreased in 2012 versus 2011 due to lower gains from real estate sales and higher environmental costs associated with non-operating properties, partially offset by interest received from a tax refund.  

Interest Expense  Interest expense decreased in 2013 versus 2012 due to a lower effective interest rate of 5.7% in 2013 versus 6.0% in 2012. The increase in the weighted-average debt level to $9.6 billion in 2013 from $9.1 billion in 2012 partially offset the impact of the lower effective interest rate.  

Interest expense decreased in 2012 versus 2011 reflecting a lower effective interest rate in 2012 of 6.0% versus 6.2% in 2011 as the debt level did not materially change from 2011 to 2012.  

30  

Table of Contents 

Income Taxes  Higher pre-tax income increased income taxes in 2013 compared to 2012. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was relatively flat at 37.7% compared to 37.6% in 2012.  

Income taxes were higher in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily driven by higher pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 37.6% in 2012 compared to 37.5% in 2011.  

OTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS  

We report a number of key performance measures weekly to the Association of American Railroads (AAR). We provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml.  

Operating/Performance Statistics  

Railroad performance measures are included in the table below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [a]  As of January 1, 2014, we significantly changed the methodology for compiling our customer satisfaction information and, as a result, we will not include this index in future reports as no meaningful comparison is available.  

Note: Average rail car inventory is no longer being reported as a key railroad performance measure because of recently identified inaccuracies in the AARs calculation for the rail industry, which prevents comparisons to prior reporting periods. The impact of changes in rail car inventory will be described, as necessary, in connection with our discussion of train speed and/or terminal dwell metrics.  

Average Train Speed  Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals. Average train speed, as reported to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), decreased 2% in 2013 versus 2012. The decline was driven by severe weather conditions and shifts of traffic to sections of our network with higher utilization.  

Average train speed increased 4% in 2012 versus 2011. Efficient operations and relatively mild weather conditions during the year compared favorably to 2011, during which severe winter weather, flooding, and extreme heat and drought affected various parts of our network. We continued operating a fluid and efficient network while handling essentially the same volume and adjusting operations to accommodate increased capital project work on our network compared to 2011.  

Average Terminal Dwell Time  Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service. Average terminal dwell time increased 3% primarily due to continuing growth of manifest traffic which requires more time in terminals for switching cars and building trains. Average terminal dwell time remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011, despite a shift in traffic mix to more manifest shipments, which require more switching at terminals.  

Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles  Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. Gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles declined 1% in 2013 compared to 2012 and carloads remained relatively flat driven by declines in coal and agricultural products offset by growth in chemical, autos and industrial products. Gross ton-miles declined 2% in 2012 compared to 2011, while revenue ton-miles decreased 4% and carloads remained relatively flat. Changes in commodity mix drove the year-over-year variances between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloads.

Table of Contents 

Operating Ratio  Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue. Our operating ratio improved 1.7 points to a new record low of 66.1% in 2013 versus 2012. Core pricing and productivity gains more than offset the impact of inflation. Our operating ratio improved 2.9 points to a record low of 67.8% in 2012 versus 2011. Core pricing gains, improved fuel recovery provisions, efficient operations and cost reductions more than offset the impact of inflationary pressures  

Employees  Employee levels increased 1% in 2013 versus 2012. Shifts in our traffic mix, which requires more resources, largely concentrated in the Southern region, work related to higher capital investment in positive train control and more individuals in the training pipeline contributed to the higher employee levels. Employee levels increased 2% in 2012 versus 2011. Work related to the increase in capital investment, including positive train control, accounted for over half of the increase. Additionally, the shift in our traffic mix required more resources in the Southern region to support the growth in shale-related shipments.  

Customer Satisfaction Index  Our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes. A higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction. As of January 1, 2014, we significantly changed the methodology for compiling our customer satisfaction information and, as a result, we will not include this index in future reports as no meaningful comparison is available.  

Return on Average Common Shareholders Equity  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Return on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is Return on Average Common Shareholders Equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders equity to ROIC. Our 2013 ROIC improved 0.7 points compared to 2012, primarily as a result of higher earnings.

Debt to Capital / Adjusted Debt to Capital  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure, including off-balance sheet lease obligations, which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities. Operating leases were discounted using 5.7% and 6.0% at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The discount rate reflects our effective interest rate. We monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost-effective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital. Adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. The tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital. Our December 31, 2013 debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a $1.3 billion increase in equity from December 31, 2012, driven by higher earnings.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

As of December 31, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, our receivables securitization facility, and our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $1.8 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility, with no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2013. We did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2013. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the $600 million capacity receivables securitization facility was $0 as of December 31, 2013. Amounts outstanding under this facility are included in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt due after one year. Our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Companys $1.8 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.  

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a modest working capital surplus. This reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment. In addition, we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Operating Activities  

Higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012. In addition, we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations, which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012. Lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation (as discussed below) partially offset some of the increases.  

Higher net income in 2012 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2011, partially offset by lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation and payments for past wages based on national labor negotiations settled in 2012.  

Federal tax law provided for 100% bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011, and 50% bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012 and 2013. As a result, the Company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011, 2012 and 2013 income tax expense. This deferral decreased 2011, 2012 and 2013 income tax payments, thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow. In future years, however, income tax payments will increase as we pay these previously deferred income taxes.  

Investing Activities  

Lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012.  

Higher capital investments in 2012 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2011. Included in capital investments in 2012 was $75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions.  

The following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [a]  Other includes bridges and tunnels, signals, other road assets, and road work equipment.

Table of Contents [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Capital Plan  In 2014, we expect our total capital investments to be approximately $3.9 billion, which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. While the number of our assets replaced will fluctuate as part of our replacement strategy, for 2014 we expect to use over 60% of our capital investments to replace and improve existing capital assets. Among our major investment categories are replacing and improving track infrastructure and upgrading our locomotive, freight car and container fleets, including the acquisition of 200 locomotives. Additionally, we will continue increasing our network and terminal capacity, especially in the Southern region, and balancing terminal capacity with more mainline capacity. Construction of a major rail facility at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, will be completed in 2014 and will include a run-through and fueling facility as well as an intermodal ramp. We also plan to make significant investments in technology improvements, including approximately $450 million for PTC.  

We expect to fund our 2014 cash capital investments by using some or all of the following: cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, and cash on hand. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan, which we expect will enhance the long-term value of the Corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to (i) replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations, (ii) increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track, and (iii) make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth.  

Financing Activities  

Cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 versus 2012, driven by a $744 million increase for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2013 of $1.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2012. We increased our debt levels in 2013, which partially offset the increase in cash used in financing activities.  

Cash used in financing activities increased in 2012 versus 2011. Dividend payments in 2012 increased by $309 million, reflecting our higher dividend rate, and common stock repurchases increased by $56 million. Our debt levels did not materially change from 2011 after a decline in debt levels from 2010. Therefore, less cash was used in 2012 for debt activity than in 2011.  

Dividends  On February 6, 2014, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.91 per share, payable on April 1, 2014, to shareholders of record on February 28, 2014. We expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations and cash on hand at December 31, 2013.  

Credit Facilities  On December 31, 2013, we had $1.8 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility (the facility), which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during 2013. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The facility matures in 2015 under a four year term and requires the Corporation to maintain a debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing. At December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012 (and at all times during the year), we were in compliance with this covenant.  

The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain credit arrangements, capital leases, guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA. At December 31, 2013, the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to $42.4 billion of debt (as defined in the facility), and we had $9.9 billion of debt (as defined in the facility) outstanding at that date. Under our current capital plans, we expect to continue to satisfy the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio; however, many factors beyond our reasonable control  

35  

Table of Contents 

 could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The facility also includes a $75 million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.  

During 2013, we did not issue or repay any commercial paper, and at December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility.  

As of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, we have reclassified as long-term debt $0 and $100 million, respectively, of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance. This reclassification reflects our ability and intent to refinance any short-term borrowings and certain current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis.  

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges  

For each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 11.8, 10.4, and 8.4, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. (See Exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.)  

Common Shareholders Equity  

Dividend Restrictions  Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the Credit Facilities section above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends was $16.3 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  

Share Repurchase Program  

Effective April 1, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million shares of our common stock by March 31, 2014, replacing our previous repurchase program. As of December 31, 2013, we repurchased a total of $9.3 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs. The table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On November 21, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the early renewal of the share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of our common stock by December 31, 2017. The new authorization was effective January 1, 2014, and replaces the previous authorization, which expired on December 31, 2013, three months earlier than its original expiration date.  

Managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand. Repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.  

Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings  We filed an automatic shelf registration statement that became effective on February 8, 2013. The Board of Directors authorized the  

36  

Table of Contents 

 issuance of up to $4 billion of debt securities, replacing the $1.4 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed in February 2010. SEC rules require UPC, a large accelerated filer, to file a new shelf registration statement every three years. Under the current shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time.  

During 2013, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. At December 31, 2013, we had remaining authority to issue up to $2.85 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.  

In May 2012, we borrowed $100 million under a 4-year-term bank loan (the loan). The loan has a floating rate based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity. The agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility, including identical debt-to-net-worth covenant and change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions. The agreement does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers, or any other provision that would require us to post collateral.  

Subsequent Event  In 2014, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:  

  Date    Description of Securities  

  January 10, 2014   $300 million of 2.25% Notes due February 15, 2019 

    $400 million of 3.75% Notes due March 15, 2024 

     $300 million of 4.85% Notes due June 15, 2044  

Proceeds from this offering are for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. As of February 7, 2014, we had remaining authority from our Board of Directors to issue up to $1.85 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.  

Debt Exchange  On August 21, 2013, we exchanged $1,170 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2016 and 2040 (Existing Notes) for $439 million of 3.646% notes (New 2024 Notes) due February 15, 2024 and $700 million of 4.821% notes (New 2044 Notes) due February 1, 2044, plus cash consideration of approximately $280 million in addition to $8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments-Derecognition, this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange, as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt, and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the New 2024 Notes and the New 2044 Notes. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. Costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately $9 million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2013.

Table of Contents 

The following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Debt Redemptions  On May 14, 2013, we redeemed all $40 million of our outstanding 5.65% Port of Corpus Christi Authority Revenue Refunding Bonds due December 1, 2022. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $1 million in the second quarter of 2013.  

On November 30, 2012, we redeemed all $450 million of our outstanding 5.45% notes due January 31, 2013. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.  

On April 28, 2012, we redeemed all $100 million of our outstanding 5.70% Tooele County, Utah Hazardous Waste Treatment Revenue Bonds due November 1, 2026. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $2 million in the second quarter of 2012.  

On December 19, 2011, we redeemed the remaining $175 million of our 6.5% notes due April 15, 2012, and all $300 million of our outstanding 6.125% notes due January 15, 2012. The redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.  

Receivables Securitization Facility  The Railroad maintains a $600 million, 364-day receivables securitization facility under which it sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have no recourse to the Railroads other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.  

The amount outstanding under the facility was $0 and $100 million at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The facility was supported by $1.1 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at both December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  

The outstanding amount the Railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility, with a maximum of $600 million, may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase one percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change.  

The costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability. The costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were $5 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Table of Contents 

In July 2013, the $600 million receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional 364-day period at comparable terms and conditions.  

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.  

The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [a]  Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,702 million and unamortized discount of $(604) million. Includes an interest component of $6,025 million.  

 [b]  Includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate.  

 [c]  Represents total obligations, including interest component of $498 million.  

 [d]  Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for fuel purchases, locomotives, ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services. For amounts where we cannot reasonably estimate the year of settlement, they are reflected in the Other column.  

 [e]  Includes estimated other post retirement, medical, and life insurance payments, payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.  

 [f]  Future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2013. For amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain, they are reflected in the Other column.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [a]  None of the credit facility was used as of December 31, 2013.  

 [b]  None of the receivables securitization facility was utilized at December 31, 2013. The full program matures in July 2014.  

 [c]  Includes guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations.  

 [d]  None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2013.  

39  

Table of Contents 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Guarantees  At December 31, 2013, and 2012, we were contingently liable for $299 million and $307 million in guarantees. We have recorded a liability of $1 million and $2 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  

OTHER MATTERS  

Labor Agreements  Approximately 86% of our 46,445 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. In 2012, we concluded the most recent round of negotiations, which began in 2010, with the ratification of new agreements by several unions. All of the unions executed similar multi-year agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee health and welfare benefits and higher wages. The current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015.  

Inflation  Long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception, as well as our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.  

Market and Credit Risk  We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. We manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.  

Determination of Fair Value  We determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows.  

Sensitivity Analyses  The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.  

At December 31, 2013, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 2.2% of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2014 than our December 31, 2013 variable rate, which was approximately 0.9%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $2 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2013.  

Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2013, and amounts to an increase of approximately $1 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2013. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.  

40  

Table of Contents 

Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges  We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.  

Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short-cut method as allowed by the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding.  

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges  We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. At both December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had reductions of $1 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight-line basis through September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.  

Accounting Pronouncements  On February 5, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02), which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. We adopted this ASU during the three months ended March 31, 2013.  

Asserted and Unasserted Claims  Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.  

Indemnities  Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.  

Climate Change  Although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report), we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact. However, we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, using training programs to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment  

41  

Table of Contents 

 and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.  

Personal Injury  The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.  

Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 92% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 8% is related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2013. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $294 million to $322 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.  

Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:

Asbestos  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos. We assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims. This liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:  

       The ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation.  

       The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.  

       The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.  

       The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.  

Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 18% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 82% related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2013. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $131 million to $141 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.

In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2013, we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2013, and 2012. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.  

Environmental Costs  We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified 268 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 17 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.  

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, none of our environmental liability was discounted, while less than 1% of our environmental liability was discounted at 2.0% at December 31, 2011.  

Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

Our environmental site activity was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  

Property and Depreciation  Our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers. Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria. Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track. We use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items. We currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.  

We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies. We perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property. Our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:  

       Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes;  

       Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets;  

       Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and  

       Expected salvage to be received upon retirement.  

For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track. It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail). The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve). Our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives. For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile. Rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material. Based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2013, the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years. For all other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives

 of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies. Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.  

Estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets. We are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets. Actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.  

Changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $59 million. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $63 million. Our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes but did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense.  

Under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. Because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.  

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. During the last three fiscal years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties. A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations.  

Income Taxes  We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated. Future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For example, a 1% increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $370 million.  

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on managements judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. In 2013 and 2012, there were no valuation allowances.  

We recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  We use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make  

45

 several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For OPEB, the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate.  

We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:  

       Discount rate is based on a Mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds (rated AA by a recognized rating agency) for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plans expected benefit payments.  

       Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.  

       Health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.  

The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) for 2013 and the estimated impact on 2013 net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) relative to a change in those assumptions:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table presents the net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease to approximately $65 million in 2014 from $110 million in 2013. The decrease is driven mainly by an increase in the discount rate to 4.72%, Our net periodic OPEB expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million in 2014 from $14 million in 2013. The increase in our net periodic OPEB cost is primarily driven by a decrease in the amortization of prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive income.
