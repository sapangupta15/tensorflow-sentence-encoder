[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•LOCAL MEDIA: The Local Media segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company’s 30 owned broadcast television stations; and CBS Local Digital Media™, which operates local Websites including content from the Company’s television stations and news and sports radio stations.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, contributions to the Company’s consolidated revenues from its segments were as follows: Entertainment 67%, Cable Networks 16%, Publishing 6% and Local Media 14%. The Company generated approximately 14% of its total revenues from international regions in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 54% and 14% of total international revenues of approximately $1.85 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively.

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences, and to generate both advertising and non‑advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company continues to increase its investment in both Company-owned and acquired premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting its content on multiple digital platforms, including the Company’s owned digital streaming services, as well as third-party live television streaming offerings; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), including cable, direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”), telephone company, and other distributors, for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (also known as “retransmission fees”) and cable networks, and securing compensation from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees” also known as “reverse compensation”). The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits.

On February 2, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Entercom Communications Corp. to combine the Company’s radio business, CBS Radio, with Entercom in a merger to be effected through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which is expected to be tax-free to CBS Corp. and its stockholders. In connection with this transaction, the Company intends to split-off CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company’s stockholders may elect to exchange shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock for shares of CBS Radio, which will then be 

I-1

immediately converted into shares of Entercom common stock at the time of the merger. The merger and related transactions are collectively referred to as the “Radio Transaction”. The Radio Transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The Company expects to complete the Radio Transaction during the second half of 2017. CBS Radio, which was previously presented in the Company’s former Radio business segment, has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the disposition of CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. (“Outdoor Americas”), which was previously a subsidiary of the Company and has been renamed OUTFRONT Media Inc. Outdoor Americas has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

The Company competes with many different entities and media in various markets worldwide. In addition to competition in each of its businesses, the Company competes for opportunities in the entertainment business with other diversified entertainment companies such as The Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal Media, LLC, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and Time Warner Inc., and with respect to CBS Radio, Cumulus Media Inc. and iHeartMedia, Inc.

As of December 31, 2016, National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”), a closely held corporation that owns and operates approximately 925 movie screens in the U.S., the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and South America and manages 3 movie screens in South America, directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.5% of the Company’s voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately 9.5% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. Owners of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Company’s Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

The Company was organized in Delaware in 1986. The Company’s principal offices are located at 51 W. 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019. Its telephone number is (212) 975-4321 and its Website address is www.cbscorporation.com.

CBS CORP. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Entertainment (67%, 67% and 66% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 53%, 51% and 50% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)

The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network; CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution, the Company’s television production and syndication operations; CBS Interactive, the Company’s online content networks for information and entertainment; CBS Films, the Company’s producer and distributor of theatrical motion pictures; and the Company’s digital streaming services, CBS All Access and CBSN.

Television Network. The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment™, CBS News® and CBS Sports® distributes a comprehensive schedule of news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 16 of the Company’s owned and operated television stations, and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories.

The CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sale of advertising time for its network broadcasts. A significant portion of the sale of advertising spots for the network’s non-sports programming occurs annually generally during May through July in the industry’s upfront advertising market for the upcoming television broadcast season, which runs for one year generally commencing in mid-September. Advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming in the scatter advertising market. Overall advertising revenue for the network is also impacted by audience ratings for its programming. The Company offers dynamic advertising insertions for the CBS Television Network’s on-demand programming which allow the 

I-2

Company to change advertisements at any time within such programming and offer advertisers greater audience reach. In addition, the CBS Television Network’s revenues include station affiliation fees. 

CBS Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and drama series, reality‑based programming, specials, children’s programs, daytime dramas, game shows and late-night programs such as The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS Television Network and CBS Radio News™ with regularly scheduled news and public affairs broadcasts, including 60 Minutes, 48 Hours Mystery, CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley, CBS This Morning, CBS Sunday Morning and Face the Nation as well as special reports. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath®, a television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to the CBS Television Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts on the television network include The NFL Today; certain PGA Tour Golf Tournaments, the Masters and the PGA Championship; certain games from the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, the rights to which have been extended through 2032 under a March 2016 agreement with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.; regular-season college basketball games; regular-season college football games, including games from the Southeastern Conference and the NFL’s American Football Conference (AFC) regular-season, post-season wild card playoff, divisional playoff and championship games. In 2016, CBS broadcast Super Bowl 50, for which CBS Sports won three Sports Emmy®Awards, and certain AFC games in the 2016 season under its February 2014 agreement with the NFL to broadcast the AFC package from the 2014 through the 2022 seasons, which also includes certain National Football Conference regular season games and the Super Bowls in 2016, 2019 and 2022. The Company produced and broadcast certain NFL Thursday Night Football games for the 2016 season and will also do so for the 2017 season under its January 2016 agreement with the NFL.

CBS Television Network content also is exhibited via the internet, including through CBS.com™; CBSN, the Company’s live digital streaming advertiser-supported news network available 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and CBS All Access, the Company’s digital streaming subscription service which includes a commercial-free option for on-demand content announced in August 2016. CBS All Access offers both current and library programming as well as original series, such as the upcoming The Good Wife spin-off The Good Fight and Star Trek: Discovery. In December 2016, the Company commenced a multi-year deal with the NFL for the live, local NFL games broadcast by the CBS Television Network to be streamed on certain CBS All Access platforms. Digital streaming services such as CBS All Access and CBSN are also known as “over-the-top” or “OTT” services which provide video content via the internet to users without payment to a traditional MVPD. CBS All Access and CBSN are available at CBS.com and CBSNews.com™, respectively, and through CBS software applications (“apps”) on multiple digital platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon Fire and Windows 8 mobile platforms, and Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, PlayStation, Roku and Xbox connected device platforms, among others. In January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement for the digital streaming of the CBS Television Network’s programming on Hulu’s upcoming live television streaming service. During 2016, the CBS Television Network broadcast the 70th Annual Tony Awards®, the Kennedy Center Honors and the Grammy Awards®. In June 2016, the Company extended an agreement with The Recording Academy® to broadcast the Grammy Awards on the CBS Television Network through 2026. Furthering the Company’s analytic tools regarding television advertising and ratings, in 2016, the Company announced the “NYU Stern / CBS Media Analytics Initiative” to focus on the interactions between television and other media platforms and their influence on consumer exposure and behavior and “Purchase-Driven Planning” with Nielsen Catalina Solutions used to maximize return on investment across television and digital advertising campaigns, all of which supplement the Company’s “Campaign Performance Audit™,” a data-driven approach for analyzing and buying advertising time on broadcast television which helps advertising customers enhance consumer targeting and measure the effectiveness of their advertising.

The CW, a broadcast network and the Company’s 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, airs programming, including Jane the Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Supergirl and The Flash. Eight of the Company’s owned television stations are affiliates of The CW. Certain of The CW’s series are streamed on Netflix, a subscription video-on-demand service, including pursuant to output license agreements entered into with Netflix, Inc. in July 2016.

Television Production and Syndication. CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution produce, acquire and/or distribute programming worldwide, including series, specials, news and public affairs, and generate revenue principally from the licensing and distribution of such programming. The programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services or distribution via first‑run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The Company subsequently distributes programming after its initial exhibition on a network, basic cable network or premium subscription service for domestic exhibition on television stations, cable networks or video-on-demand services (known as “off-network syndicated programming”). Off-network syndicated programming and first‑run syndicated programming distributed domestically, as well as programming distributed internationally, can sometimes be sold in successive cycles of sales known as “first cycle,” “second cycle” sales, and so on, which may occur on exclusive or non-exclusive bases. Generally, license fees may decrease with successive sales cycles due to increased program exhibitions.

Programming that was produced or co-produced by the Company’s production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others, NCIS (CBS), Bull (CBS), Kevin Can Wait (CBS), Madam Secretary (CBS), Scorpion (CBS), Criminal Minds (CBS) and Jane the Virgin (The CW). Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period. Remaining distribution rights, including international and/or off‑network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or international markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the Company’s objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through various forms of distribution, including international licensing, domestic syndication and digital streaming of episodes. Generally, international sales of network series are made within one year of the U.S. network run and series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic off-network syndication; however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened, particularly for sales to digital streaming services. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series, such as Hawaii Five-O, Criminal Minds, Blue Bloods, The Good Wife, Elementary, NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles, as well as a library of older television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, The Insider, Dr. Phil, The Doctors, Rachael Ray, Hot Bench and Judge Judy and produces the upcoming series, The Good Wife spin-off The Good Fight, and Star Trek: Discovery, for streaming on CBS All Access. The Company also distributes syndicated and other programming internationally.

The Company continues to monetize its content through digital media. It enters into and renews numerous multi-year licensing agreements for distribution of certain of its programming to various services, including the digital streaming on subscription video-on-demand services owned by Netflix (in the U.S, Canada and countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America), Amazon (in the U.S., India, Germany and U.K.), Hulu, Hulu Plus (each, in the U.S.), Bell Media (in Canada), Canal Play (in France), DLA (in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean), Foxtel, Stan Entertainment (each, in Australia), iFlix (in Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines), Nippon TV (in Japan), PlayCo (in the Middle East), MultiChoice Africa (in sub-Saharan Africa), Sky TV NZ, Telecom NZ (each, in New Zealand), Telefonica (in Spain), Watchever (in Germany), among others; digital streaming on advertising supported video-on-demand services, such as PPTV (in China); Sony’s broadband pay television service, PlayStation Vue (in the U.S.); and the digital downloading on various electronic-sell-through services owned by Amazon (in the U.S., Germany and the U.K.), Apple (in the U.S., Canada, Australia and countries in Europe), Google (in the U.S. and U.K.) and Microsoft (in the U.S.), among others. In July 2016, the Company announced that its upcoming Star Trek: Discovery series as well as the existing Star Trek series library were licensed to Netflix in 188 countries (excluding the U.S. and Canada) and to Bell Media in Canada.

Fees for television programming licensed for syndication and digital streaming are recorded as revenues at the beginning of the license period in which the programs are made available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in the Entertainment segment’s operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $749 million and $847 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

CBS Interactive generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising and sponsorships, in addition to fees derived from search and commerce partners, licensing fees, subscriptions, e-commerce activities, and other paid services. Advertising spending on the internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly with economic conditions. In addition, online marketing spending follows seasonal consumer behavior throughout the calendar year to reflect trends during the calendar year.

I-5

the CBS News app. Through the CBS Audience Network™, the Company delivers video content from its digital properties and television stations and affiliated television stations under an advertiser-supported distribution model to third-party digital properties. The growing slate of the Company’s content available online includes full episodes, clips and highlights based on CBS, CBS Sports Network and Showtime Networks programming as well as original made-for-the-Web content.

CBS Films. CBS Films produces, acquires and distributes theatrical motion pictures across all genres. The budget for each picture is intended to be up to $50 million (or, in certain cases, higher where a co-financing partner is involved) plus advertising and marketing costs at a level consistent with industry custom. The majority of motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films is intended for a wide, commercial theatrical release, similar to motion pictures typically produced and released by major studios. CBS Films’ theatrical releases in 2016 were Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life, Hell or High Water and Patriots Day. In 2017, CBS Films’ expected theatrical releases are Dean, The Sense of An Ending and American Assassin.

In general, motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films are exhibited theatrically in the U.S. and internationally, followed by exploitation via home entertainment (including DVDs and Blu-ray Discs and electronic rental and sell-through), video-on-demand, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and basic cable, digital media outlets, including subscription video-on-demand, and, in some cases, other channels such as airlines and hotels. CBS Films exploits its motion pictures (including certain ancillary rights such as licensing and merchandising) and generates revenues in all media in the relevant release windows either directly, through affiliated CBS entities, or via third-party distribution arrangements, including CBS Films’ multi-year agreement with Lions Gate Films, which was entered into in November 2014, for Lions Gate Films to distribute CBS Films’ new wide-release motion pictures in all media, except U.S. pay television.

Entertainment Competition.

Television Network. The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in broadcast television are the development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks, such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, independent television stations, cable program services, as well as other media, including DVDs and Blu‑ray Discs, digital program services, print and the internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience.

Television Production and Syndication. As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups, and independent producers and syndicators, such as Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony and Warner Bros., to produce and sell programming both domestically and internationally. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company’s entertainment businesses.

CBS Interactive. CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including the following: general purpose portals, such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing; online comparison shopping and retail properties, including Amazon.com; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive’s brands serve such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, entertainment and lifestyle focused digital properties; other content sites and apps, such as ESPN.com, HBO GO, Hulu and Netflix, as well as major television broadcast company digital properties, including digital streaming services and apps; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media companies that provide both online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.

I-6

CBS Films. Motion picture production and distribution is a highly competitive business. During the life cycle of the development and production of a motion picture project, CBS Films must compete for the rights to compelling underlying source material and talent such as writers, producers, directors, on-screen performers and other creative personnel. CBS Films must also compete with other buyers for the acquisition of third-party produced motion pictures. Once a motion picture is completed or acquired, CBS Films must compete with numerous other motion pictures produced and/or distributed by various studios and independent producers, including Paramount Pictures Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment, STX Entertainment, The Weinstein Company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Lakeshore Entertainment Group, among others, for audience acceptance as well as limited exhibition outlets across all of the relevant release windows. In addition, the ultimate consumer has many options for entertainment other than motion pictures including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities.

Cable Networks (16%, 18% and 17% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 33%, 37% and 37% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)

The Cable Networks segment is composed of Showtime Networks, which operates the Company’s premium subscription program services, including a digital streaming subscription offering; CBS Sports Network, the Company’s cable network focused on college athletics and other sports; and Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel and a digital streaming subscription service.

Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks owns and operates three commercial-free, premium subscription program services in the U.S.: Showtime, offering original series, recently released theatrical feature films, documentaries, boxing and other sports-related programming, and special events; The Movie Channel, offering recently released theatrical feature films and related programming; and Flix, offering theatrical feature films primarily from the last several decades; and a digital streaming subscription offering of the Showtime service which launched in July 2015. At December 31, 2016, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate, had approximately 76 million subscriptions in the U.S., certain U.S. territories and Bermuda.

Showtime Networks makes versions of Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix available on-demand, enabling television subscribers to watch individual programs at their convenience. Showtime Networks also makes available Showtime Anytime®, an authenticated version of Showtime, which can be accessed on computers via showtimeanytime.com™ or via certain internet-connected devices through a Showtime Anytime app free of charge to Showtime subscribers as part of their Showtime subscription through participating Showtime Networks’ distributors. Through Showtime Anytime, Showtime subscribers can view on-demand programming as well as the live telecast of the east and west coast feeds of Showtime. Showtime Networks additionally operates the Website SHO.com™ which promotes Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix programming, and provides information and entertainment and other services. Showtime Networks also makes available a digital streaming subscription offering of the Showtime service for purchase by consumers without a traditional MVPD video subscription. This offering allows subscribers to view on-demand programming as well as the live east and west coast linear feeds of Showtime, and is available at showtime.com™, through the Showtime app on multiple digital platforms, and as an add-on subscription to Amazon Prime, Hulu or Sony’s PlayStation Vue.

Showtime Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous MVPDs, with a substantial portion of such revenue coming from three of the largest such distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for Showtime and The Movie Channel, from motion picture studios and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations, including exclusive motion picture output agreements with CBS Films, Open Road Films, STX Entertainment, Amblin Partners and, for certain DreamWorks motion pictures, Buena Vista Pay Television, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. Showtime Networks’ original series telecast in 2016 included Ray Donovan, Billions, Masters of Sex, The Affair, The Circus, Penny Dreadful, Shameless and House of Lies, among others. In 2016, Showtime Networks also telecast various sports-related programs, including Inside the NFL, 60 Minutes Sports 

I-7

and A Season With Florida State Football, and documentaries such as Weiner, Michael Jackson’s Journey from Motown to Off the Wall and Madonna: Rebel Heart Tour.

Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of its original programming. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with television networks, internet content distributors, such as Amazon and Netflix, and/or other media companies for the exhibition of certain Showtime original programming domestically and in various international territories. For example, the Company has output agreements with Bell Media Inc. for Canada, and with Sky-affiliated entities for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the U.K. The Company entered into an output agreement in January 2016 with Stan Entertainment PTY Limited for Australia, and an output agreement in September 2016 with Moviestar+ for Spain.

Showtime Networks also owns a majority of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel, a basic cable service in the U.S., featuring programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature. Smithsonian Networks offers a companion on-demand version, makes Smithsonian Channel content available on an authenticated basis to certain distributors in the U.S. and licenses Smithsonian Channel content outside of the U.S., including to Blue Ant Television Ltd. in connection with Smithsonian Channel in Canada. In September 2016, Smithsonian Networks launched Smithsonian Channel in Singapore. Smithsonian Networks also operates the Website SmithsonianChannel.com™ and various apps, which promote Smithsonian Channel programming and provide information and entertainment services. Smithsonian Networks also operates Smithsonian Earth™, its digital streaming subscription service featuring original nature and wildlife content in ultra-high definition resolution (4K), which is available to consumers without a traditional MVPD video subscription. Consumers can subscribe to Smithsonian Earth on multiple digital platforms, including Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV and Prime.

CBS Sports Network. CBS Sports Network is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week cable program service that provides sports and related content, with a strong focus on college sports. The network televises over 600 live professional, amateur, semi-professional and collegiate events annually, highlighted by Division I college football, basketball, hockey and lacrosse, as well as professional bull riding (PBR), professional lacrosse (MLL), arena football (AFL), World’s Toughest Mudder, and various styles of motor sports events (including asphalt, dirt, and off road racing). In addition, the network showcases a variety of original programming, including documentaries, features and studio shows, highlighted by That Other Pre-Game Show (TOPS), NFL Monday QB, Inside College Basketball, Inside College Football, Time to Schein and a first of its kind all-female panel talk show, We Need to Talk. CBS Sports Network also provides ancillary coverage for CBS Sports relating to major events, such as the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, Masters Tournament and PGA Championship, and for Showtime Networks relating to Showtime Championship Boxing. CBS Sports Network produces weekday simulcasts of the radio shows Boomer and Carton and The Doug Gottlieb Show. Further, CBS Sports Network televises a diverse slate of additional programming under the CBS Sports Spectacular™ brand, including mixed martial arts, skiing, bowling, surfing, boxing, horse racing, volleyball, cheerleading and skate boarding, among other events. CBS Sports Network had approximately 55 million subscribers as of December 31, 2016. The network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising. CBS Sports Network has secured carriage arrangements with the top MVPDs. The Company also has agreements for the digital streaming of CBS Sports Network programming on several digital streaming services, including Hulu’s upcoming live television streaming service.

Cable Networks Competition.

Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the U.S., including Home Box Office, Inc. and Starz, LLC. Competition among these premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks’ premium subscription program 

I-8

services to subscribers. In addition, Showtime Networks competes with non-traditional subscription programming services delivered via the internet, such as Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, for original programming, theatrical motion pictures and viewership. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with basic cable program services, broadcast television and other media, including video games and other internet apps.

Smithsonian Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non‑fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media.

CBS Sports Network. CBS Sports Network principally competes with cable programming services, including other sports‑oriented cable programming services, for distribution and license fee revenue among MVPDs, as well as for viewership and advertising revenue. The effects of consolidation among MVPDs and consumer pricing sensitivity have made it more difficult for niche channels to secure broad distribution in mainstream programming packages. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for sports programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration or acceptance. CBS Sports Network continues its repositioning to be included in programming packages with more subscribers. Re-alignment of college athletic conferences and their member institutions may adversely impact CBS Sports Network’s programming arrangements. CBS Sports Network also competes with cable programming services generally, including other sports programming services, such as ESPN, FOX Sports Networks and NBC Sports Network, in acquiring the television and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.

The terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company’s subscription program services are important to the Company. The effects of consolidation among MVPDs and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach and maintain favorable terms and positioning and could have an adverse effect on revenues.

Publishing (6% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, and 4% of the Company’s total segment operating income in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014)

The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster, which publishes and distributes consumer books in the U.S. and internationally.

Simon & Schuster publishes and distributes adult and children’s consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats in the U.S. and internationally. Its digital formats include electronic books and audio books. Simon & Schuster’s major adult imprints include Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner, Atria Books, Gallery Books, Touchstone and Howard Books®. Simon & Schuster’s major children’s imprints include Simon Pulse®, Aladdin®, Atheneum Books for Young Readers®, Margaret K. McElderry Books™, Saga Press™ and Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers™. Simon & Schuster also develops special imprints and publishes titles based on the products of certain CBS businesses as well as that of third parties and distributes products for other publishers. Simon & Schuster distributes its products directly and through third parties. Simon & Schuster also delivers content and promotes its products on its own Websites, social media, general internet sites as well as those dedicated to individual titles. Its created assets include online videos showcasing Simon & Schuster authors and new releases on AOL, YouTube, Amazon, Bio.com, MSN.com, Google Newsstand, iTunes, SimonandSchuster.com and other sites. International publishing includes the international distribution of English-language titles through Simon & Schuster UK, Simon & Schuster Canada, Simon & Schuster Australia, Simon & Schuster India and other distributors, as well as the publication of locally originated titles by its international companies.

In 2016, Simon & Schuster had 277 New York Times bestsellers in hardcover, paperback and electronic formats, collectively, including 33 New York Times #1 bestsellers. Best-selling titles in 2016 include Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen, A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman and End of Watch by Stephen King. Best-selling children’s titles include Lady Midnight by Cassandra Clare, Dork Diaries 11: Tales from a Not-So-Friendly Frenemy by Rachel Renée Russell and Rush Revere and The Presidency by Rush Limbaugh and Kathryn Adams Limbaugh.

Schuster Digital™, through SimonandSchuster.com, publishes original content, builds reader communities and promotes and sells Simon & Schuster’s books over the internet.

The consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end‑of‑year holiday season. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster’s sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster’s top two accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. In 2016, the sale of digital content represented approximately 23% of Simon & Schuster’s revenues. The Company expects that electronic books will continue to represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming years. 

Publishing Competition. The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected over the years by consolidation trends and electronic distribution methods and models. Mass merchandisers and on‑line retailers are significant factors in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. The growth of the electronic book market has impacted print book retailers and wholesalers and could result in a reduction of these channels for the sales and marketing of the Company’s books. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions and competition may adversely affect book retailers’ operations, including distribution of the Company’s books. The Company must compete with other larger publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Hachette and HarperCollins, for the rights to works by authors and sales to retailers and customers. Competition is particularly strong for well‑known authors and public personalities. In addition, technological changes have made it increasingly possible for authors to self‑publish and have led to the development of new digital distribution models in which the Company’s books must compete with the availability of both a larger volume of books as well as non‑book content.

Local Media (14%, 12% and 13% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 22%, 19% and 20% of the Company’s total segment operating income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)

The Local Media segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company’s 30 owned broadcast television stations, all of which operate under licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The licenses are renewable every eight years. The Company’s television stations are located in the 6 largest, and 15 of the top 20, television markets in the U.S. The Company owns multiple television stations within the same designated market area (“DMA”) in 10 major markets. These multiple station markets are: New York (market #1), Los Angeles (market #2), Philadelphia (market #4), Dallas-Fort Worth (market #5), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (market #6), Boston (market #9), Detroit (market #13), Miami-Ft. Lauderdale (market #16), Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto (market #20), and Pittsburgh (market #23). This group of television stations enables the Company to reach a wide audience within and across geographically diverse markets in the U.S. The stations produce news and broadcast public affairs, sports and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS, The CW or MyNetworkTV programming and syndicated programming. The CBS Television Stations group principally derives its revenues from the sale of advertising time on its television stations. In addition, the CBS Television Stations group receives retransmission fees from MVPDs for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations. The Company also has agreements for the digital streaming of the Company’s owned television stations on several digital streaming services, including Hulu’s upcoming live television streaming service. The Company’s digital streaming subscription service, CBS All Access, offers an extensive on-demand selection of both current programming and library, original series as well as the ability to stream live programming from local CBS Television Stations and certain CBS television station affiliates. CBS All Access is available at CBS.com and through the CBS app on multiple digital platforms. The Company’s television stations have a digital presence on CBS Local Websites which are operated by CBS Local Digital Media. The CBS Local Websites and related apps promote the Company’s stations’ programming as well as provide live and on-demand news, traffic, weather, entertainment and sports information, among other services for their local communities. CBS Radio’s local sports and news radio stations also have a digital presence on CBS Local Websites which is expected to continue for specified periods after the closing of the Radio Transaction pursuant to a digital services agreement with the Company. The CBS Local Websites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising. The “Television Stations and CBS Local Digital Media Websites” table below includes information with respect to these properties within U.S. television markets. CBS Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting own and operate through an 

I-10

approximately 50/50 joint venture DECADES™, a national entertainment program service featuring classic television content, movies and original programming for local television stations’ digital sub-channels, which utilize a local television station's available broadcast spectrum to provide a companion to that station's primary channel.

Local Media Competition. Television stations compete for programming, on‑air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The owned and operated television stations’ competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal. The Company’s television stations face increasing competition from technologies such as audio and visual content delivered via the internet, which create new ways for audiences to consume content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertising. The Company’s television stations’ Websites face competition for advertisers and visitors from other digital sources of local content.

REGULATION

The Company’s businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S. and of national, regional and local authorities in foreign countries. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company’s businesses.

Intellectual Property and Privacy

Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See “Intellectual Property” on page I-16 for more information on the Company’s brands).

Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy. Unauthorized distribution, reproduction or display of copyrighted material in digital formats without regard to content owners’ copyright rights in television programming, motion pictures, clips and books, such as through pirated DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, unauthorized stored copies and live streaming, internet downloads, file “sharing” and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property. The Company’s digital delivery services and commercial arrangements with digital content providers help reduce the risks associated with unauthorized access to its content. The Company is also engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and participates in various litigation, public relations programs and legislative activity. These business strategies and enforcement efforts are dependent upon laws and practices that protect the rights of creators and authorized distributors of content. 

Laws and Content. The Company derives revenues from the creation and exploitation of creative content, for which the copyright law grants certain exclusive rights, including to reproduce, publicly perform and distribute. The duration of the protection afforded to the Company’s intellectual property depends on the type of property and the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction. Any changes to copyright laws or related regulations that enable the Company to control the distribution of its content, including through court decisions, which diminish the scope of a copyright owner’s exclusive rights, could impact the Company. Proposed legal amendments, such as to the law governing territorial exclusivity of the distribution of content in Europe, could adversely impact the Company’s ability to control and distribute its content.

Privacy. The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company’s interactive businesses. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its Websites, digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs.

Broadcasting

General. Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations’ frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.

Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of MVPDs and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.

Indecency and Profanity Regulation. The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is approximately $383,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $3.5 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material.

License Renewals. Television and radio broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has no pending renewal applications. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending.

License Assignments. The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Third parties may oppose the Company’s applications to assign, transfer or acquire broadcast licenses.

Ownership Regulation. The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have certain official positions or ownership interests, known as “attributable” interests, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition of a broadcast television or radio station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC’s ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest.

In August 2016, the FCC issued an Order as part of its quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership rules (the “2016 FCC Order”) that largely retained the existing rules, which are briefly summarized below. However, several parties have petitioned the FCC to reconsider this decision and the FCC may relax certain of these rules in 2017, including those related to local television ownership.

Local Television Ownership. Under the FCC’s local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top-four ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the FCC, and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations would remain in the market following the acquisition of the second television station. The 2016 FCC Order modified the local television station ownership rule to prohibit transactions involving the sale or swap of 

I-13

network affiliations between same-market television station owners that would result in an entity holding an attributable interest in two top-four ranked television stations. Further, without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap. “Satellite” television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a “parent” television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the “parent” station.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation. Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. In a separate September 2016 decision, the FCC eliminated the UHF discount, pursuant to which a UHF television station was attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. This action is under reconsideration by the FCC, which may lead to the reinstatement of the UHF discount in 2017. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households not taking into account the UHF discount. 

Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule. The radio-television cross-ownership rule limits the common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market. The cross-ownership rule may in certain circumstances be more restrictive than the rules that separately limit the ownership of local television stations or local radio stations. The numeric limit under the cross-ownership rule varies according to the number of independent media voices in the market. The Company is in compliance with the cross-ownership rule.

Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership. The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule, which was largely left unchanged by the 2016 FCC Order, prohibits the common ownership of a television or radio station and daily newspaper in the same market absent a waiver by the FCC. 

Local Radio Ownership. The FCC’s local radio ownership rule applies in all markets where the Company owns radio stations. Under that rule, one party may own up to eight radio stations in the largest markets, no more than five of which may be either AM or FM. With a few exceptions, the rule permits the common ownership of 8 radio stations in the top 50 markets, where CBS Radio has significant holdings.

Dual Network Rule. The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.

Attribution of Ownership. Under the FCC’s attribution rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various types of securities of an entity which holds FCC licenses, such as the Company, could violate the foregoing FCC ownership regulations or policies if that purchaser owned or acquired an “attributable” interest in other media properties. Under the FCC’s rules, an “attributable” interest for purposes of the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules generally includes: equity and debt interests which combined exceed 33% of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensee’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest, whether television, radio, cable or newspaper; a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless the interest holder is properly “insulated” from management activities; and any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent. The FCC is reviewing its single majority voting stockholder attribution exemption, which renders as non‑attributable voting interests up to 49% in a licensee controlled by a single majority voting stockholder. Because NAI holds an attributable interest in both the Company and Viacom Inc., the business of each company is attributable to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities”).

Alien Ownership. In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 25% of the voting power or equity of the Company. In September 2016, the FCC clarified 

I-14

and expanded certain rules and procedures and adopted and standardized filing and review procedures for broadcasters seeking to obtain FCC consent to exceed the 25% threshold.

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either “must carry” status, pursuant to which the cable system’s carriage of the station is mandatory, or “retransmission consent,” pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company’s owned television stations have elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases, and, since 2006, the Company has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.

Similarly, federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect “must carry” or “retransmission consent” status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to cable systems. The Company’s owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements.

Children’s Television Programming. Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display during children’s programming of internet addresses of Websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.

Program Access. Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms or conditions for programming to competing MVPDs unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC’s regulations. Until 2012, the FCC’s “program access” rules also generally prohibited vertically integrated cable programmers from entering into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable operators. The FCC continues to assess the competitive impact of such individual exclusive contracts. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC’s program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned in whole or in part by either a cable operator or a telephone company that provides video programming directly to subscribers.

The Company’s wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company’s flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.’s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC’s program access rules. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities”).

National Broadband Plan. In response to the FCC’s March 2010 National Broadband Plan, which seeks to provide affordable broadband access throughout the U.S., Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions to reclaim spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. The television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC “repacks” the remaining spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use after the auctions. The legislation provides that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas, no UHF band stations will be forced into the VHF band and a fund will be established to reimburse broadcasters for reasonable 

I-15

relocation expenses relating to the spectrum‑repacking. These spectrum auctions commenced in May 2016 and are expected to conclude in 2017.
