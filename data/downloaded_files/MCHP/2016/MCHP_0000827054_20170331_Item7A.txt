Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal, meets liquidity needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations, and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions. Our investment portfolio, consisting of fixed income securities, money market funds, cash deposits, and marketable securities that we hold on an available-for-sale basis, was $1,410.2 million as of March 31, 2017 compared to $2,564.6 million as of March 31, 2016. We sold a significant portion of our available-for-sale investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to partially finance the purchase price of our Atmel acquisition which closed on April 4, 2016. Our available-for-sale debt securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and, therefore, we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase. The following table provides information about our available-for-sale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of March 31, 2017. We have aggregated our available-for-sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature (dollars in thousands):
