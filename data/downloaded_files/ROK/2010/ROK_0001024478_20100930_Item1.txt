Item 1. Business  

General  

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985. Our products and services are designed to meet our customers needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce manufacturing business risk.  

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1996 in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RICs shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928.  

We divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses in 2007. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. The results of operations of these businesses are reported in income from discontinued operations in the Financial Statements for all periods presented.  

As used herein, the terms we, us, our, the Company or Rockwell Automation include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.  

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 1, 2011 (the 2011 Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), or in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (the Financial Statements), the information is incorporated in that Item by reference. All date references to years and quarters refer to our fiscal year and quarters unless otherwise stated.

Geographic Information  

In 2010, sales to customers in the United States accounted for 51 percent of our total sales. Outside the United States, we sell in every region. The largest sales outside the United States on a country-of-destination basis are in Canada, China, Italy, the United Kingdom and Brazil. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our operations outside of the United States. Sales and property information by major geographic area for each of the past three years is contained in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.  

Competition  

Depending on the product or service involved, our competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies that specialize in niche products and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology leadership, knowledge of customer applications, installed base, distribution network, quality of products and services, global presence and price.  

Distribution  

In the United States and Canada, we sell our products, solutions and services primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. Outside the United States and Canada, we sell products, solutions and services through a combination of our direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through independent distributors. Globally, our independent distributors typically do not carry products that compete with Allen-Bradley® products. Sales to our largest distributor in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately 10 percent of our total sales.  

Research and Development  

Our research and development spending for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $198.9 million, $170.0 million, and $191.3 million, respectively. Customer-sponsored research and development was not significant in 2010, 2009 or 2008.  

Employees  

At September 30, 2010 we had approximately 19,000 employees. Approximately 8,000 were employed in the United States.  

Raw Materials and Supplies  

We purchase many items of equipment, components and materials used to produce our products from others. The raw materials essential to the conduct of each of our business segments generally are available at competitive prices. Although we have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors, we depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers.  

Backlog  

Our total order backlog at September 30 was (in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods due to the short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities. Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond 2011 were approximately $117.0 million as of September 30, 2010.

Environmental Protection Requirements  

Information about the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks  

We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and operations. Various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been made to us. We believe that none of these claims or requests will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. While in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property.  

The Companys name and its registered trademark Rockwell Automation® and other trademarks such as Allen-Bradley® and A-B® are important to both of our business segments. In addition, we own other important trademarks that we use, such as ICS TriplexTM for our control products and systems for industrial automation, and Rockwell Software® and FactoryTalk® for our software products.  

Seasonality  

Our business segments are not subject to significant seasonality. However, the calendarization of our results can vary and may be affected by the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules.
