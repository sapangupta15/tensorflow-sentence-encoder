Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Results of Operations  

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshires corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate tone at the top messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  

Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $1.2 billion in 2015, a decline of $530 million from 2014, which reflected rising claim costs at GEICO and lower earnings from our reinsurers, partially offset by increased earnings from our other primary insurance operations. In 2014, earnings from underwriting declined $303 million compared to 2013, which was primarily due to lower earnings from reinsurance.  

Our railroad business generated a 9.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. Results in 2015 were positively impacted by improved service levels and lower fuel costs. Railroad earnings increased 2.0% in 2014 compared to 2013, although earnings were negatively impacted by various service-related challenges during the year.  

After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy businesses in 2015 increased 13.3% over 2014, which increased 28.0% over 2013. Earnings in 2015 and 2014 benefitted from the inclusion of newly-acquired businesses (AltaLink beginning in December 2014 and NV Energy beginning in December 2013) and higher earnings from several of our other energy businesses.  

After-tax earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2015 increased 4.8% in the aggregate over 2014. In 2015, the positive impacts of business acquisitions and higher earnings from our building products businesses were partly offset by lower earnings from certain of our industrial products and service businesses. Earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2014 increased 15.2% over 2013, reflecting the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions, earnings growth in certain operations and reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.  

After-tax investment and derivative gains/losses were approximately $6.7 billion in 2015, $3.3 billion in 2014 and $4.3 billion in 2013. In 2015, after-tax gains included a non-cash holding gain of approximately $4.4 billion that was realized in connection with our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock. In 2014, after-tax gains included approximately $2.0 billion related to the exchanges of Phillips 66 common stock and Graham Holdings Company common stock for a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. After-tax investment gains in 2013 included gains associated with the fair value increases of certain investment securities where unrealized gains or losses were reflected in periodic earnings. Derivative contracts contributed after-tax gains of $633 million in 2015, $329 million in 2014 and $1.7 billion in 2013. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued)  

InsuranceUnderwriting  

We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.  

Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses.  

The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. We define pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a single event or series of related events as significant. In 2015, we recorded estimated losses of $136 million in connection with a property loss event in China. In 2014, we did not incur any significant catastrophe losses. In 2013, we incurred pre-tax losses of $436 million related to two catastrophe events in Europe. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $73.1 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2015 may develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings.  

Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rates can be volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings can be relatively significant.  

A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. A measure of capital strength is combined shareholders equity determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Statutory Surplus). Statutory Surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $124 billion at December 31, 2015. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued)  

GEICO  

GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICOs policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICOs underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased 11.5% and 10.8%, respectively, over 2014. The increases in premiums reflected growth in voluntary auto policies-in-force (5.4%) and rate increases. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2015 exceeded 2014 by about 1%. In 2015, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by 707,000 policies.  

In 2015, pre-tax underwriting gains were $460 million compared to $1.16 billion in 2014 and $1.13 billion in 2013. Throughout 2015, we experienced increases in claims frequencies and severities across all of our major coverages. Our loss ratio, which is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned, in 2015 was 82.1% compared to 77.7% in 2014. As a result, we continue to implement premium rate increases where necessary.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2015 increased $2.7 billion (17.1%) over 2014. Claims frequencies (claim counts per exposure unit) in 2015 increased in all major coverages over 2014, including property damage and collision coverages (three to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (four to six percent range) and personal injury protection (PIP) coverage (one to two percent range). Average claims severities were also higher in 2015 for property damage and collision coverages (four to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (six to seven percent range) and PIP coverage (two to four percent range). We believe that increases in miles driven, repair costs (parts and labor) and medical costs, as well as weather conditions contributed to the increases in frequencies and severities.  

Underwriting expenses in 2015 increased 5.8% to $3.6 billion. The largest components of underwriting expenses are employee-related costs (salaries and benefits) and advertising. During 2015, these costs grew at a slower rate than premiums. As a result, our expense ratio (the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2015 declined 0.7 percentage points compared to 2014.  

Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $1.88 billion (9.8%) and $1.92 billion (10.4%), respectively, compared to premiums written and earned in 2013. These increases were attributable to an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 6.6% and increased average premium per policy. Voluntary auto new business sales increased about 1.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013 and voluntary auto policies-in-force increased 821,000 policies during 2014.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2014 increased $1.7 billion (11.7%) to $15.9 billion. In 2014, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages increased in the three to four percent range over 2013, partially due to more severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2014. Claims frequencies for bodily injury coverage increased about one percent, while frequencies for personal injury protection decreased three to four percent. Physical damage severities increased one to two percent in 2014 and bodily injury severities decreased in the one to two percent range from severities in 2013. Overall, personal injury protection severities were relatively unchanged although we experienced relatively large, but offsetting, changes by jurisdiction.  

Underwriting expenses in 2014 increased $223 million (7.0%) to $3.4 billion. The increase reflected the increased policy acquisition costs to generate the growth in policies-in-force and increased other operating expenses.

General Re  

General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. In 2015, we changed the allocation of certain underwriting expenses related to a global systems implementation project among our business units. There was no impact on consolidated results. Prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentations. General Res underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

In 2015, property/casualty premiums written declined $532 million (16%), while premiums earned decreased $298 million (10%), as compared to 2014. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written and earned in 2015 declined 9% and 2%, respectively, compared to 2014. Our premium volume declined in both the direct and broker markets worldwide. Insurance industry capacity remains high and price competition in most property/casualty reinsurance markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. However, we remain prepared to write substantially more business when more appropriate prices can be attained relative to the risks assumed.  

Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $150 million in 2015 and $204 million in 2014. In 2015, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $289 million compared to $445 million in 2014. The comparative decrease in underwriting gains from property business was driven by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio, reflecting a relative increase in reported losses. The property results in 2015 included estimated incurred losses of $50 million from an explosion in Tianjin, China. There were no significant catastrophe losses during 2014. Our property business results in both years benefitted from reductions of estimated losses for prior years exposures. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results.  

In 2015 and 2014, our casualty/workers compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $139 million and $241 million, respectively. Underwriting results in each year included net losses on current year business, driven by our prudent reserving philosophy that reflects the inherent uncertainty in long-tail exposures. These losses were partially offset by gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years business of $150 million in 2015 and $123 million in 2014, which were net of recurring charges for discount accretion on workers compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period means that the ultimate liability estimates currently established will continue to develop favorably.  

Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $285 million (9.6%) and $96 million (3.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written and earned in 2014 increased 8% and 3%, respectively, reflecting increases in treaty participations as well as growth in our facultative and primary casualty businesses.  

Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $204 million in 2014 and $171 million in 2013. Our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $445 million in 2014 and $140 million in 2013. Underwriting results in 2013 included $400 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to a hailstorm ($280 million) and floods ($120 million) in Europe. In both 2014 and 2013, property results benefitted from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years exposures. The favorable development in each period was primarily attributable to lower than expected losses reported from ceding companies.  

Our casualty/workers compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $241 million in 2014 and underwriting gains of $31 million in 2013. Casualty/workers compensation underwriting results included gains from reductions of estimated ultimate losses on prior years business of $123 million in 2014 and $354 million in 2013, which included charges related to discount accretion on workers compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges pertaining to retroactive reinsurance contracts.

Life/health  

In 2015, life/health premiums written and earned were relatively unchanged from 2014. However, adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2015 increased $266 million (8%) as compared to 2014. In 2015, life business increased across a number of non-U.S. markets, particularly in Canada and Asia.  

Our life/health business produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting losses in 2015 of $18 million compared to gains of $73 million in 2014. In 2015, our North American long-term care business generated increased underwriting losses of $77 million compared to 2014 due primarily to increased reserves from estimated premium deficiencies. Also we experienced higher frequency and severity of losses in North American individual life business, which were partially offset by increased underwriting gains from international life business.  

Premiums written and earned in 2014 increased $170 million (5.7%) and $184 million (6.2%), respectively, compared to 2013. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2014 increased 8% over 2013, which primarily derived from life business across a number of non-U.S. markets.  

Our life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $73 million in 2014 compared to $112 million in 2013. In 2014, we increased benefit liabilities by approximately $50 million as a result of reducing discount rates for certain European long-term care and disability business. In 2014, we also experienced increased frequency and severity of claims in Australian disability business.  

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  

BHRG underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in the periodic underwriting results. Occasionally, BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events arising under property/casualty coverages. BHRGs underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased $605 million (15%) and $352 million (9%), respectively, compared to 2014. These increases were primarily attributable to a new 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG), which became effective on July 1, 2015. Partially offsetting this increase were premium declines in property catastrophe, property quota-share and London facilities business. Our premium volume is generally constrained for most property/casualty coverages, and for property catastrophe coverages in particular as rates, in our view, are inadequate. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained.  

The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2015 of $944 million compared to $1.4 billion in 2014. In 2015, we incurred losses of $86 million from an explosion in Tianjin, China. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2014. Underwriting results in 2015 included comparatively lower gains from property catastrophe reinsurance and the run off of prior years business.  

Premiums earned in 2014 were $4.1 billion, a decline of $1.1 billion (21%) compared to 2013. Premiums earned in 2014 with respect to a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (Swiss Re) declined $1.3 billion from premiums earned in 2013. The Swiss Re contract expired at the end of 2012 and is in run-off. Property catastrophe premiums earned in 2014 declined $113 million (14%) as compared to 2013. These declines were partially offset by increased premiums earned from property quota-share contracts.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)  

Property/casualty (Continued)  

The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $1.4 billion in 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. In each year, the underwriting gains were primarily attributable to our property business, which benefitted from relatively low loss ratios, and the favorable run-off of prior years business, including the Swiss Re contract.  

Retroactive reinsurance  

Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded for the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period based on estimates of the timing and amount of future loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in periodic earnings.  

Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance contracts were not significant in 2015 or 2013, whereas premiums in 2014 included $3 billion from a single contract with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (LMIC). Under the LMIC agreement, we reinsure substantially all of LMICs unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expense liabilities related to (a) asbestos and environmental claims from policies incepting prior to 2005 and (b) workers compensation claims occurrences arising prior to January 1, 2014, in excess of an aggregate retention of approximately $12.5 billion and subject to an aggregate limit of $6.5 billion.  

Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance policies were $469 million in 2015, $632 million in 2014 and $333 million in 2013. In each year, underwriting losses included deferred charge amortization and foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with foreign currency denominated reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries. In 2015 and 2014, foreign currency exchange rate movements produced decreases in liabilities, generating pre-tax gains of $150 million and $273 million, respectively. Foreign currency gains/losses were not significant in 2013.  

Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results were also impacted during the last two years by increases in the estimated ultimate liabilities for contracts written in prior years, partially offset by increases in related deferred charge balances. The liability increases were approximately $550 million in 2015 and $825 million in 2014. In each year, the ultimate liability increases primarily related to asbestos and environmental exposures. We also re-estimated the timing of future payments of such liabilities as part of our actuarial analysis. The increase in ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $90 million in 2015 and $450 million in 2014.  

Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $23.7 billion at December 31, 2015, $24.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and $17.7 billion at December 31, 2013. Unamortized deferred charges related to BHRGs retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $7.6 billion at December 31, 2015, $7.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $4.25 billion at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, over 80% of unpaid losses and deferred charge balances were concentrated in six contracts.  

Life and annuity  

BHRGs life and annuity underwriting results are summarized as follows (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Periodic payment annuity premiums in 2015 increased 16% compared with 2014, while premiums earned in 2014 declined 22% compared to 2013. Premiums earned in 2015 and 2013 included approximately $425 million and $470 million, respectively, from a single reinsurance contract written in each year. Annuity payments under these contracts are not expected to begin for several years.

Life and annuity (Continued)  

Periodic payment annuity contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $202 million in 2015, $197 million in 2014 and $213 million in 2013. Generally, premiums under these contracts are received at inception and payments are made over time, often extending for decades. No gains or losses are recognized in earnings at the inception of these contracts. Periodic underwriting losses are primarily attributable to the recurring impact of the accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Underwriting results in each year also included pre-tax gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes of $103 million in 2015 and $102 million in 2014 and pre-tax losses of $62 million in 2013. These gains/losses reflected changes in foreign currency denominated liabilities due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. Aggregate annuity liabilities were approximately $8.7 billion at December 31, 2015, $7.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2013.  

In 2015, life reinsurance premiums declined $74 million (5%) compared to 2014. Pre-tax underwriting losses from the life reinsurance business in 2015 were $45 million, which included losses in connection with business that was terminated. In 2013, life reinsurance underwriting results included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million related to an amendment to a reinsurance contract, which resulted in the reversal of premiums earned, which was more than offset by the reversal of life benefits incurred and the release of the liabilities for future losses.  

Our variable annuity business consists of contracts that provide guarantees on closed blocks of variable annuity business written by other insurers. Our initial contract was written in 2013 and produced premiums earned of $1.7 billion. The underwriting gains in each of the past three years reflect the impacts of changes in equity markets and interest rates which generally resulted in decreases in estimated liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. Periodic results from these contracts can be volatile reflecting changes in investment market conditions, which impact the underlying insured exposures.  

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  

The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses. These businesses include: MedPro Group, providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Companys primary group (NICO Primary), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC), providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers compensation; Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BH Specialty), which concentrates on providing large scale insurance solutions for commercial property and casualty risks; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (GUARD), providers of workers compensation and commercial property and casualty insurance coverages to small and mid-sized businesses; and Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and Medicare Supplement insurance.  

Premiums earned in 2015 and 2014 increased by approximately $1.0 billion over the corresponding prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and GUARD. The BH Primary insurers produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting gains of $824 million in 2015, $626 million in 2014 and $385 million in 2013. Combined loss ratios were 57% in 2015 and 60% in 2014 and 2013. Overall, the claim environment over the past three years has been relatively favorable. However, these primary insurers write sizable amounts of liability and workers compensation business, which can have extended claim tails. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience or underwriting results will continue into the future.

InsuranceInvestment Income (Continued)  

Interest earned in 2015 declined $121 million (12%) from 2014, which declined $684 million (40%) from 2013. The reductions reflected the maturities and dispositions of fixed maturity securities with higher interest rates, including $4.4 billion par amount of Wrigley 11.45% subordinated notes as a result of the repurchase of those notes by the issuer in 2013. We also continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances earning very low yields. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such balances.  

Dividend income in 2015 increased $314 million (9%) versus 2014, while dividend income in 2014 exceeded 2013 by $328 million (11%). The increases reflected higher dividend rates for certain of our equity holdings and increased investment levels. Beginning in 2015, dividend income included income from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. 9% Preferred Stock ($3 billion stated value), which was acquired in December 2014.  

Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $88 billion at December 31, 2015, $84 billion at December 31, 2014 and $77 billion at December 31, 2013. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year.  

A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 follows. Other investments include investments in The Dow Chemical Company, Bank of America Corporation and Restaurant Brands International, Inc.

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe)  

Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSFs major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated revenues during 2015 were approximately $22.0 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion (5%), compared to 2014. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 were $6.8 billion, an increase of $606 million (10%) over 2014. Results in 2015 benefitted from significantly improved operating performance compared to substandard service during 2014. Our system velocity and on-time performance improved significantly in 2015. The operational improvements in 2015 reflected the capacity added in 2014 and 2015 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects and additional equipment, other operational initiatives and more favorable winter weather conditions. Our total volume in 2015 was approximately 10.3 million cars/units. During the second half of 2015 and particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced declining demand, especially in coal and certain industrial products categories. If conditions persist, we anticipate that volumes for these categories in 2016 may decline and our revenues and earnings may be lower than in 2015.  

In 2015, the decrease in overall revenues reflected a 6% decline in average revenue per car/unit and a 0.1% decrease in volume. The decrease in average revenue per car/unit in 2015 was attributable to a 55% decline in fuel surcharges ($1.6 billion) versus 2014, primarily due to lower fuel prices. The impact of lower fuel surcharge revenues affected revenues of all product lines.  

In 2015, freight revenues from industrial products decreased 11% from 2014 to $5.6 billion. The decrease reflected lower volumes for petroleum products, frac sand and steel products and lower average revenue per car/unit. With oil at low prices, we expect that volumes in 2016 will weaken compared to 2015. Freight revenues from agricultural products in 2015 increased 2% to approximately $4.2 billion as compared to revenues in 2014. The increase in 2015 was attributable to higher domestic grain shipments and milo exports.  

Freight revenues in 2015 from coal decreased 7% to $4.6 billion compared to 2014. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower average rate per car. Coal volume increased 1% in 2015 primarily due to higher demand in the early part of the year as customers restocked coal inventories. We currently believe that utility coal inventories are relatively high and there is increased usage of other fuel sources in generating electricity. As a result, we expect lower coal volume in 2016.  

Freight revenues from consumer products in 2015 were $6.6 billion, a decline of 6% from 2014. The revenue decline reflected lower average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. In the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a decline in international intermodal volume attributable to diversions of freight from U.S. West Coast ports to other import gateways as a result of the port productivity slow-down from port labor disruptions. Over the remainder of 2015, we experienced increased volume, as port productivity improvements allowed the backlog to clear, and also from higher demand.

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) (Continued)  

Operating expenses in 2015 were $14.3 billion, a decrease of $2 billion (12%) compared to 2014. In 2015, the ratio of operating expenses to revenues declined 4.9 percentage points to 64.9% as compared to 2014. Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively flat versus 2014. In response to weakening customer demand in the latter half of 2015, employment levels were reduced. Fuel expenses in 2015 declined $1.8 billion (41%) compared to 2014, reflecting significantly lower average fuel prices, improved efficiency and lower gross ton miles volume. In 2015, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $122 million (6%) compared to 2014 as a result of lower capitalized software amortization expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation expense attributable to increased levels of railroad assets in service.  

Interest expense in 2015 was $928 million, an increase of $95 million (11%) compared to 2014. Interest expense in 2014 was $833 million, an increase of $104 million (14%) compared to 2013. BNSF funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. In each period, the increased interest expense resulted from higher average outstanding debt.  

Consolidated revenues in 2014 were approximately $23.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.2 billion (5.6%) over 2013. The overall increase in revenues reflected a 1.8% increase in cars/units handled and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit. In 2014, our combined volume was approximately 10.3 million cars/units.  

Our rail operations were negatively affected by severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, particularly in the Northern U.S. service territory, and from various other service issues throughout 2014. These issues resulted in slower average speeds on our system and negatively impacted volumes and revenues of each of our business groups. We experienced improvement in operating performance and freight volumes over the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Revenues from consumer products in 2014 were $7.0 billion, and were relatively unchanged from 2013. In 2014, unit volume and average revenues per car were relatively flat versus 2013. In 2014, our international intermodal business volume was negatively affected by congestion at U.S. West Coast ports. In 2014, revenues from industrial products increased $508 million (9%) to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases in overall unit volume, and to a lesser extent, changes in rates and product mix. Revenues from agricultural products in 2014 increased $584 million (16%) to approximately $4.2 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to increased volume, rates and product mix changes. Also, agricultural products volume in 2013 was negatively affected by the drought conditions in 2012. In 2014, coal revenues of $5.0 billion were essentially unchanged from 2013, as a 2% increase in year-to-date unit volume was offset by a 2% decline in average rates.  

Operating expenses in 2014 were $16.2 billion, an increase of $880 million (6%) over 2013. A significant portion of this increase was due to increased costs related to severe weather issues and service-related challenges. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $372 million (8%) in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased employment levels, and to a lesser extent, wage inflation and higher overtime. Fuel expenses were relatively unchanged compared to 2013. The favorable impact from lower average fuel prices was largely offset by higher volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $150 million (8%) as a result of additional assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $209 million (12%) compared to 2013 as a result of higher crew transportation and other travel costs, and increased costs of utilities.  

Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company)  

We hold an 89.9% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE), which operates an international energy business. BHEs domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC), and NV Energy, which was acquired in December 2013. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE acquired AltaLink, L.P. (AltaLink), a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada, on December 1, 2014. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In addition, BHE operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest franchise networks in the United States.

Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued)  

The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

PacifiCorp  

PacifiCorp operates a regulated utility business in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Revenues in 2015 declined $36 million (1%) compared to 2014. In 2015, wholesale and other revenues declined $129 million, principally due to lower wholesale prices and volumes and lower renewable energy credit revenue, while retail revenues increased compared to 2014, reflecting higher average rates partially offset by slightly lower loads.  

In 2015, EBIT increased $16 million (2%) compared to 2014. In 2015, gross margins (operating revenues less cost of sales) increased $109 million versus 2014, as energy costs declined more than revenues. In 2015, the increase in gross margins was substantially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense ($35 million) due to increased plant-in-service, lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($18 million) and the impact of the recognition in 2014 of expected insurance recoveries on fire losses.  

Revenues in 2014 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $100 million (2%) compared to revenues in 2013. In 2014, revenues increased primarily due to higher retail rates and wholesale prices, partially offset by lower retail customer load. EBIT were $1.0 billion, an increase of $28 million (3%) over 2013. The increase in EBIT reflected the impact of the increase in operating revenues and the recognition of estimated insurance recoveries from a fire loss in 2014 (as compared to a reduction in 2013 EBIT from charges related to the fire), partially offset by increased energy costs and higher depreciation expense. The increase in depreciation expense reflected the impact of changes in depreciation rates and higher plant-in-service, including a new generation facility.  

MidAmerican Energy Company  

MEC operates a regulated utility business primarily in Iowa and Illinois. In 2015, MECs revenues declined $359 million (9%) from 2014. In 2015 regulated natural gas revenues declined $335 million, which was primarily attributable to lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is substantially offset in lower cost of sales. Regulated electric revenues in 2015 increased slightly over 2014, primarily due to higher retail rates in Iowa and higher loads, partially offset by lower average wholesale prices. The increases in Iowa regulated electric rates are attributable to higher retail rates and changes in rate structure approved in August 2014, which results in a greater differential between higher rates from June to September and lower rates in the remaining months.

Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued)  

MidAmerican Energy Company (Continued)  

MECs EBIT in 2015 increased $16 million (5%) compared to 2014, reflecting an increase in gross margins ($97 million), partially offset by increases in depreciation expense from new wind generation and other plant-in-service ($56 million), interest expense ($17 million), and lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($19 million). The increase in gross margins derived primarily from the regulated electric business, which benefitted from the aforementioned changes in Iowa rates and rate structure and lower fuel and purchased power costs.  

Revenues in 2014 increased $365 million (11%) to $3.8 billion, reflecting increases from regulated natural gas ($172 million), regulated electric ($55 million) and nonregulated revenues ($122 million). The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was driven by higher per-unit natural gas costs, which are recovered from customers via adjustment clauses, and higher volume. The increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to increased retail rates. The increase in nonregulated revenues was due to higher natural gas and electricity prices and higher electricity volumes, partly offset by lower natural gas volumes. EBIT were $298 million in 2014, an increase of $68 million (30%) compared to 2013. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to increased earnings from the regulated electric business, reflecting the impact of higher revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense due to the impact of depreciation rate changes, partially offset by increased energy and operating costs.  

NV Energy  

BHE acquired NV Energy on December 19, 2013, and its results are included in our consolidated results beginning as of that date. NV Energy operates electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues and EBIT in 2015 were $3.4 billion and $586 million, respectively, representing increases of $103 million (3%) and $37 million (7%), respectively, over 2014. The increase in revenues was due primarily to higher retail electric revenues reflecting increased customers and higher loads. The increase in EBIT was attributable to an increase in gross margins ($82 million) and lower interest expense ($22 million), partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization ($31 million) and higher other operating expenses, including increased energy efficiency costs. For the December 19 through December 31, 2013 period, NV Energys results reflected one-time customer refunds, acquisition costs and other charges arising from the acquisition.  

Northern Powergrid  

Revenues in 2015 declined $143 million (11%) versus 2014, reflecting the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar ($90 million) and comparatively lower distribution revenues. The decline in distribution revenues reflected lower rates due mainly to the new price control period effective April 1, 2015. In 2015, EBIT declined $67 million (13%) compared to 2014, reflecting the adverse effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar and lower distribution revenues partially offset by lower interest expense ($13 million).  

Revenues in 2014 increased $258 million (25%) and EBIT increased $165 million (46%) as compared to 2013. The increases were due mainly to increased distribution revenues in 2014 from increased rates and favorable regulatory provisions and from the impact of the weaker U.S. Dollar.  

Natural Gas Pipelines  

Revenues in 2015 declined $75 million (7%) versus 2014, which was primarily due to lower gas sales as a result of reduced system and operational balancing activities, partially offset by higher transportation revenues. In 2015, EBIT increased $22 million (6%) as compared to 2014, as decreased costs of gas sold and lower operating expenses more than offset the decline in revenues.  

Revenues in 2014 increased $122 million (13%) compared to 2013. The increase reflected comparatively higher natural gas rates and volumes as a result of significantly colder weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014 in one of our pipeline companys service territory and system rebalancing activities. EBIT in 2014 of $379 million were relatively unchanged from 2013, as the impact of higher revenues was offset by increased costs of gas sold, and higher system inspection, testing and maintenance costs.  

Other energy businesses  

Revenues of other energy businesses in 2015 increased $752 million (113%) over revenues in 2014, while EBIT increased $136 million (58%) versus 2014. Revenues and EBIT in 2015 reflect the acquisition of AltaLink on December 1, 2014. AltaLinks revenues and EBIT in 2015 were $621 million and $170 million, respectively. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in solar capacity placed in service. Excluding the acquisition of AltaLink, the impact of higher revenues in 2015 was more than offset by higher operating, depreciation and interest expenses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued)  

Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued)  

Other energy businesses (Continued)  

Revenues and EBIT in 2014 from other energy businesses increased $372 million and $174 million, respectively, over revenues and EBIT in 2013. The increases were primarily attributable to increased revenues from new solar facilities as additional assets were placed in service and the acquisition of AltaLink on December 1, 2014.  

Real estate brokerage  

Real estate brokerage revenues and EBIT in 2015 increased 17% and 37%, respectively, compared to 2014. The revenue increase reflected comparative increases in closed transactions and average home prices and the impact of business acquisitions. The increase in EBIT in 2015 was primarily due to the increased revenues, net of commission expense, as well as a lower operating expense to revenue ratio as compared to 2014.  

Revenues of the real estate brokerage businesses increased $339 million (19%) in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase reflected the impact of revenues from acquired businesses, partially offset by lower revenues from existing operations, due to a 6% decline in closed units and lower franchise revenues. EBIT of $139 million in 2014 were unchanged from 2013 as the increase in EBIT from acquired businesses was offset by lower EBIT from existing businesses and higher operating expenses.  

Corporate interest and income taxes  

Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE. In 2015 and 2014, corporate interest expense increased over the corresponding prior year due to new borrowings in connection with the NV Energy and AltaLink acquisitions.  

BHEs consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 16% in 2015, 23% in 2014 and 7% in 2013. In each year, BHEs income tax rates reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation in the United States. BHEs effective rates in 2015 and 2013 included the impact of reductions in deferred income tax liabilities as a result of enacted statutory income tax rate decreases in the United Kingdom and increased deferred state income tax benefits.  

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing  

A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Manufacturing  

Our manufacturing group includes a variety of businesses that produce industrial, building and consumer products. Our industrial products businesses include specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon and Scott Fetzer). Our building products businesses include flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Our

Manufacturing (Continued)  

 consumer products businesses include leisure vehicles (Forest River), six apparel and footwear operations (led by Fruit of the Loom, which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel), custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Aggregate revenues of our manufacturers were $36.1 billion in 2015, a decline of $637 million (2%) from 2014. Pre-tax earnings from manufacturing activities were $4.9 billion in 2015, an increase of $82 million (2%) versus 2014. In 2015, operating results of our industrial products and consumer products businesses were generally lower than earnings in 2014. Earnings of our building products businesses were higher than in 2014.  

Industrial products  

Revenues in 2015 of our industrial products manufacturers declined $862 million (5%) versus 2014. The foreign currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar produced $782 million of the comparative revenue decline. In addition, commodity cost deflation in petroleum and metals used in certain of our products resulted in lower average selling prices, in particular for specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, copper wire and plumbing products. Certain of our businesses experienced slowing customer demand over the last half of the year as the decline in oil prices and competitive pressures resulted in significantly lower sales volumes to customers in or related to the oil and gas industry. The negative effect of foreign currency translation and lower selling prices in 2015 was partially offset by the impact of bolt-on acquisitions by Lubrizol ($433 million).  

Pre-tax earnings in 2015 of these businesses declined $165 million (5%) compared to 2014. The average pre-tax margin rate was 17.9% in 2015 and 2014. The comparative declines in earnings in 2015 reflected the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by earnings from bolt-on acquisitions, lower average commodity-based material costs, and actions taken in response to the slowing sales volumes previously referenced. Such actions address cost structures and exiting lower margin business. Our businesses expect soft market conditions in 2016 and expect to take additional actions as necessary, in response to further slowdowns in customer demand.  

Revenues in 2014 increased approximately $1.6 billion (10%) in comparison to 2013. The increase in revenues reflected the impact of bolt-on acquisitions by Lubrizol and Marmon (approximately $1.3 billion). In 2014, we also experienced revenue growth in several business markets, most notably for the metal cutting tools and at certain Marmon business units (commercial trailer and aftermarket brake drum products and water treatment systems). These increases were substantially offset by revenue declines from certain other Marmon business units due to lower copper prices and lower volumes in the electrical and plumbing products.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $382 million (14%) over 2013 and average pre-tax margins were 17.9% in 2014 and 17.3% in 2013. The increase in earnings in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of bolt-on acquisitions ($213 million), increased sales and cost savings and restructuring initiatives.  

Building products  

Revenues in 2015 of our building products manufacturers increased $192 million (2%) over 2014. In 2015, the revenue increase reflected sales volume increases at Shaw, Johns Manville and MiTek, as well as the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions. These revenue increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar ($165 million). Pre-tax earnings increased $271 million (30%) compared to 2014. The overall increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in revenues and lower average raw material and energy costs, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and increased restructuring charges. Most of the comparative increases in earnings were generated by Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore.

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  

Building products (Continued)  

Revenues in 2014 were approximately $10.1 billion, an increase of 5% over 2013. Johns Manville, Acme and MiTek produced revenue increases, which were primarily due to higher sales volume, as well as from the impact of bolt-on acquisitions ($150 million). Shaws revenues in 2014 were relatively unchanged from 2013, reflecting the impact of the closure of the rugs division in early 2014 and lower carpet sales, offset by higher sales of hard surface flooring products. Pre-tax earnings of the building products businesses increased 6% in 2014 as compared to 2013. With the exception of Shaw, our building products businesses generated increased earnings compared to 2013. Shaws earnings were lower due to comparatively higher raw material costs.  

Consumer products  

Revenues of our consumer products manufacturers were approximately $9.1 billion in 2015, relatively unchanged from 2014. In 2015, Forest Rivers revenues increased $217 million (6%) over 2014, due to a 4% increase in unit sales and increased average prices. Apparel revenues declined $157 million (4%) compared to 2014. In 2015, the decline in apparel revenues was attributable to generally lower sales volumes compared to 2014 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation as a result of a stronger U.S. Dollar ($113 million).  

Pre-tax earnings declined $24 million in 2015 (3%) compared to 2014. The decline was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2015 from the disposition of an unprofitable operation within Fruit of the Loom and lower earnings from our footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River.  

Revenues were $9.0 billion in 2014, an increase of $474 million (6%) compared to 2013. The increase was driven by a 14% increase in Forest Rivers revenues due to increased unit sales. Pre-tax earnings were $756 million in 2014, an increase of $174 million (30%) compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from apparel businesses, and to a lesser extent, Forest River. Operating results of our apparel businesses benefitted from restructuring initiatives undertaken beginning in 2013, which included discontinuing unprofitable business, as well as from comparatively lower manufacturing and pension costs. The increase in Forest Rivers earnings reflected the aforementioned increase in unit sales and lower unit manufacturing costs.  

Service and retailing  

Our service and retailing businesses are comprised of a large group of independently managed businesses engaged in a variety of activities. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service  

Our service businesses offer fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and provide electronic distribution services of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire). We franchise and service quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and publish newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group). In June 2014, we acquired a television station operating in Miami, Florida (WPLG) and in December 2014, we acquired a third party logistics services business that primarily serves the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage).  

Revenues in 2015 increased $347 million (3.5%) as compared to 2014. The increase in revenues included a 5% increase in NetJets revenues and the impact of the acquisitions of Charter Brokerage and WPLG, partly offset by lower revenues from our newspapers. The increase in NetJets revenues was attributable to a 50% increase in aircraft sales, partially offset by lower operations revenue due primarily to lower fuel cost recoveries ($189 million) and unfavorable foreign currency effects ($105 million).

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  

Service (Continued)  

Pre-tax earnings in 2015 declined $46 million compared to 2014. Earnings in 2015 were favorably impacted by the WPLG and Charter Brokerage acquisitions, which were more than offset by lower earnings from NetJets. Earnings declined at NetJets as the impact of increased aircraft sales margins was more than offset by increased personnel, aircraft subcontracting and maintenance expenses. A portion of the increase in personnel costs pertained to lump-sum payments made in connection with a collective bargaining agreement reached with our pilots in the fourth quarter.  

Revenues in 2014 increased $858 million (9.5%) over 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to comparative increases generated by NetJets, FlightSafety and TTI. The revenue increase at NetJets reflected increased flight hours as well as increased fractional aircraft sales. The revenue increase at TTI was driven by higher unit volume and, to a lesser extent, by bolt-on acquisitions. The revenue increase at FlightSafety was primarily due to increased simulator training hours.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $109 million (10%) versus 2013, and was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in revenues. In addition, NetJets business benefitted from comparatively lower aircraft impairment and restructuring charges and financing expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, maintenance costs and subcontracted flight expenses.  

Retailing  

Our retailing businesses include four distinct home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. In the first quarter of 2015, we acquired The Van Tuyl Group (now named Berkshire Hathaway Automotive or BHA) which included 81 auto dealerships located in 10 states. BHA sells new and pre-owned automobiles and offers repair and other related services and products, and includes two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a distributor of automotive fluid maintenance products.  

Our other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), Sees Candies, which makes and sells confectionary products through its retail stores and quantity order centers, Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools and Oriental Trading Company, a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties. On April 30, 2015, we also acquired Detlev Louis Motorrad (Louis), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany.  

Revenues of our retailing businesses in 2015 increased approximately $8.8 billion as compared to 2014. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions, which contributed revenues of approximately $8.3 billion. Revenues of our home furnishings retailers in 2015 increased $572 million (24%) over 2014, driven by Nebraska Furniture Mart, which opened a new store in March of 2015, and from increases at R.C. Willey and Jordans. Retailing earnings increased $220 million in 2015 (64%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions.  

Revenues in 2014 increased $134 million (3%), while pre-tax earnings declined $32 million (8.5%) compared to 2013. The earnings decline in 2014 was primarily attributable to lower earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart, due primarily to start-up costs related to its new store, and Pampered Chef, due to a decline in sales.  

McLane Company  

McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (grocery unit) and to restaurants (foodservice unit). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (beverage unit). The grocery and foodservice units are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have a significant adverse impact on McLanes periodic revenues and earnings.  

Revenues in 2015 increased $1.6 billion (3%) over 2014, reflecting revenue increases in the foodservice unit (6%), beverage unit (8%) and grocery unit (2%). Pre-tax earnings in 2015 increased $67 million (15%) versus 2014. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 included a gain of $19 million from the sale of a subsidiary and otherwise benefitted from lower fuel and trucking costs.

McLane Company (Continued)  

Revenues in 2014 increased $710 million (1.5%) compared to 2013, primarily due to revenue increases in the foodservice unit (7%) and beverage unit (11%). Pre-tax earnings in 2014 declined $51 million (10.5%) from 2013. Earnings in 2013 included a pre-tax gain of $24 million from the sale of a logistics business. Before the impact of this gain, earnings decreased 6% compared to 2013. The decline reflected slightly higher earnings from the grocery unit and beverage unit, which were more than offset by lower earnings from the foodservice unit. In 2014, our foodservice unit experienced higher processing costs and higher other operating costs which more than offset the increase in revenues.

Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, transportation equipment leasing), as well as other leasing and financing activities. UTLX manufactures, owns and leases railcars and intermodal tank cars, and also owns and leases cranes, while XTRA owns and leases over-the-road trailers. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Manufactured housing and finance  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2015 increased $266 million (8%) and $148 million (27%), respectively, compared to 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in home unit sales. The increase in earnings was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings, improved manufacturing results and relatively low delinquency rates and lower loss rates on loan foreclosures. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower average balances. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 95% of the installment loan portfolio was current in terms of payment status.  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 increased $111 million (3%) and $142 million (34%), respectively, compared to revenues and earnings in 2013. The increase in revenues was principally due to a 7% increase in homes sold over 2013. Earnings continued to benefit from lower loan loss provisions on installment loan portfolios, lower interest expense on borrowings and improved manufacturing results. The decline in loan loss provisions reflected fewer delinquencies and foreclosures, while the decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower rates.  

Transportation equipment leasing  

Transportation equipment leasing revenues in 2015 increased 5% compared to 2014. The increase reflected increased rail car lease rates, a larger fleet of rail/tank cars, higher volumes in our Australian crane business, increased over-the-road trailers on lease and gains on dispositions of trailers. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange effects attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower volumes in our North American crane leasing business due to declines in oil drilling activity. On September 30, 2015, UTLX acquired approximately 25,000 tank cars from General Electric Companys leasing unit for a total purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion. On December 31, 2015, UTLX also completed the acquisition of several railcar repair and maintenance facilities, which will further enhance its full-service leasing, repair and maintenance network.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2015 increased $82 million (10%) over 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the revenue growth discussed above, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and higher railcar repair and warranty costs and depreciation expense attributable to a larger fleet size. A significant portion of the transportation leasing business costs such as depreciation, do not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings.

Transportation equipment leasing (Continued)  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2014 from our transportation equipment leasing businesses were $2.4 billion and $827 million, respectively, which exceeded revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 by 11% and 17%, respectively. The earnings increase reflected a 9% increase in aggregate lease revenues, primarily due to increased units on lease and higher lease rates for railcars.  

Other  

Other earnings from finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business (Berkadia) in which we own a 50% joint venture interest, and interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments. In 2015, the increase in other earnings compared to 2014 reflected increased earnings from investment securities and CORT, partially offset by lower earnings from Berkadia. In addition, other earnings includes income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund installment loans made by Clayton Homes and debt guarantee fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes and NetJets results. Guarantee fees and interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes and NetJets were $63 million in 2015, $70 million in 2014, and $89 million in 2013.  

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses  

A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment gains/losses  

Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption or exchange of investments or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  

We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although we do not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in earnings.  

Pre-tax investment gains in 2015 included non-cash holding gains related to our investment in Kraft Heinz of $6.8 billion, as well as net gains from dispositions of equity and fixed maturity securities of approximately $2.5 billion. In connection with its acquisition of Kraft Foods on July 2, 2015, Kraft Heinz issued new shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of Kraft Foods common stock, thus reducing Berkshires ownership interest in Kraft Heinz by approximately 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, such transactions are treated by the investor as if it sold a portion of its interests. For additional information see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Pre-tax investment gains in 2014 were $4.3 billion, which included gains of approximately $2.1 billion realized in connection with the exchanges of common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company for 100% of the common stock of a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Each exchange transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the businesses received over the tax-basis of the common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company exchanged.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

Investment gains/losses (Continued)  

Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2013 were $4.3 billion and included approximately $2.1 billion related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants and Wrigley subordinated notes. Beginning in 2013, the unrealized gains or losses associated with the warrants were included in earnings. These warrants were exercised in October 2013 on a cashless basis in exchange for shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 billion. The Wrigley subordinated notes were repurchased for cash of $5.08 billion, resulting in a pre-tax investment gain of $680 million.  

Other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI)  

OTTI charges in 2015 were not significant and in 2014 were $697 million, which predominantly related to our investments in equity securities of Tesco PLC. OTTI charges in 2013 related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings bonds. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date OTTI charges are recorded in earnings, the increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI charges does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, consolidated gross unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were approximately $3.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2015, these unrealized losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline.  

Derivative gains/losses  

Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets.  

In 2015, equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of approximately $1.0 billion, which were primarily attributable to the impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar and shorter remaining durations. As of December 31, 2015, the intrinsic value of these contracts was approximately $1.1 billion and the fair value of our recorded liabilities was approximately $3.55 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value, as defined under the contracts. We have made no loss payments to date.  

Our remaining credit default contract produced a pre-tax loss in 2015 of $34 million. The loss represents an increase in the estimated fair value of our recorded liabilities during the period, reflecting changes in credit spreads, interest rates and remaining durations of the underlying exposures. There were no loss payments over the three years ending December 31, 2015.  

In 2014, derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of $506 million. The change in the fair value of our credit default contract during 2014 produced a pre-tax gain of $397 million, and was attributable to lower credit spreads. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $108 million in 2014. Such gains reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and generally higher index values, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest rate assumptions.  

In 2013, derivative contracts generated pre-tax gains of $2.6 billion, including gains of $2.8 billion from equity index put option contracts and a loss of $213 million from our credit default contract. The gains from equity index put option contracts were due to changes in fair values of the contracts as a result of overall higher equity index values, favorable currency movements and modestly higher interest rate assumptions. The credit default contract loss was primarily attributable to wider credit spreads.

Other  

Other earnings includes corporate income (including income from our investments in Kraft Heinz) and expenses and income taxes not allocated to operating businesses. Our investments in Kraft Heinz generated earnings before allocated corporate taxes of $730 million in 2015, $694 million in 2014 and $146 million in 2013, which included significant dividends received on our Preferred Stock investment and equity method earnings on our common stock investment. Also included in other earnings are amortization of fair value adjustments made in connection with several prior business acquisitions (primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets) and corporate interest expense. These two charges (after-tax) aggregated $708 million in 2015, $682 million in 2014 and $514 million in 2013.  

Financial Condition  

Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2015 was $255.6 billion, an increase of $15.4 billion since December 31, 2014. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2015 were $24.1 billion, which was partially offset by approximately $8.8 billion of net losses in other comprehensive income primarily related to changes in unrealized investment appreciation and the impact of foreign currency translation.  

At December 31, 2015, insurance and other businesses held cash and cash equivalents of $61.2 billion, and investments (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz) of $152.2 billion. We used cash of approximately $4.9 billion in 2015 to fund business acquisitions. On July 1, 2015, Berkshire used cash of approximately $5.3 billion to acquire additional shares of Kraft Heinz common stock.  

In 2015, Berkshire Hathaway parent company issued 3.0 billion in senior unsecured notes consisting of 750 million of 0.75% senior notes due in 2023, 1.25 billion of 1.125% senior notes due in 2027 and 1.0 billion of 1.625% senior notes due in 2035. During 2015, parent company senior notes of $1.7 billion matured and were repaid. Over the next twelve months, $1.05 billion of parent company senior notes will mature, including $300 million that matured in February 2016. Our various insurance and non-insurance businesses continued to generate significant cash flows from operations.  

On January 29, 2016 we completed our acquisition of Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC). At that time, we acquired all outstanding PCC shares of common stock, other than the shares already owned (about 2.7 million shares or 1.96%), for aggregate consideration of approximately $32 billion. We funded the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and $10 billion borrowed under a new 364-day revolving credit agreement. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently expect to issue new term debt in 2016 and use the proceeds to repay the revolving credit loan.  

Berkshires Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at managements discretion and there is no obligation to repurchase any shares. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshires consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program in 2015.  

Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2015, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were approximately $11.6 billion, including $5.9 billion by BHE and $5.7 billion by BNSF. BNSF and BHE forecast additional aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $8.7 billion in 2016. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances.

Financial Condition (Continued)  

In 2015, BNSF issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured debentures, consisting of $850 million of debentures due in 2025 and $1.65 billion of debentures due in 2045. In 2015, BNSF also issued $500 million of amortizing debt with a final maturity date of 2028, which is secured with locomotives. BNSFs outstanding debt was approximately $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion from December 31, 2014. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries, excluding borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, were approximately $36.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2014. In 2015, BHE issued debt of approximately $2.5 billion which was substantially offset by debt repayments and the effect of the stronger U.S. Dollar on its non-dollar denominated debt. BNSF and BHE aggregate debt and capital lease obligations maturing within the next twelve months are $2.5 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BHE or BNSF or any of their subsidiaries.  

Finance and financial products assets were approximately $39.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $5.5 billion since December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Finance assets also include loans and finance receivables, equity securities and various types of equipment and furniture held for lease, including tank cars acquired from General Electric Companys leasing unit on September 30, 2015 for approximately $1.0 billion.  

Finance and financial products liabilities were approximately $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2014. The reduction in liabilities during 2015 was primarily attributable to a reduction in liabilities of derivative contracts and notes payable and other borrowings. Notes payable and other borrowings were approximately $11.95 billion as of December 31, 2015, a decline of $779 million compared to year-end 2014. As of December 31, 2015, notes payable included $10.7 billion of senior notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC). In 2015, $1.5 billion of BHFC debt matured and BHFC issued $1.0 billion of new floating rate senior notes of which $400 million mature in 2017 and $600 million mature in 2018. An additional $1.0 billion of BHFC senior notes mature within the next twelve months. The proceeds from the BHFC senior notes are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes. We currently intend to issue additional notes in 2016 through BHFC to fund a portion of assets held for lease of our rail tank car business, UTLX Company. The amount of debt to be issued and related maturities will be determined based on prevailing market conditions.  

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act) was signed into law. The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized during the next several months. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.  

Contractual Obligations  

We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred were not included in the following table to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.  

The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future claim settlement activities or events. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. These amounts are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded under reinsurance contracts, receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table.

Critical Accounting Policies  

Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances.  

Property and casualty losses  

A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed.  

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Except for certain workers compensation claims, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing these liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. We utilize processes and techniques that are believed to best suit the underlying claims and available data.  

As of any balance sheet date, recorded liabilities include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement or payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

Reinsurance receivables are recorded for losses recoverable from third parties and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. Reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.  

GEICO  

GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2015 were $13.7 billion compared to $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2014.  

GEICOs claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yield an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity).  

We establish and evaluate unpaid loss liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant components of recorded liabilities at December 31, 2015 included $9.7 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $4.0 billion of IBNR reserves. Our recorded liabilities are affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. We use statistical techniques to analyze historical claims data and adjust when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. We analyze claims data a number of ways, including by rated state, reporting date and occurrence date.  

We establish average reserves for reported new auto damage and liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. Average reserves represent our estimated liabilities for claims when our adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of relatively minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Aggregate average reserves are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.  

We generally establish individual liability claim case loss reserve estimates once the facts and merits of each claim are evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised over time as information becomes available.  

Approximately 92% of GEICOs claim liabilities as of December 31, 2015 related to automobile liability coverages, of which bodily injury (BI) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. Liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as BI, uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation, and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is first established. Case reserves alone insufficiently measure the ultimate claim cost, so we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserves. As of December 31, 2015, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of the case reserves. Case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves and are reviewed and revised periodically.  

For unreported claims, IBNR reserves are estimated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are deducted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of estimated unreported claims is then multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as new or changing legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, we may establish supplemental IBNR reserves in these situations.  

For significant coverages, we test the adequacy of the aggregate liabilities for unpaid losses using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.  

Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimates recorded at the end of 2014 developed downward by $147 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2015. The downward revisions produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2015, which was approximately 0.7% of earned premiums and 1.3% of prior year-end recorded net liabilities. In 2014, estimated liabilities for pre-2014 occurrences developed downward $386 million or 3.6% of net liabilities at December 31, 2013. Assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2015 were modified as appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

GEICO (Continued)  

We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2015. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $205 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.  

GEICOs exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposures are currently an immaterial component of GEICOs aggregate reserves (approximately 1.0%).  

General Re and BHRG  

Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of General Re and BHRG derive primarily from reinsurance contracts. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies.  

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract, if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Loss information may be reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports, which may include currently recoverable losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.  

The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed compared to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby creating multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reasons.  

Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data reported to us is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, BHRG and General Re are contractually permitted to access the ceding companys books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the accuracy and completeness of the reported information.  

In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

General Re  

General Res gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Net of discounts of $1,579 million.

General Res loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case loss estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of incurred losses reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns by actuarial personnel. Recorded liabilities are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the expected loss emergence time period.  

We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed to render meaningful estimates of such ranges.  

Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, we independently evaluate loss amounts. In some cases, our estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If our estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, we establish ACRs above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2015, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.4 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. We also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves may be increased as a result.  

We classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers compensation) and jurisdiction. For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. Globally, we review approximately 1,200 reserve cells.  

We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence and development patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident, policy or underwriting year, we calculate IBNR reserves. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we may use loss emergence estimation formulae along with other loss triangles and actuarial judgment to determine loss emergence patterns. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims practices; our use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends, and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.  

We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell and by accident, policy or underwriting year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratios and forecasted losses obtained from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premiums. If the selected loss emergence pattern proves to be unreasonable, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may be unreasonable, which can then impact the selected loss ratios and the IBNR reserve. Judgment is necessary in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and pricing statistics.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re (Continued)  

We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year, based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.  

During 2015 and 2014, we reduced net losses for prior years occurrences by $410 million. These reductions produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings in each year.  

In 2015, reported claims for prior years workers compensation losses were $178 million less than expected. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves, which precipitated an increase of $78 million in nominal IBNR reserve. After adjusting for changes in reserve discounts, the net increase in workers compensation losses from prior years occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $844 million and $487 million on a discounted basis at December 31, 2015. An increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.  

Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed favorably in 2015 relative to expectations. However, casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year will continue in the future. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells, we estimate that an increase of five points in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reinsurance reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.1 billion. This amount includes changes in assumptions used in certain U.K. motor annuity claims liabilities. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $1.1 billion.  

In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected loss emergence patterns. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of five points in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern (for those cells where loss emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of five percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $72 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.  

Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Mass tort net claims paid in 2015 were $83 million and we increased ultimate loss estimates for such claims by $87 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios based on average net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 15.1 years as of December 31, 2015 and 14.9 years as of December 31, 2014. The reinsurance industrys survival ratio for asbestos and pollution liabilities was approximately 14.0 years as of December 31, 2014.  

In 2015, reported claims for prior years property loss events were less than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $260 million. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses.

BHRG  

BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In general, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.  

A large percentage of BHRGs aggregate reserves derive from retroactive reinsurance contracts. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to such contracts were approximately $23.7 billion at December 31, 2015, and were predominately for casualty or liability coverages. Retroactive reinsurance policies relate to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date and include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified and contracts that indemnify losses paid by the counterparty immediately after the policy effective date. These contracts may include significant exposures to asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims.  

The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to our retroactive policies. We review and establish loss reserve estimates in the aggregate by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends.  

In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process.  

BHRGs liabilities under retroactive reinsurance include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses of approximately $12.4 billion at December 31, 2015. We do not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims data from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates are developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on the ultimate liabilities for mass tort claims.  

We increased ultimate liabilities for prior years retroactive reinsurance contracts by approximately $550 million in 2015. The increases primarily related to asbestos and environmental risks assumed. The increase, net of deferred charge balances adjustments related to changes in estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid liabilities, produced charges to pre-tax earnings of approximately $90 million. We paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.2 billion in 2015 with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.  

We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed approximately $40 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that our reported year end 2015 gross unpaid losses of $23.7 billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities related to property and casualty contracts, other than retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and consisted of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties, and to a lesser extent, under individual risk contracts. These coverages included catastrophe and aviation contracts that periodically generate low frequency/high severity losses. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.  

Under most of our non-catastrophe property and casualty treaties, liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustments expenses are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by managements estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared. For BHRGs property/casualty contracts other than retroactive reinsurance, we decreased estimated ultimate losses for prior years occurrences by approximately $728 million in 2015, which primarily derived from lower than expected losses reported by ceding companies. The decrease produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings.  

Derivative contract liabilities  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options are inherently subjective. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model.  

We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. The interest rates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 63 basis points and 53 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component.  

The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 5 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 21.0%, compared to 20.9% as of December 31, 2014. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract notional value. The volatility input for each contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2015 ($3.6 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For several years, we also wrote a number of credit default contracts involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. At December 31, 2015, our remaining exposures relate to state/municipality exposures which begin to expire in 2019. The fair value of our state/municipality contract is generally based on pricing data and current ratings on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions.

Other Critical Accounting Policies  

We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $7.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Significant changes in the estimated amount and the timing of payments of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $62.7 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.  

Market Risk Disclosures  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.  

Equity Price Risk  

Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2015, approximately 59% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated within four companies.  

We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.  

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.  

We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract.

Equity Price Risk (Continued)  

The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Excludes other investments that do not possess significant equity price risk.  

Interest Rate Risk  

We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks.  

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments.

Interest Rate Risk (Continued)  

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Excludes other investments that are not subject to a significant level of interest rate risk.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies such as The Coca-Cola Company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries, as well as through our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock that is accounted for under the equity method. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.

Commodity Price Risk  

Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at BHE. BHEs exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints.  

To mitigate a portion of the risk, BHE uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. The table that follows summarizes commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of BHE as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.
