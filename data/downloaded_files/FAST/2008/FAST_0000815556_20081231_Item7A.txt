ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS  

We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows:  

 (1) Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008.  

 (2) Commodity Steel Pricing  We buy and sell various types of steel products which consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners. During the last decade, there has been nominal movement in overall product pricing, with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the Far East markets that occurred in the late 1990s. This trend reversed to inflation in late 2003 and early 2004 as well as the later part of 2007 and all of 2008. Fluctuations in pricing of certain commodities like steel can affect our cost structure and pricing. We are exposed to the impact of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers.  

 (3) Commodity Fuel Prices  We have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel; however, this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight cost to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network.
