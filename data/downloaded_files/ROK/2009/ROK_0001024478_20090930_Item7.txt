Technological Advancement and Domain Expertise  

We seek a technology leadership position in all facets of plant-wide control. We believe our core technologies are the foundation for long-term sustainable growth at a multiple of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth.  

Our customers face increasingly complex and volatile customer demand patterns, which are driving the need for flexible manufacturing. Our investments in new technology and domain expertise have expanded our served market beyond discrete control into process, safety and information. Our value proposition is to help our customers gain the benefits of faster time to market, lower total cost of ownership, better asset utilization and reduced business risks.  

We believe that process automation is the largest growth opportunity for our company. Our Logix architecture enables us to compete effectively with traditional Distributed Control Systems (DCS) solutions for many process applications. Our Logix architecture can integrate information across the plant floor to the enterprise systems and the external supply chain. Our Logix architecture continues to be an important differentiator and the anchor of our comprehensive automation offerings.  

We have one of the most comprehensive safety offerings in the industry, including both machine and process safety products and solutions. We see significant potential in the growing safety market. We successfully integrated safety into the Logix platform with our launch of GuardLogix® safety controllers. Our safety products are designed to bring a dual benefit to our customers: a safe environment for their employees and productivity in their operations.  

Through internal investment and acquisitions, we have expanded our capability in the area of plant-wide information. This opportunity involves optimizing processes and assets while integrating between the plant floor, the enterprise business system and the supply chain.  

Our broad power and motor control offering is one of our core competencies. Many of our motor control products are intelligent and configurable. These products enhance the availability, efficiency and safe operation of our customers critical plant assets.  

We augment our product portfolio with solutions and service offerings. We have expanded our portfolio of repeatable solutions, which enables us to gain efficiency, drive innovation and improve the global deployment of our solutions to our customers. The combination of our leading technologies with the industry-specific domain expertise of our people enables us to solve many of our customers manufacturing challenges.  

Global Expansion and Enhanced Market Access  

As the manufacturing world continues to globalize, we must be able to meet our customers needs in emerging markets. We expect to continue to add delivery resources and expand our sales force in emerging markets over the long term. We currently have more than half of our employees outside the U.S., and achieved our goal of about 50 percent of our revenues outside of the U.S. during 2008.  

As we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products, services and solutions that we provide to our customers in these regions. We have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. The emerging markets of Asia Pacific, including China and India, Latin America and middle and eastern Europe have the potential to exceed global GDP rates, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing role of consumer spending in these markets. We believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.  

OEMs represent another growth opportunity. The OEM market is large and we have an opportunity to increase market share within it, particularly outside of North America. To remain competitive, OEMs need to continually improve their costs and machine performance and reduce their time to market. Our modular and scaleable Logix offering, particularly when combined with motion and safety, can assist OEMs in addressing these business needs.  

17   
Industry Views  

We apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges. We serve customers in a wide range of industries, including consumer, resource-based and transportation.  

Our consumer industry customers are engaged in the food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences industries. These customers needs include global expansion, incremental capacity from existing facilities, an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance. In addition, these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors.  

We serve customers in resource-based industries, including oil and gas, mining, aggregates, cement, metals, water/wastewater and forest products. Companies in these industries typically invest when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing.  

In the transportation industry, factors such as geographic expansion, investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers purchasing decisions regarding our products, services and solutions.  

Demand for our products, services and solutions across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. Customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. Our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally. We help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental and safety goals. Higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor controls and energy efficient solutions and services. In addition, environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices.  

Acquisitions  

In March 2009, we bought a majority of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the automation business of Rutter Hinz Inc., which is expected to accelerate our business growth in Canada and in the oil and gas and other resource-based industries. In January 2009, we bought the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Xian Hengsheng Science & Technology Limited. This acquisition advances our globalization strategy and strengthens our ability to deliver project management and engineering solutions primarily to our customers in China.  

During 2008 we acquired CEDES Safety & Automation AG (CEDES), Incuity Software, Inc. (Incuity) and Pavilion Technologies, Inc. (Pavilion). With our acquisition of CEDES, we have expanded our comprehensive machine safety component portfolio. CEDES is a supplier of safety and measuring light curtains, a leading product offering in the machine safety market. Incuity positions us for continued success in the information solutions market. Incuitys enterprise manufacturing intelligence offerings, which we have named FactoryTalk® VantagePoint, enable us to accelerate specific aspects of our plant-wide information strategy and extend the capabilities of our integrated architecture. We believe that Pavilions expertise in advanced process control, production optimization and environmental compliance solutions, paired with our Logix architecture, positions us to help our customers create a more agile, efficient and productive environment. It also benefits, in particular, our process growth initiative.  

We believe the acquired companies will help us expand our market share and deliver value to our customers.  

Continuous Improvement  

Productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. We have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost savings and manufacturing productivity. We are in the process of developing and implementing common global processes and an enterprise-wide information system. These are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investment in growth and technology and to offset inflation. Our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost and improved asset utilization. Charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs.

U. S. Industrial Economic Trends  

In 2009, sales to U.S. customers accounted for 51 percent of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our U.S. served markets include:  

      The Industrial Production Index (Total Index), published by the Federal Reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The Industrial Production Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2002. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the Industrial Production Index and the level of capital investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base.    

      The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.    

      Industrial Equipment Spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy. This measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growth.    

      Capacity Utilization (Total Industry), which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity Utilization and levels of U.S. industrial production.    

The table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2007 to 2009. Recent trends in most metrics show signs of possible stabilization; however, we continue to operate in a period of uncertainty with respect to the U.S. economy.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Note:   Economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations.    

19   
Non-U.S. Regional Trends  

In 2009, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 49 percent of our total sales. Outside the U.S., demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets. These customers include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and indigenous companies. Demand has historically been driven, in part, by:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We use changes in GDP as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business. GDP either declined or grew slowly in all regions during fiscal 2009, contributing to reduced customer demand. We have observed the most significant effects of the GDP deceleration in the developed economies of Canada, Western Europe and Asia Pacific, all of which experienced year-over-year GDP declines. We also saw GDP declines in Latin America, beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2009. GDP growth rates in certain Asia Pacific emerging economies exceeded the global average, as growth in these economies began to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2009. Signs indicating potential stabilization in global economic conditions began to appear in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, but the market outlook in all regions continues to remain uncertain.  

Revenue by Geographic Region  

The table below presents our actual sales for the year ended September 30, 2009 by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended September 30, 2008 (in millions, except percentages):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Summary of Results of Operations  

Our 2009 results reflect the severity of the global economic recession. Market conditions quickly deteriorated across most industries and all regions. Turmoil in the financial markets intensified the economic decline and was a contributing factor in most industrial companies decisions to slow production, reduce spending and conserve cash. All of these factors contributed to 2009 being one of the most challenging years in our history.  

In this economic environment, we experienced a full year organic revenue decline of 19 percent. However, we saw demand levels in our products business start to stabilize in the latter part of the year and our revenue grew sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009. While macroeconomic conditions appear to be stabilizing, the outlook for manufacturing investment remains uncertain. 

During 2009, we acted decisively throughout the year to right-size our cost structure, allowing us to achieve cost savings in 2009 and expected incremental cost savings in 2010. These actions required us to record restructuring charges of $60.4 million ($41.8 million after tax, or $0.29 per diluted share). We carefully balanced these actions with preserving investments in our core technologies and global domain expertise. We also generated significant cash flow this year by quickly aligning inventory levels to lower demand, effectively managing receivables in a difficult credit environment and appropriately constraining capital spending. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong.  

We will continue our operating discipline, with a focus on cost control and cash management, into 2010. We believe our ongoing commitment to innovation, technology differentiation, domain expertise and thought leadership will enable us to continue to meet our customers global productivity and sustainability needs.  

The following tables reflect our sales and operating results for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions, except per share amounts):

21   
2009 Compared to 2008  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales  

Sales decreased 24 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The effects of currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease. We experienced a significant decline in customer demand during 2009 due to deteriorating economic, financial and credit market conditions in most regions and industries. Sales to customers in the United States declined 22 percent organically as compared to 2008, as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries. The Canadian organic sales decline of 28 percent compared to 2008 was driven by weakness in all industrial sectors, including transportation and general manufacturing. Sales to customers in EMEA declined 19 percent organically compared to 2008. EMEA weakness occurred in all industries as well as in sales to OEMs, due to a large number of plant shutdowns and production cutbacks. Organic sales in Asia-Pacific declined by 11 percent compared to 2008. Korea and Japan contributed most to the decline in the region. Organic sales in Latin America declined by 6 percent as compared to 2008. The Latin America region benefited from demand in resource-based industries during the first two quarters of the year, but experienced year-over-year organic sales declines in the second half of the year.  

In 2009 we experienced significant year-over-year declines in all of our end markets, including transportation, metals, and to a lesser extent, consumer products industries. However, the decline in process sales was lower than our average rate of decline.  

Purchase Accounting Depreciation and Amortization  

Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was $18.6 million in 2009 compared to $24.2 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to completed amortization of certain intangible assets and currency translation.  

General Corporate  Net  

General corporate expenses were $80.3 million in 2009 compared to $77.2 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased charitable contributions and a gain recognized in the first nine months of 2008 in connection with the divestiture of Power Systems, partially offset by cost reductions.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense was $60.9 million in 2009 compared to $68.2 million in 2008. The decrease was due to lower interest rates and lower short-term debt balances.  

22   
Income Taxes  

The effective tax rate for 2009 was 20.4 percent compared to 28.6 percent in 2008. The 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower tax rates on income outside the United States and in 2008 we benefited from the use of foreign tax credits.  

The 2009 rate was lower than 2008 because we benefited from a lower proportionate share of income in higher tax rate jurisdictions as compared to 2008. During 2009, we also recognized discrete tax benefits of $20.5 million related to the retroactive extension of the U.S. federal research tax credit, the resolution of a contractual tax obligation and various state tax matters, partially offset by discrete tax expenses of $4.2 million related to a non-U.S. subsidiary.  

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2009 and 2008 affecting the respective tax rates.  

Income from Continuing Operations  

Income from continuing operations decreased 62 percent in 2009 to $217.9 million, compared to 2008. The decrease is primarily due to our significant decline in sales volume. Inflation, the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease. These items were partially offset by cost reductions, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.  

During 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $60.4 million ($41.8 million after tax, or $0.29 per diluted share) related to actions designed to better align our cost structure with current economic conditions. We recorded $35.2 million of the restructuring charges as a reduction of Architecture & Software operating earnings and $25.2 million as a reduction of Control Products & Solutions operating earnings. Special items of $4.0 million in 2009 include the reversal of a portion of restructuring accruals established in prior years.  

During 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $50.7 million ($34.0 million after tax, or $0.23 per diluted share) related to actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. This charge was partially offset by the reversal of $4.0 million ($3.6 million net of tax or $0.02 per diluted share) of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions, as employee attrition differed from our original estimates. We recorded these net charges in special items in 2008.  

See Note 14 in the Financial Statements for more information on restructuring charges and special items.  

Architecture & Software  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales  

Architecture & Software sales decreased 29 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries. Organic sales decreased 24 percent, as the effects of currency translation contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the decline. We experienced year-over-year declines in sales of this segment as a result of the global recession and the short-cycle nature of this segments sales activities. Logix sales declined 17 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, while the decline in sales of our legacy processor products was greater than the segments average rate of decline.  

Operating Margin  

Architecture & Software segment operating margin decreased by 11.3 points to 12.9 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significant declines in sales volume. The unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease, partially offset by cost reductions.  

23   
Control Products & Solutions  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales  

Control Products & Solutions sales decreased 20 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Organic sales decreased 15 percent as the effects of currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease. We experienced significant year-over-year declines in sales by the products businesses of this segment as a result of the global recession and the short-cycle nature of these businesses sales activities. Sales by our solutions and services businesses declined at a lower rate than the segments average rate of decline, as we delivered solutions from our backlog.  

Operating Margin  

Control Products & Solutions segment operating margin decreased by 5.5 points to 7.9 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from significant declines in sales volume. Inflation, the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease, which was partially offset by cost reductions.  

2008 Compared to 2007  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales  

Sales increased 14 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Organic sales increased 6 percent, with effects of currency translation and acquisitions adding 5 and 3 percentage points to the growth rate, respectively. In 2008, we continued the execution of our ongoing globalization strategy and our focus on emerging markets, as approximately 50 percent of our sales during 2008 were to non-U.S. customers. Sales in emerging markets grew at above our average growth rate. We demonstrated improved performance in the Asia-Pacific region, with particular strength in China and India. The growth rate in Asia-Pacific accelerated every quarter during 2008, resulting in a full year organic growth rate of 15 percent compared to 2007. We continued to see strong organic growth in Latin America of 14 percent, benefiting from strength in resource-based industries. Sales to customers in the United States, Canada and EMEA each grew at 4-5 percent organically.  

In 2008, we experienced considerable growth in our key process and OEM growth initiatives, demonstrating the ongoing diversification of our revenue base. We achieved above average growth in resource-based industries, primarily due to higher commodity prices, infrastructure spending and continued demand for oil, gas and other resources, particularly in emerging markets. Sales to global automotive customers grew at about our average growth rate, but U.S. automotive growth was below our average growth rate. Sales to customers in the life sciences industries were significantly below our average growth rate. Our sales growth in the food and beverage and home and personal care industries was also below our average growth rate; however, these industries tend to provide for more consistent rates of growth over time.  

Purchase Accounting Depreciation and Amortization  

Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was $24.2 million in 2008 compared to $16.4 million in 2007. The increase was due to amortization of intangibles from recent acquisitions, particularly CEDES, Incuity, Pavilion and Industrial Control Services Group Limited, which does business as ICS Triplex.  

24   
General Corporate  Net  

General corporate expenses were $77.2 million in 2008 compared to $72.8 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to lower interest and dividend income in 2008 compared to 2007, partially offset by reduced charitable contributions in 2008 and lower environmental remediation charges at legacy sites compared to 2007.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense was $68.2 million in 2008 compared to $63.4 million in 2007. The increase was due to higher average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by lower interest rates than the prior year.  

Special Items  

In 2008, we incurred special charges of $50.7 million ($34.0 million after tax, or $0.23 per diluted share) related to restructuring actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. This charge was partially offset by the reversal of $4.0 million ($3.6 million net of tax or $0.02 per diluted share) of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions as employee attrition differed from our original estimates. The 2008 restructuring actions include workforce reductions aimed at streamlining administrative functions, realigning selling resources to the highest anticipated growth opportunities and consolidating business units.  

Special items of $43.5 million in 2007 include costs related to various restructuring actions designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy. Actions included workforce reductions, realignment of administrative functions and rationalization and consolidation of global operations.  

See Note 14 in the Financial Statements for more information on restructuring charges and special items.  

Income Taxes  

The effective tax rate for 2008 was 28.6 percent compared to 27.8 percent in 2007. The effective tax rate in 2008 was lower than the statutory tax rate of 35 percent because of lower tax rates on income outside the United States and because we used foreign tax credits. The tax rate in 2008 was higher than 2007 because we favorably resolved various federal and state matters in the prior year.  

The 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower non-U.S. tax rates, resolved certain tax matters and claims related to the closure of the 2005 U.S. federal audit cycle and various state tax audits and made other provision adjustments.  

See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2008 and 2007 affecting the respective tax rates.  

Income from Continuing Operations  

Income from continuing operations in 2008 increased $8.3 million compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to productivity performance and higher volume, partially offset by increased investment spending to support globalization, growth and technology, increased purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, inflation and a higher effective income tax rate.  

Discontinued Operations  

Amounts reported for discontinued operations in 2007 primarily relate to the operating results of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment for periods before the divestiture and the gain on sale of the principal businesses of that operating segment. Net income on operating activities of Power Systems was $42.3 million in 2007. We reported an after-tax gain on the sale of Power Systems of $868.2 million ($5.39 per share) in 2007.  

We also reported after-tax income of $8.0 million during 2007 related to other discontinued operations activities. See Note 13 in the Financial Statements for more information on discontinued operations.  

25   
Architecture & Software 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales  

Architecture & Software sales increased 9 percent compared to 2007. Organic growth accounted for 3 percentage points of the increase, as foreign currency translation and acquisitions added 5 and 1 percentage points to the growth rate, respectively. Logix sales grew 12 percent in 2008 compared to 2007, partially offset by a decline in our legacy processor sales.  

Operating Margin  

Segment operating margin decreased by 2.3 points in 2008 compared to 2007 and was negatively impacted by increased investment spending to support technology and growth, year-over-year impact of acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency, partially offset by volume leverage and productivity.  

Control Products & Solutions  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Sales  

Control Products & Solutions sales increased 18 percent compared to 2007. Organic sales growth was 9 percent, as foreign currency translation and acquisitions added 5 and 4 percentage points to the growth rate, respectively. Year-over-year results benefited from our growth initiatives and strong results from our solutions businesses, especially in resource-based end markets.  

Operating Margin  

Segment operating margin decreased 0.9 points in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the mix between our product and solutions businesses, the impact of foreign currency, increased investment spending and the negative impact of acquisitions, partially offset by strong productivity performance, volume leverage and price.  

26   
Financial Condition  

The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. Our accounting for share-based compensation requires us to report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.  

Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. Cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects. U.S. federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds. These taxes paid in 2008 and 2007 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses.  

Free cash flow was a source of $430.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to a source of $458.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. This decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in current year earnings and an increase in payments related to restructuring actions, partially offset by improvements in working capital resulting from our lower sales volume, refunds related to a contractual tax matter and lower capital expenditures.  

In December 2007, we issued an aggregate of $500 million principal amount of our 5.65% notes due 2017 and 6.25% debentures due 2037. The debt offering yielded approximately $493.5 million of proceeds, which were used to repay at maturity our 6.15% notes due January 15, 2008 and for general corporate purposes.  

In January 2007, we received $1.75 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. We used the cash proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture, to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire ICS Triplex.  

Commercial paper is our principal source of short-term financing. At September 30, 2009, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. At September 30, 2008, commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $100.0 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2 percent.

In 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock, all of which occurred in October 2008. The total cost of these shares was $50.0 million. This is compared to purchases of approximately 6.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $355.1 million in 2008. Of these purchases, 0.1 million shares amounting to $3.5 million did not settle until October 2008 and were recorded in accounts payable at September 30, 2008. Our decision to repurchase stock in 2010 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. At September 30, 2009 we had approximately $621.2 million remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization. See Part II, Item 5, Market for the Companys Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding share repurchases.  

We expect future uses of cash to include dividends to shareowners, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our pension plans, acquisitions of businesses, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt. We expect capital expenditures in 2010 to be about $110 million. We expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities.  

In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 40.7 percent at September 30, 2009 and 37.3 percent at September 30, 2008. This increase is primarily due to a $360.3 million reduction in shareowners equity, net of tax, related to the funded status of our pension plans, which decreased as a result of lower discount rates and a decrease in our pension plan assets.  

On March 16, 2009 we replaced our former five-year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with two new unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $535.0 million. Both new facilities have borrowing limits of $267.5 million each. One facility has a three-year term and the other facility has a 364-day term. Our 364-day credit facility includes a term-out option that allows us to borrow, on March 15, 2010, up to $267.5 million as a term loan for one year. We have not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at September 30, 2009 or 2008. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at September 30, 2009 and 2008. In addition to our two $267.5 million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $169.7 million at September 30, 2009 were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries.  

The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2009:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Among other uses, we can draw on our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in the table above. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facilities, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.  

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. We have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.  

We regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.  

28   
We enter into contracts to hedge certain third-party sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.  

Cash dividends to shareowners were $164.5 million in 2009, $170.2 million in 2008, and $184.7 million in 2007 ($1.16 per share each year). Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.29 per outstanding share, which is determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.  

A summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2009 are (in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (a)   The amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest, but exclude the unamortized discount of $45.3 million. See Note 6 in the Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt.  

 (b)   Our postretirement plans are unfunded and are subject to change. Amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.  

 (c)   Amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known commitments. Contributions to our pension plans beyond 2010 will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. Amounts subsequent to 2010 are excluded from the summary above, as these amounts cannot be estimated with certainty. The minimum contribution for our U.S. pension plan as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is zero. We may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.  

 (d)   This item includes long-term obligations under agreements with various service providers.  

 (e)   Other long-term liabilities include environmental liabilities net of related receivables, asset retirement obligations, and indemnifications. Amounts subsequent to 2010 are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.  

 (f)   Amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or paid.   

Supplemental Sales Information  

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency rates affect our reported sales. Sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. We determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management.  

Retirement Benefits  

Pension Benefits  

Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.  

Our global pension expense in 2009 was $32.7 million compared to $28.6 million in 2008. Approximately 51 percent of our 2009 global pension expense relates to our U.S. pension plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2009 U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of 6.75 percent (compared to 6.50 percent for 2008); expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.00 percent (compared to 8.00 percent for 2008); and an assumed long-term compensation increase rate of 4.20 percent (compared to 4.15 percent for 2008).  

We changed our measurement date in 2009 from June 30 to September 30 as required by U.S. GAAP. We recorded a reduction in retained earnings of $8.2 million ($5.3 million net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change.  

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law; and, our 2009 pension plan valuation has been completed based on the final guidance. This valuation resulted in no minimum contributions being required in 2009.  

We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $71.2 million in 2010, an increase of approximately $38.5 million from 2009. For 2010, our U.S. discount rate will decrease to 6.20 percent. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Our assumed rate of return on U.S. plan assets will remain at 8.00 percent. We considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption. We have assumed a U.S. long-term compensation increase rate of 4.30 percent in 2010. We established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings.  

The changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost. The change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumption for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

More information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.  

31   
Other Postretirement Benefits  

We estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to calculate our 2009 other postretirement benefits expense was 6.50 percent (compared to 6.25 percent in 2008). For 2010, the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 6.00 percent. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.  

Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. As a result of this amendment, our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since January 1, 2005.  

We changed our measurement date in 2009 from June 30 to September 30 as required by U.S. GAAP. We recorded a reduction in retained earnings of $4.0 million ($2.5 million net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change.  

Net periodic benefit cost in 2009 was $15.8 million compared to $15.4 million in 2008. We expect net periodic benefit cost in 2010 of approximately $14.0 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate $215.8 million.  

More information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements.  

Revenue Recognition  

For approximately 80 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.  

We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified.  

We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history.  

Returns, Rebates and Incentives  

Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.  

We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $6.1 million.  

32   
Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of offset exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was $116.1 million at September 30, 2009 and $137.8 million at September 30, 2008, of which $8.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $13.2 million at September 30, 2008 was included as an offset to accounts receivable.  

Fair Value Measurements  

Share-based compensation  

Share-based compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to $18.7 million in 2009, $21.5 million in 2008 and $18.8 million in 2007. Compensation costs are based on the grant-date fair value of the instruments using a valuation model, and are recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term. We estimate the average risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument outstanding in order to determine fair value of stock options granted. The valuation model is most sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions.  

Stock options granted during 2009 had a weighted average fair value of $7.75 per share. The chart below illustrates the weighted average fair value assuming a 10 percent change in the expected volatility and term assumptions:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Asset Retirement Obligations  

We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. A significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. We recorded these liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which totaled $2.9 million in other current liabilities and $23.9 million in other liabilities at September 30, 2009 and $5.1 million in other current liabilities and $22.8 million in other liabilities at September 30, 2008.  

Indemnifications  

In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal, environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale. We recorded a liability and a reduction to the gain on sale under relevant U.S. GAAP guarantor accounting rules related to these indemnification obligations. A significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. We estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate $25.9 million, of which $11.1 million and $10.5 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and $11.3 million and $12.9 million has been accrued in other liabilities at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

33   
Derivatives  

We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years (cash flow hedges). We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging instruments to offset transaction gains and losses associated with certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. The fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the balance sheet, which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. Unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets in the amounts of $25.0 million and $6.1 million and in other assets in the amounts of $11.4 million and $5.1 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Unrealized losses on derivative instruments are recorded in other current liabilities in the amounts of $19.1 million and $16.2 million and in other liabilities in the amounts of $9.4 million and $8.4 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

Purchase Accounting, Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets  

When we acquire a business, we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value at the date of acquisition. In order to value acquired identifiable intangible assets and determine their amortizable lives, management must use judgment in selecting relevant assumptions. See Note 2 in the Financial Statements for a discussion of acquisitions in 2009, 2008 and 2007.  

In years subsequent to the year of acquisition, we perform an annual impairment test on our goodwill balance. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. We have determined that our reporting units are our two operating segments: Control Products & Solutions and Architecture & Software, as we have concluded that components one level below these segments do not constitute reporting units.  

We use a discounted cash flow valuation model to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units. We also compare the sum of the computed fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization to verify reasonableness. The fair value of each reporting unit determined during the 2009 impairment test significantly exceeded the net asset book value of each reporting unit. The valuation model is most sensitive to the discount rate, perpetuity growth rate and tax rate assumptions. A ten percent change in any one of these assumptions would not change the outcome of the goodwill impairment test, as the fair value of each reporting unit would continue to significantly exceed the net asset book value. We have not changed our goodwill impairment testing valuation techniques during the current year.  

We also perform an annual impairment test on our Allen-Bradley® and ICS TriplexTM trademarks, as these trademarks have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization. We use the relief-from-royalty method to determine the fair value of the trademarks, which we compare to the book value to determine whether impairment is warranted. Inputs into the model requiring the most judgment are revenue growth and discount factor. A ten percent change in either one of these assumptions would not result in impairment of either of our indefinite lived intangible assets.  

Litigation, Claims and Contingencies  

We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third-party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third-party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change.  

34   
Our reserve for environmental matters was $33.4 million, net of related receivables of $24.8 million, at September 30, 2009 and $33.2 million, net of related receivables of $22.8 million, at September 30, 2008. Our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations.  

Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability where we are self-insured up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was $16.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $23.0 million at September 30, 2008.  

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business. As described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Part I, Item 3 for further discussion.  

More information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements.  

Income Taxes  

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments.  

While we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns, taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products, services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. We recognized a $6.7 million decrease in shareowners equity as of October 1, 2008 related to a change in accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with changes in U.S. GAAP. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, was recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the amount of $116.7 million at September 30, 2009 and $125.8 million at September 30, 2008. The amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was $40.9 million at September 30, 2009 and $43.2 million at September 30, 2008. In addition, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would be reported in discontinued operations if recognized was $26.7 million at September 30, 2009 and $33.4 million at September 30, 2008. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. Total accrued interest and penalties were $27.6 million at September 30, 2009 and $26.0 million at September 30, 2008. We believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $26.8 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations.  

We recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards (Carryforwards) and certain temporary differences in the amount of $43.8 million at September 30, 2009 and $45.1 million at September 30, 2008 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the Carryforward amount will be realized. Our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more Carryforwards than currently expected.  

35   
At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income, permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies. We use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis, excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects. We record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.  

More information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements.
