MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS MD&A  

Our MD&A includes the following major sections:  

     economic and market conditions affecting our operations;  

     financial performance summary;  

     results of our operations  consolidated and by segment;  

     liquidity and capital resources  where we discuss our cash flows;  

     off-balance sheet arrangements;  

     environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and  

     accounting matters  where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.  

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS  

For the last two years we have experienced the effects of the most severe recession since the 1930s. The U.S. housing market experienced a significant downturn in this recession and remains very weak. The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberlands segments. Real Estate focuses on building single family homes. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is driven by the production of wood-based building products. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the value of the U.S. dollar.  

HOUSING MARKET  

We track certain indicators such as housing starts, home sales, employment, consumer confidence, foreclosures, home prices, mortgage interest rates and access to mortgages, and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions.  

Nationally, employment declined in every month of 2009. In December 2009, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent from 7.4 percent in December 2008. Unemployment in two states where our Real Estate segment has operations was higher than the December 2009 national average. The December unemployment rate in Nevada was 13 percent and in California was 12.4 percent according to Bureau of Labor reports. 

The sustained drop in employment contributed to the consumer confidence index plunging to a record low in the spring of 2009. The consumer confidence index was initiated in 1967. 

Foreclosure filings during 2009 increased 21 percent compared to 2008. Specific markets in which our home builders operate had higher than average foreclosure rates  Nevada, Arizona and California had three of the top four foreclosure rates in the country at 10 percent, 6 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively. Californias foreclosure activity in total was the highest of the fifty states in 2009 and increased 21 percent from 2008. The national homeowner vacancy rate edged lower to 2.6 percent, yet remained well above the historical average of 1.6 percent. 

New home sales in the U.S. totaled 374,000 units in 2009. This was a record low and down 71 percent from the record high of 2005. 

U.S. single-family housing starts bottomed at an annual rate of 360,000 units in first quarter 2009. During the second half, the rate of housing starts was 485,000 units annually. For the year, single-family starts totaled 443,000 units. This resulted in an inventory of new homes for sale at the lowest level since 1971.  

The housing market conditions described above contributed to a 32 percent decrease in the number of single-family homes closed and a 6 percent drop in the average price for homes closed in our Real Estate operations during 2009.  

The depressed level of new home construction and an estimated 15 to 20 percent decrease in repair and remodeling spending resulted in decreased demand for wood products by 40 to 50 percent from the peak of 2006. Industry operating rates for lumber and oriented strand board (OSB) averaged between 50 and 60 percent of capacity. As a result, lumber and OSB prices were at or below estimated cash costs during 2009. The price of Douglas fir green 2x4s, the preferred building product in southern California, dropped to 1980-85 levels in nominal dollar terms. Demand decreased for both domestic Douglas fir logs grown in our western timberlands and lumber produced in our western system.  

The price of logs supplied for lumber production fell throughout the first three quarters of 2009 due to lower demand. 

U.S. DOLLAR/GLOBAL DEMAND  

Following the onset of the financial crisis in September 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened by 15 to 20 percent relative to the Canadian dollar and Euro. The U.S. dollar stayed at these levels through first quarter 2009. Since then, the dollar has weakened to trading levels that existed prior to the beginning of the financial crisis  0.94US$/C$ and 1.47US$/Euro.

Table of Contents 

The Cellulose Fibers business benefitted from the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to European and Canadian producers. Demand for bleached market pulp is estimated to have fallen 0.9 percent in 2009. While demand decreased in the developed countries, demand in China increased 33 percent.  

The combination of the weaker dollar, steady global demand and decreased capacity resulted in a 35 percent increase in the key indicator pulp price in 2009. This followed a 35 percent drop in the price of market pulp from second quarter 2008 to first quarter 2009. 

The weaker dollar against the Yen contributed to more stable export log prices despite the sharp decline in wooden housing starts in Japan in 2009. The export log market was also helped by higher demand from China in fourth quarter 2009.  

WHERE WE ARE HEADED  

The U.S. economy has improved during first quarter 2010, but this improvement appears unlikely to generate meaningful job growth in the quarter. Existing home sales could decline as there appears to be lower demand for the extended first-time buyer tax credit. The tax credit for current owners is expected to generate few additional home sales as many owners do not have the equity to buy larger homes. Single-family starts are expected to be higher in the quarter given the record low inventory of new homes for sale. Wood products demand is projected to increase slightly, partially as a result of the rebuilding of inventories by dealers and wholesalers. The weakness of the U.S. dollar is expected to be favorable for U.S. market pulp producers, which is expected to lead to higher pulp prices in U.S. dollar terms.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

In December 2008, the board of directors approved an amendment to our bylaws to adopt a December 31 fiscal year-end, effective for fiscal year-end 2008. Prior to 2008, our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, the number of days in our fiscal year varied. For the last three years:  

     Fiscal year 2009 had 365 days.  

     Fiscal year 2008 had 367 days.  

     Fiscal year 2007 had 364 days.  

In reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms:  

     Price realizations refer to net selling prices  this includes selling price plus freight minus normal sales deductions.  

     Net contribution to earnings can be positive or negative and refers to earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeusers shareholders before interest expense not capitalized and income taxes.  

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

Net sales and revenue and operating income numbers reported in our consolidated results do not include the activity of our discontinued operations:  

     Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations (sold in August 2008);  

     Australian operations (sold in July 2008); and  

     Fine Paper operations (divested in March 2007).  

We report these activities and results as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. However, we include the results of these operations in the segment discussions that follow. See Note 3: Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our discontinued operations.  

HOW WE DID IN 2009  

Summary of Financial Results  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $2.6 billion  32 percent.  

     Net loss attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $631 million  54 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the continued market challenges for the U.S. homebuilding industry and weak pulp markets, reflected in the following:  

     significantly lower demand and prices for residential building products along with the closure and curtailment of a number of facilities  refer to the Wood Products segment discussion;  

     declines in the number of single-family homes closed and average selling prices  refer to the Real Estate segment discussion;  

     lower pulp sales realizations  refer to the Cellulose Fibers segment discussion; and  

     decreased western log sales due to weaker export and domestic markets  refer to the Timberlands segment discussion.

Table of Contents 

Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders  

Net loss attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $631 million primarily due to the factors listed below.  

Reductions to pretax net loss included:  

     $1.7 billion decrease in asset impairment charges primarily related to our Real Estate, Wood Products, Cellulose Fibers and Corporate and Other segments;  

     $344 million recognition of alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009 in our Cellulose Fibers segment;  

     $296 million decrease in selling and general and administrative costs as a result of the implementation of company cost-saving initiatives, a reduction in the number of employees and lower sales volumes across all of our segments;  

     $163 million pretax gain on third quarter 2009 sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon;  

     $137 million decrease in raw materials costs in our Wood Products segment;  

     $95 million decrease in manufacturing, warehousing and delivery costs and other cost of sales in our Wood Products segment;  

     $89 million increase in earnings from foreign exchange gains, primarily resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar; and  

     $80 million decrease in freight, fiber and energy costs primarily in our Cellulose Fibers segment.  

These reductions to net loss during 2009 were partially offset by the following:  

     $1.6 billion of pretax gains recognized on dispositions and investment restructuring during 2008 that did not recur in 2009. This included:  

       $1.2 billion from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

       $218 million from the sale of our Australian operations; and  

       $250 million gain from the restructuring of our joint venture in Uruguay;  

     $259 million due to reduced harvest volumes and lower domestic and export prices in our Timberlands segment;  

     $206 million due to lower sales price realizations in our Wood Products segment;  

     $204 million loss of earnings due to the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

     $203 million due to lower pulp prices and lower pulp sales volumes in our Cellulose Fibers segment;  

     $110 million increase in restructuring and closure charges primarily related to our Corporate and Other and Wood Products segments;  

     $55 million decrease in pretax earnings from Westwood Shipping operations as well as loss of pretax earnings from international operations that were disposed of in 2008; and  

     $52 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 from changes in our U.S. postretirement plans for salaried employees in the U.S.  

In addition, income tax expense decreased $424 million primarily due to taxes related to the gains from our discontinued operation transactions in 2008 that did not recur in 2009.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Asset impairments and related charges increased $1.8 billion.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $2.8 billion  26 percent.  

     Net earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $2 billion.  

Asset Impairments and Related Charges  

We continually monitor our assets for potential impairment, particularly in light of market conditions. The upheaval in financial markets during fourth quarter 2008 was accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets and a continued decline in demand and pricing for most of our wood products. In addition, declining demand in emerging Asian markets, primarily China, adversely affected our Cellulose Fibers operations. We recognized significant asset impairments in our Real Estate segment during the first three quarters of 2008 and the accelerated deterioration of market conditions triggered additional impairments in fourth quarter. The continued deterioration of market conditions also led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments was impaired in fourth quarter 2008.  

Our asset impairments and related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders increased $1.8 billion  from approximately $330 million in 2007 to approximately $2.1 billion in 2008. The increase included:  

     $808 million in impairments of goodwill in our Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments and  

     $984 million in asset impairment and related charges in our Real Estate and Corporate and Other segments.  

Partially offsetting these increased charges is a $24 million decrease in impairments recorded in connection with closures, curtailments or sales of operations.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased significantly, primarily due to continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market. Declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    33

 softwood lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and engineered lumber. Sales of products within our Wood Products segment, excluding those of discontinued operations, were $1.9 billion  34 percent  lower than 2007. These difficult market conditions also affected our Real Estate segment, where net sales and revenues decreased $951 million  40 percent  from 2007.  

Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders  

Net earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $2 billion primarily due to the factors listed below.  

Reductions to pretax net earnings included:  

     $1.8 billion increase in pretax asset impairments and related charges discussed above;  

     $93 million increase in foreign exchange losses primarily due to an 18 percent decline in the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar average exchange rate in 2008;  

     $270 million decrease in pretax earnings due to lower price realizations for softwood lumber, engineered products and hardwood lumber in our Wood Products segment;  

     $334 million increase in losses on land sales;  

     $253 million decrease in pretax earnings resulting from lower sales prices and higher land, construction and development costs of single-family homes in our Real Estate segment; and  

     $118 million decrease in pretax earnings from lower price realizations and a change in mix of log sales in our Timberlands segment.  

Partially offsetting these reductions to pretax net earnings were:  

     $953 million increase in pretax gains on dispositions and investment restructuring.  

       Pretax gains of $1.6 billion recognized during 2008 included:  

       $1.2 billion from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

       $218 million from the sale of our Australian operations; and  

       $250 million gain from the restructuring of our joint venture in Uruguay.  

       Pretax gains of $690 million recognized in 2007 included:  

       $606 million from the Domtar Transaction and  

       $84 million from the disposition of property operating facilities and our New Zealand investments.  

     $173 million increase in sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment.  

     $52 million gain from changes in our postretirement plans for current salaried employees in the U.S. in 2008.  

In addition, income tax expense increased $211 million. Taxes related to gains from discontinued operation transactions increased approximately $1 billion primarily related to the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008. This change was largely offset by tax benefits related to our increased loss from continuing operations as compared with 2007 and a $57 million benefit we recognized related to timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (Tree Act) of 2008.  

TIMBERLANDS  

HOW WE DID IN 2009  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Timberlands.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers, intersegment sales, and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net contribution to earnings for Timberlands  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 34     

Table of Contents 

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $178 million  27 percent.  

     Sales of other products to unaffiliated customers decreased $7 million  3 percent.  

     Intersegment sales decreased $497 million  48 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $46 million  12 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  Unaffiliated Customers  

The $185 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:  

     $218 million decrease  40 percent  in log sales in the West as sales volumes decreased 36 percent and price realizations decreased 6 percent due to weaker domestic and export markets; 

     $7 million decrease  35 percent  in log sales in Canada as sales volume in Canada decreased 23 percent and price realizations decreased 15 percent primarily due to weaker demand; and  

     $7 million decrease  3 percent  in other sales and revenues from unaffiliated customers primarily due to lower timberlands exchange revenues.  

These decreases were partially offset by $47 million  48 percent  increase in log sales in the South as sales volumes increased 51 percent, primarily due to sales of fiber logs to International Paper for use at locations that previously were owned by Weyerhaeuser and higher grade log sales to domestic customers.  

Intersegment Sales  

The $497 million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from:  

     fewer Weyerhaeuser mills in operation as a result of closures and curtailments of Wood Products operations in the United States; and  

     sales to Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations became third-party sales after we sold the business to International Paper in August 2008.  

Net contribution to earnings  

The $46 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from:  

     $146 million due to a 40 percent reduction in harvest in the West and 27 percent reduction in harvest in the South;  

     $113 million due to lower domestic and export prices in the West and South; and  

     $15 million due to asset impairments attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $163 million pretax gain on a sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon in third quarter 2009;  

     $44 million reduction of operating costs, including lower salvage logging costs, lower fuel costs and reduced spending on silviculture; and  

     $23 million reduction in selling, general and administrative costs as a result of cost cutting measures.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $5 million  1 percent.  

     Other sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $28 million  11 percent.  

     Intersegment sales decreased $312 million  23 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings declined $243 million  39 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  Unaffiliated Customers  

The $23 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:  

     $18 million decrease  3 percent  in log sales in the West primarily due to:  

       Average price realizations dropped 14 percent with the slowing domestic market and the declining U.S. housing market.  

       Partially offset by increased sales volume, both export and domestic, of 12 percent due to more available whitewood volume created by the December 2007 storm salvage logging.  

     $18 million decrease  47 percent  in log sales in Canada primarily due to:  

       Sales volume in Canada dropped 43 percent as a result of having fewer operations in Canada.  

       Average price realizations decreased 9 percent.  

     $49 million decrease  22 percent  in other sales and revenues from unaffiliated customers primarily due to lower timberlands exchange revenues.  

These decreases were partially offset by:  

     $41 million increase  73 percent  in log sales in the South as a result of increases in both volume and price.  

       We sold our containerboard mills to International Paper in August 2008. Log sales to those mills were previously reported as intersegment sales. Sales to the mills are now reported as sales to unaffiliated customers.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    35 

Table of Contents 

       Fiber prices in the South increased due to lower available residual chip volumes as sawmills took market downtime.  

     $21 million increase  53 percent  in minerals, oil and gas revenue.  

Intersegment Sales  

The $312 million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from:  

     $125 million decrease due to a 35 percent decrease in the volume of logs sold to our Canadian mills as a result of fewer facilities and increased market downtime;  

     $58 million decrease due to a 7 percent decline in the volume of logs sold to our U.S. mills as a result of the slower housing market;  

     $58 million decrease due to a 20 percent decline in average log price realizations in the West; and  

     $57 million decrease as sales to Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations became third-party sales after we sold our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business to International Paper in August 2008.  

Net contribution to earnings  

The $243 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from:  

     $118 million decrease due to lower price realizations and a change in the mix of log sales to more whitewood and less Douglas fir;  

     $68 million decrease from fewer sales or exchanges of nonstrategic timberlands;  

     $67 million decrease due to higher operating costs driven by higher diesel prices for logging, trucking, handling and silviculture activities and by salvage logging costs resulting from the December 2007 West Coast windstorm; and  

     $27 million decrease as 2007 included a pretax gain on the sale of a Western export facility that did not recur in 2008.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $30 million increase in oil, gas and land management lease revenues; and  

     $10 million increase, as 2007 included a casualty loss from the December 2007 West Coast windstorm that did not recur in 2008.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

Excluding the effect of sales of non-strategic land, we expect first quarter operating earnings from the segment to be comparable to fourth quarter, primarily due to improved log sales realizations, offset by higher costs.  

WOOD PRODUCTS  

HOW WE DID IN 2009  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Wood Products business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Wood Products.   

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net contribution to earnings for Wood Products  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $1.5 billion  41 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $814 million.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased $1.5 billion  41 percent  primarily due to the following:  

     Softwood lumber average price realizations decreased $42 per thousand board feet (MBF)  14 percent.  

 36     

Table of Contents 

     Engineered solid section average price realizations decreased $56 per hundred cubic feet  3 percent.  

     Engineered I-joists average price realizations decreased $89 per thousand lineal feet  7 percent.  

     Oriented strand board (OSB) average price realizations decreased $7 per thousand square feet 3/8"  4 percent.  

     Plywood average price realizations decreased $50 per thousand square feet 3/8"  14 percent.  

     Hardwood lumber average price realizations decreased $83 per MBF  9 percent.  

     Sales of other products purchased for resale decreased 45 percent as a result of the sale of Canadian and selected U.S. distribution centers and overall decline in demand for building products.  

     Shipment volumes decreased across all product lines as follows:  

       Softwood lumber decreased 1.4 billion board feet  29 percent.  

       Engineered solid section decreased 10 million cubic feet  41 percent.  

       Engineered I-joists decreased 88 million lineal feet  39 percent.  

       OSB decreased 1 billion square feet 3/8"  41 percent.  

       Pywood decreased 267 million square feet 3/8"  47 percent.  

       Hardwood lumber decreased 72 million board feet  22 percent.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings improved $814 million primarily due to the following:  

     $730 million decrease in impairments of goodwill and other assets;  

     $137 million decrease in raw materials, mainly due to decreased log costs;  

     $110 million decrease in selling and administrative charges resulting from staff reductions and continued focus on reducing costs;  

     $57 million decrease in manufacturing and other cost of sales due to mill optimizations and production efficiencies; and  

     $38 million decrease in warehousing and delivery costs as a result of lower shipment volumes and closures of distribution center facilities.  

These improvements were partially offset by the following:  

     $206 million decrease due to lower sales price realizations and  

     $25 million decrease in contributions from other products purchased for resale as a result of reduced market demand and closed distribution facilities.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Impairments of long-lived assets increased $691 million.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $1.9 billion34 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $813 million.  

Asset Impairments  

The accelerated deterioration of market conditions in fourth quarter 2008 adversely affected the results of our Wood Products operations and led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our iLevel reporting unit was impaired.  

The fair-value analysis took into account:  

     the industrys reduced market multiples,  

     recent and expected operating performance and  

     an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends would likely continue.  

Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $733 million in the Wood Products segment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total goodwill impairments in 2008 for the segment were $744 million.  

During 2008, we also recognized $98 million of other asset-impairment charges in the Wood Products segment in connection with the expected closure, curtailment or sale of operations. This compares with total Wood Products asset-impairment charges of $119 million in 2007.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased $1.9 billion  34 percent  primarily due to the following:  

     Softwood lumber average price realizations decreased $37 per thousand board feet (MBF)  11 percent  following the market trend.  

     Engineered I-joists average price realizations decreased $134 per thousand lineal feet  10 percent  and engineered solid section decreased $169 per hundred cubic feet  8 percent  in response to competitive market conditions.  

     Hardwood lumber average price realizations decreased $78 per MBF  8 percent.  

     Sales of other products purchased for resale decreased 42 percent as a result of the sale of Canadian and selected U.S. distribution centers, a reduction in the product lines purchased for resale and overall decline in demand for building products.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    37 

Table of Contents 

     Shipment volumes decreased across all product lines as follows:  

       Lumber decreased 1.8 billion board feet  28 percent.  

       OSB decreased 1 billion square feet 3/8"  30 percent.  

       Shipment volumes of engineered I-joists decreased 111 million lineal feet  33 percent.  

       Engineered solid section decreased 8 million cubic feet  26 percent.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings decreased $813 million primarily due to the following:  

     $744 million of charges in 2008 for the impairment of goodwill  compared with $30 million in 2007; and  

     $270 million decrease resulting from lower price realizations for softwood lumber, engineered products and hardwood lumber.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $78 million reduction in selling and administrative expense;  

     $171 million in charges for facility closures, other asset impairments, restructuring costs and litigation compared to $212 million in 2007; and  

     $13 million benefit recognized in connection with a reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims.  

In addition, net contribution to earnings increased due to reductions in raw material, warehousing and delivery costs. However, these reductions were offset by increased manufacturing costs resulting from reduced operating postures and ongoing costs at curtailed facilities.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

We expect a lower operating loss in first quarter due to improved operating rates and anticipated sales realization improvements for lumber and OSB.  

CELLULOSE FIBERS  

HOW WE DID IN 2009  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Cellulose Fibers business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Cellulose Fibers.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net contribution to earnings for Cellulose Fibers  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $254 million  14 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $297 million  202 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The effects of the global economic recession  weaker pulp demand and a stronger U.S. dollar  resulted in decreased sales realizations from fourth quarter 2008 through first half 2009. Pulp prices improved in the second half as the U.S. dollar weakened and demand strengthened. The $254 million decrease in net sales and revenues for the full year 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the following:  

     Pulp price realizations decreased $120 per ton  15 percent;  

     Sales volume of pulp decreased approximately 7,000 tons;  

     Sales volume of liquid packaging board decreased approximately 14,000 tons  5 percent; and  

     Sales price of liquid packaging increased $46 per ton  5 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings increased $297 million primarily due to the following:  

     $344 million increase due to alternative fuel mixture credits, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information related to alternative fuel mixture credits;  

     $94 million goodwill impairment charge in fourth quarter 2008, which did not recur in 2009;  

     $80 million decrease in fiber, freight and energy costs, primarily related to lower prices for chips and fuel;  

     $46 million decrease in other operating and maintenance costs, primarily as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. exchange rate on Canadian operating costs year over year;  

     $13 million increase in liquid packaging board price realizations; and  

     $12 million decrease in administrative costs as a result of cost reduction activities.  

These increases were partially offset by the following decreases:  

     $203 million due to lower pulp prices and lower pulp sales volumes, as global market demand decreased from the prior year;  

     $40 million as a result of lower production, primarily due to maintenance downtime and market downtime in the first half of the year;  

     $26 million due to lower other product realizations; and  

     $23 million in other non operating income and earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture due to lower newsprint market prices.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Asset impairments increased $92 million.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $67 million  4 percent. 

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $82 million  36 percent.  

Asset Impairments  

The accelerated deterioration of market conditions in fourth quarter 2008 was accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in demand for pulp from developing Asian markets and a severe downturn in the global pulp market, which resulted in a significant decline in pulp prices. These developments led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Cellulose Fibers reporting unit was impaired.  

The fair-value analysis takes into account:  

     the industrys reduced market multiples,  

     recent and expected operating performance and  

     an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends will likely continue.  

Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $94 million in the Cellulose Fibers segment in fourth quarter 2008.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased 4 percent for the year primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume, which was partially offset by an increase in average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board.  

For the full year 2008 compared with 2007:  

     Average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging improved primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar and strong demand.  

       Pulp price realizations improved $82 per ton  11 percent.  

       Liquid packaging board price realizations improved $94 per ton  11 percent.  

     Sales volume of pulp declined approximately 366,000 tons  18 percent. The volume decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the Kamloops, British Columbia, pulp mill and other white paper mills in the Domtar Transaction in first quarter 2007.  

     Sales volume of liquid packaging increased approximately 16,000 tons  6 percent.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings decreased $82 million primarily due to the following:  

     $94 million goodwill impairment charge in fourth quarter as discussed above;  

     $50 million reduction in earnings from lower pulp sales volumes;  

     $41 million increase in chemical costs primarily due to higher prices;  

     $38 million increase in freight costs primarily related to higher fuel prices and ocean freight;  

     $37 million increase in operating costs, including maintenance, depreciation and the effect of the strengthening of the Canadian exchange rate on Canadian operating costs; and  

     $33 million increase in fiber and energy costs primarily related to higher prices paid for chips and fuel.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $173 million from increased price realizations as a result of improved market conditions  $140 million from pulp and $33 million from liquid packaging board;  

     $20 million increase in earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture primarily due to higher newsprint market prices; and  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    39 

Table of Contents 

     $18 million in reduced expenses primarily from productivity improvements, cost reductions and increased cost recovery from slush pulp sales.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

Excluding the effect of alternative fuel mixture credits, which ended in 2009, we expect earnings from operations for first quarter to be comparable to fourth quarter. Annual maintenance and fiber costs are expected to increase. These costs are expected to offset improved pulp price realizations.  

REAL ESTATE  

HOW WE DID IN 2009  

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate.   

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net contribution to earnings for Real Estate  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $504 million  36 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $1.1 billion  78 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $504 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:  

     Single-family revenues decreased $462 million  36 percent. This included:  

       $410 million due to a 32 percent decrease in single-family home closings and  

       $52 million due to a 6 percent decrease in the average sales price of homes closed.  

     Land and lot sales decreased $31 million  31 percent.  

     Other revenue decreased $11 million.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.1 billion increase in net contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $815 million decrease in impairments and write-offs of preacquisition and abandoned community costs attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders;  

     $233 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales;  

 40     

Table of Contents 

     $82 million benefit from lower selling, general and administrative costs, primarily due to lower sales volumes, a reduction in the number of open communities, and general cost cutting measures, including a reduction in headcount.  

Offsetting the increase was:  

     $56 million decrease in single-family gross margin, primarily the result of fewer closings at lower prices; and  

     $17 million increase in restructuring charges, primarily related to vacated office space and headcount reductions.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Impairments and other related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders increased $906 million.  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $951 million  40 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $1.56 billion.  

Impairments and Other Related Charges Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Shareholders  

We continually monitor our assets for potential impairment, particularly in light of the current market conditions. Additionally, we control some land through deposits with land sellers that defer the payment of the full acquisition price until certain entitlements are obtained. We also control some land through structured options offered by land sellers.  

In 2008, we recorded $874 million in impairments and other related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders for real estate projects, joint ventures and intangible assets. This compares with $128 million in impairments and other related charges for real estate projects recorded in 2007. There was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the eroding market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tighter credit standards. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the already-depressed housing market was further affected by increased financial turmoil. Job losses, both actual and announced, and a loss of consumer confidence reduced the number of potential home buyers. Increasing foreclosures added inventory to the marketplace causing lower appraisal values and home sale prices.  

In light of these deteriorating market conditions and increased uncertainty regarding the timing of recovery, the company reviewed its homebuilding projects and land portfolio to determine whether the assets would continue to be held for development or sold. During fourth quarter 2008, management decided to sell some of its land portfolio, which required the company to write the land assets down to current fair value, resulting in impairments. Impairments also were recorded on projects and land held for development.  

In addition, we recorded $128 million in investment impairments and other related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders for our real estate investments in 2008 compared with $36 million in 2007.  

In 2008, we also wrote off $74 million in costs associated with option deposits and other preacquisition costs related to land parcels that we decided not to acquire. In 2007, we wrote off $6 million of option deposits and preacquisition costs.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $951 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:  

     Single-family revenues decreased $785 million  38 percent. This included:  

       $581 million due to a 28 percent decrease in single-family home closings and  

       $204 million due to a 14 percent decrease in the average sales price of homes closed.  

     Land and lot sales decreased $114 million  54 percent.  

     Other revenue decreased $52 million as 2007 included revenue of $49 million from an apartment building sale with no comparable sale in 2008.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.56 billion decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     Impairments and preacquisition cost write-offs attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders caused a decrease of $906 million.  

     Single-family activities caused a decrease of $253 million  55 percent  due to lower sales prices and higher land, construction and development costs. Single-family activity includes net sales less cost of goods sold.  

     Land sales resulted in a decrease of $334 million. In 2008 we recorded losses of $219 million in land sales compared with earnings of $115 million in 2007.  

     $42 million decrease resulted from earnings of $42 million for an apartment building sale in 2007 with no comparable sale in 2008.  

Offsetting the decrease was:  

     $33 million benefit from lower selling, general and administrative costs primarily due to lower sales commissions, marketing costs and incentive compensation.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

Excluding asset impairments, restructuring and related charges, we expect the segment to be profitable in first quarter. A loss is expected from single-family homebuilding operations due to seasonally lower closings; however, two commercial partnership interests were sold in January 2010 and will contribute $33 million in earnings.

CORPORATE AND OTHER  

We report what our Corporate and Other segment includes in Our Business/What We Do/Corporate and Other.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contributions to Earnings for Corporate and Other  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

HOW WE DID IN 2009  

     We restructured our corporate support functions. This included reductions in staff and consolidation of office space.  

     We announced changes to our employee and postretirement benefits plans for 2010. These include:  

       modifications to the U.S. pension plan for active employees;  

       reduction of certain company-sponsored retiree life insurance benefits for qualifying U.S. employees;  

       changes in available medical plans for U.S. employees and retirees not eligible for Medicare; and  

       freeze on contributions towards the cost of Canadian non-union retiree benefits.  

The segments results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates primarily related to our Canadian operations, changes in our stock price, pension and postretirement credits (costs), and strategic initiatives outside the operating segments. Results for the Corporate and Other segment also include the net gain on divestitures that affect multiple  

business segments and the disposition of entire business segments.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $227 million  58 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $1.7 billion.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased, primarily due to the sale of our Australian operations in July 2008 and decreased revenue in our transportation business during 2009.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.7 billion decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $1.2 billion pretax gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

     $250 million pretax non-cash gain recognized in 2008 from restructuring our joint ventures in Uruguay in 2008;  

     $218 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of our Australian operations;  

     $64 million reduction in net pension and postretirement credits primarily related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities partially offset by changes in plan participation;  

     $58 million increase in charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities, primarily related to 2009 pension settlements and curtailments;  

     $55 million decrease in earnings from Westwood Shipping operations, as well as international operations that were disposed of in 2008; and  

     $52 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 from changes in our U.S. postretirement plans for salaried employees in the U.S.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $82 million change in net foreign exchange gains and losses  $39 million gain in 2009 compared to $43 million loss in 2008  primarily resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar;  

     $59 million decrease in general and administrative costs as a result of implementing company cost saving initiatives; and  

     $51 million decrease in Weyerhaeusers expense related to previously capitalized interest on excess qualifying assets of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company, primarily due to lower home and land sales in 2009.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

In 2008:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $40 million  9 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $1.1 billion.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our Australian operations in July 2008, partially offset by increased revenue earned in our transportation business  

during 2008.

Table of Contents 

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.1 billion increase in net contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $777 million increase in pretax gains on dispositions  $1.4 billion in 2008 compared with $616 million in 2007. The gains include:  

       $1.2 billion in 2008 from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

       $218 million in 2008 from the sale of our Australian operations;  

       $606 million in 2007 from the Domtar Transaction; and  

       $10 million in 2007 from the sale of our New Zealand investment.  

     $250 million non-cash gain for the restructuring of our joint ventures in Uruguay in 2008;  

     $197 million increase in net pension and postretirement income resulted from the effect of the change to retain most recurring pension and postretirement credits (costs) in Corporate and Other; and  

     $52 million pretax gain in 2008 from changes in our postretirement plans for current salaried employees in the U.S.  

These increases were partially offset by the following:  

     $92 million change in net foreign exchange gains and losses  $43 million loss in 2008 compared with $49 million gain in 2007  primarily a result of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar;  

     $69 million increase in charges related to the write-off of capitalized interest on impaired Real Estate homebuilding assets during 2008;  

     $55 million increased charges for corporate restructuring activities; and  

     $43 million pretax gain from a legal settlement in 2007 with no comparable gain in 2008.  

FINE PAPER  

On March 7, 2007, our Fine Paper operations and related assets were divested in the Domtar Transaction. As a result, the year ended December 30, 2007, includes nine weeks of Fine Paper operations. Subsequent to first quarter 2007, we no longer have results of operations for the Fine Paper segment.  

Here are net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for 2007:

INTEREST EXPENSE  

Including Real Estate and interest expense reported in discontinued operations, our interest expense incurred for the last three years was:  

     $466 million in 2009,  

     $550 million in 2008 and  

     $604 million in 2007.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    43 

Table of Contents 

The decrease in our interest expense incurred is primarily due to reductions in our amount of outstanding debt of approximately:  

     $327 million in 2009,  

     $1.4 billion in 2008 and  

     $846 million in 2007.  

In connection with the repayments, we recognized the following pretax (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt:  

     $28 million in 2009,  

     $(32) million in 2008 and  

     $45 million in 2007.  

INCOME TAXES  

Our benefit for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years were:  

     $274 million in 2009,  

     $900 million in 2008 and  

     $179 million in 2007.  

During 2009, we did not record any one-time tax benefits or charges:  

During 2008, we recorded the following tax benefit:  

     Timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (TREE Act) of 2008 enacted May 22, 2008, resulted in a tax benefit of $57 million. The provision was effective for one year and reduced the capital gains tax rate on qualified timber sales from 35 percent to 15 percent.  

During 2007, we recorded these one-time tax benefits and charges:  

     $22 million deferred tax benefit related to a reduction in the Canadian federal income tax rate and  

     $9 million charge to deferred taxes related to the Flat Rate Business Tax Reform in Mexico.  

In addition, income tax expense (benefit) recorded in connection with divestitures are included in discontinued operations and include the following:  

     tax expense on dispositions of $887 million related to the gain on sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and $58 million related to the gain on sale of our Australian operations in 2008; and  

     a tax benefit of $89 million from the sale of our Fine Paper business and related assets resulting from a rollout of temporary differences on the assets sold in Canada in 2007.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:  

     protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and  

     have access at all times to major financial markets.  

Our policy governing capital has two important elements:  

     viewing the capital structure of Forest Products separately from that of Real Estate because of the very different nature of their assets and business activity and  

     minimizing liquidity risk by managing a combination of maturing short-term and long-term debt.  

The amount of debt and equity for Forest Products and Real Estate will reflect the following:  

     basic earnings capacity and  

     liquidity characteristics of their respective assets.  

CASH FROM OPERATIONS  

Cash from operations includes:  

     cash received from customers;  

     cash paid to employees, suppliers and others;  

     cash paid for interest on our debt; and  

     cash paid or received for taxes.  

Consolidated net cash (used in) provided by our operations was:  

     $(162) million in 2009,  

     $(1.3) billion in 2008 and  

     $635 million in 2007.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

Net cash used in operations decreased $1.1 billion in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to the following:  

     Consolidated cash paid for income taxes decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008.  

     Cash we received from customers in our Forest Products operations excluding Real Estate increased $560 million net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others. This increase was primarily due to:  

       Cash from operations declined as a result of significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

       2008 cash from operations includes 31 weeks of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling and approximately 30 weeks of Australian operations prior to their sales.  

 44     

Table of Contents 

     Cash we received from customers in our Real Estate segment, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $1 million primarily due to fewer closings of single-family home sales and the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

     We received $213 million from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009.  

Alternative Fuel Mixture Credits  

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed a $0.50 per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayers trade or business in 2009. Our application for registration as a blender based on our use of black liquor as an alternative fuel was approved in May 2009. We began blending black liquor (a by-product of our wood pulping process) and diesel fuel during the first week of April 2009 and have blended and used 688 million gallons of the alternative fuel mixture through December 31, 2009. The alternative fuel mixture credit expired on December 31, 2009. We recognized credits of $344 million in 2009  of which we have received $213 million of cash and have recorded a receivable of $131 million  for black liquor blended through December 31, 2009.  

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007  

Net cash from operations decreased $1.9 billion in 2008 as compared with 2007 due to the following:  

     Consolidated cash paid for income taxes increased by  

$981 million primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008.  

     Cash we received from customers in our forest products operations decreased $987 million, which excludes Real Estate, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others. This decrease was primarily due to:  

       Cash from operations declined as a result of significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

       2007 cash from operations includes nine weeks of activity related to the operations that were divested in the Domtar Transaction. There were no cash flows from these operations in 2008.  

       2008 cash from operations includes 31 weeks of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling and approximately 30 weeks of Australian operations prior to their sales. 2007 includes 52 weeks of cash flows from these operations.  

     Cash we received from customers in our Real Estate segment, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $119 million primarily due to fewer closings of single-family home sales and the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS  

Cash from investing activities includes:  

     acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation;  

     investments in or distribution from equity affiliates;  

     proceeds from sale of assets and operations; and  

     purchases and redemptions of short-term investments.  

Three-Year Summary of Capital Spending by Business Segment  Excluding Real Estate  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We anticipate that our net capital expenditures for 2010 excluding acquisitions and our Real Estate business segment  will be approximately $200 million. However, that amount could change due to:  

     future economic conditions,  

     weather and  

     timing of equipment purchases.  

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF NONSTRATEGIC ASSETS  

Proceeds received from the sale of nonstrategic assets over the last three years were:  

     $355 million in 2009 including:  

       $295 million from the sale of nonstrategic timberlands in Oregon and  

       $20 million from the sale of our closed Honolulu box plant.  

     $6.5 billion in 2008 including:  

       $6.1 billion from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

       $342 million from the sale of our Australian operations;  

       $62 million from the sale of certain wood products distribution facilities; and  

       $54 million from the sale of property, equipment and other assets.

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES  

As of December 31, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company has two multi-year revolving credit facility agreements:  

     $400 million revolving credit facility that expires in March 2010 (2010 Facility) and  

     $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility that expires in December 2011 (2011 Facility).  

Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO) is permitted to borrow under only the 2011 Facility.  

On September 14, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company amended its 2011 Facility by entering into a First Amendment to the $1,000,000,000 Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of December 19, 2006. The amendment decreased the amount of minimum defined net worth that Weyerhaeuser Company is required to maintain under the facility from $3.75 billion to $3.0 billion. In addition, the amendment reduced the amount that WRECO is permitted to borrow under the facility to $200 million from $400 million and modified the fees and interest rates payable under the facility. No other changes in the facility were made and  

$1.0 billion remains available under the facility until December 2011.  

Also on September 14, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company amended its 2010 Facility by entering into a First Amendment to the $1,200,000,000 Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of December 19, 2006. The amendment decreased the amount of minimum defined net worth that Weyerhaeuser Company is required to maintain under the facility from $3.75 billion to $3.0 billion. In addition, the amendment reduced the size of the facility to $400 million from $1.2 billion, removed WRECO as a borrower under the facility and modified the fees and interest rates payable under the facility. No other changes in the facility were made and $400 million remains available under the facility until March 2010.  

Neither Weyerhaeuser Company nor WRECO is a guarantor of the borrowing of the other under either of the credit facilities.  

As of December 31, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company and WRECO:  

     had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities,  

     had $33 million in letters of credit issued against the 2011 facility and  

     were in compliance with the credit facility covenants.  

We had no borrowings at any time under our available credit facilities during 2009. Our net borrowings (pay-downs) under our available credit facilities were:  

     $(452) million during 2008 and  

     $664 million during 2007.

CREDIT RATINGS  

On June 22, 2009, Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) changed the trend on the ratings for our debt to Negative from Stable, including our Issuer Rating of BBB (high). 

On September 3, 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded ratings for our debt to BB+ from BBB-.  

Following the December 15, 2009 announcement of the Companys intention to elect REIT status, Moodys Investor Services affirmed the rating of the companys long term debt at Ba1 but changed the outlook from Stable to Developing.  

On December 16, 2009, Standard and Poors affirmed the rating at BBB- but changed their outlook to Negative.  

STOCK OPTION EXERCISES  

Our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were:  

     $0 million in 2009,  

     $4 million in 2008 and  

     $321 million in 2007. 

We did not recognize any excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options during 2009 or 2008. We recognized $51 million in 2007 due to the high volume of stock options exercised when the price of our common stock reached record highs during the first quarter of that year.  

PAYING DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASING STOCK  

We paid dividends of:  

     $127 million in 2009,  

     $507 million in 2008 and  

     $531 million in 2007.  

Changes in the amount of dividends we paid were primarily due to the decrease in our quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 25 cents in December 2008 and to 5 cents in July 2009. 

In December of 2008, the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $250 million of the companys outstanding shares. During 2009, we repurchased 66,691 shares of common stock at a cost of $2 million under the stock-repurchase program.  

During 2007, we completed the stock-repurchase program that was announced in October 2005, which authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Of the 18 million shares repurchased, 7 million shares were repurchased in 2007 at a net cost of $473 million.  

During 2007, we also redeemed 25 million shares in connection with the Domtar Transaction.  

In 2009 and 2008, we paid a dividend, but we had negative cash from operations. This resulted in a negative dividend-payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio for 2007 was 84 percent.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.  

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:  

     historical experience and  

     assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.  

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.  

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:  

     pension and postretirement benefit plans;  

     potential impairments of long-lived assets;  

     legal, environmental and product liability reserves; and  

     depletion accounting.  

Details about our other significant accounting policies  what we use and how we estimate  are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 48     

Table of Contents 

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:  

     discount rate,  

     expected long-term rate of return,  

     anticipated trends in health care costs,  

     assumed increases in salaries and  

     mortality rates.  

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:  

     actual pension fund performance,  

     level of lump sum distributions,  

     plan changes,  

     changes in plan participation or coverage and  

     portfolio changes and restructuring.  

This section provides more information about our:  

     expected long-term rate of return,  

     discount rate and  

     cash contributions.  

Expected Long-Term Rate of Returns  

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. After considering all available information at the end of 2009, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.5 percent. Factors we considered include:  

     the 15.3 percent net compounded annual return achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy over the past 25 years and  

     current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.  

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:  

     $20 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and  

     $3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.  

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.  

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long- term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.  

Discount Rate  

Our discount rate as of December 31, 2009, is:  

     5.9 percent for our U.S. pensions plans  compared with 6.3 percent at December 31, 2008;  

     5.2 percent for our U.S. postretirement plans  compared with 6.3 percent at December 31, 2008;  

     6.1 percent for our Canadian pension plans  compared with 7.3 percent at December 31, 2008; and  

     6.0 percent for our Canadian postretirement plans  compared with 7.3 percent at December 31, 2008.  

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.  

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2010 will be based on the 5.9 and 5.2 percent assumed discount rates for U.S. plans and the 6.1 percent and 6.0 percent assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.  

Our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:  

     $15 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and  

     $3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.  

Contributions Made and Benefits Paid  

During 2009:  

     We were not required to and did not make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plans.  

     We contributed approximately $27 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.  

     We contributed approximately $7 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans in accordance with minimum funding rules in accordance with the respective provincial regulations. We also chose to make voluntary contributions of approximately $27 million to our largest registered plan during 2009. 

     We made benefit payments of approximately $52 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K    49 

Table of Contents 

During 2010:  

We intend to make a voluntary contribution of approximately $100 million to the U.S. qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year. The contribution will be made prior to September 15, 2010. The contribution will decrease 2009 taxable income, thereby increasing the amount of the 2009 net operating loss refund. It would also decrease the earnings and profits required for a real estate investment trust conversion. This contribution is expected to eliminate the estimated $30 million minimum funding requirements for this plan for 2010 which would have been due by September 15, 2011.  

In addition:  

     We expect to be required to contribute $10 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans. We voluntarily contributed $15 million subsequent to December 31, 2009 and may elect to make additional contributions to our largest registered plan in Canada.  

     We expect to contribute $20 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.  

     We expect to make benefit payments of $60 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.  

Receivable From Pension Trust  

During 2009 and 2008, there was a high volume of lump-sum distributions from our U.S. qualified pension plans. Retirement-eligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump-sum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans provisions. In addition, market events during the same period, adversely affected liquidity. For instance, many of the funds in which plan assets are invested changed their redemption terms which delayed some of the pension trusts cash receipts. To avoid liquidating assets at depressed prices and, as permitted by law, we elected to provide $285 million of short-term liquidity to the U.S. pension trust through short-term loans. These short-term loans were made in fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. Markets and liquidity improved in 2009 and the pension trust repaid $139 million in fourth quarter 2009. Full repayment of the remaining balance is anticipated in 2010.  

LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our books.  

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is less than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets.  

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:  

     future cash flows,  

     residual values and  

     fair values of the assets.  

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:  

     probability of alternative outcomes,  

     product pricing,  

     raw material costs,  

     product sales and  

     discount rate.  

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: REAL ESTATE  

Ordinarily, we review homebuilding long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We recorded long-lived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders of $261 million in 2009, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $170 million in 2007.  

Real Estate Held for Development  

Real estate held for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities (MPCs). MPCs typically include several product segments such as residential, active adult, retail and commercial. We evaluate impairment at the subdivision or MPC product segment level. Factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or MPC product segment for impairment include:  

     gross margins and selling costs on homes closed in recent months;  

     projected gross margins and selling costs based on our operating budgets;  

     competitor pricing and incentives in the same or nearby communities; and  

     trends in average selling prices, discounts, incentives, sales velocity and cancellations.  

We update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and MPC product segment that may be impaired. The undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by community-specific factors that include:  

     estimates and timing of future revenues;  

     estimates and timing of future land development, materials, labor and contractor costs;  

 50     

Table of Contents 

     community location and desirability, including availability of schools, retail, mass transit and other services;  

     local economic and demographic trends regarding employment, new jobs and taxes;  

     competitor presence, product types, future competition, pricing, incentives and discounts; and  

     land availability, number of lots we own or control, entitlement restrictions and alternative uses.  

The carrying amount of each subdivision and MPC product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or MPC product segment. An impairment charge for a subdivision or MPC product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot.  

Real Estate Held for Sale  

Real estate held for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell. We regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans.  

The carrying amount of real estate held for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount. The fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions, demographic factors and competitor actions, and is inherently uncertain. Actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates. The carrying amount of real estate held for sale is evaluated quarterly.  

Market Approach  

We use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate held for development and held for sale when information for comparable assets is available. This approach is commonly used for our active projects where we are selling product. We typically use:  

     sales prices for comparable assets,  

     market studies,  

     appraisals or  

     legitimate offers.  

Income Approach  

We generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. Discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in year-to-date 2009 ranged from 12 percent to 25 percent. The income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts.  

LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES  

We record contingent liabilities when:  

     it becomes probable that we will have to make financial payments and  

     the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

Legal Matters  

Determining our liabilities for legal matters requires projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility. We base our projections on:  

     historical experience and  

     recommendations of legal counsel.  

While we do our best in developing our projections, litigation is still inherently unpredictable. Details about our legal exposures and proceedings are discussed in Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These exposures and proceedings are significant. Ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year.  

Environmental Matters  

Determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. We base our estimates on:  

     detailed evaluations of relevant environmental regulations;  

     physical and risk assessments of our affected sites;  

     assumptions of probable financial participation by other known potentially responsible parties; and  

     amounts that we will receive from insurance carriers  though the amounts are not recorded until we have a binding agreement.  

Product Liability Matters  

We record reserves for contingent product-liability matters when it becomes probable we will make financial payment. Determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claim rates and amounts.

Table of Contents 

DEPLETION  

We record depletion  the costs attributed to timber harvested  as trees are harvested.  

To calculate our depletion rate, which is updated annually, we:  

     take the total cost of the timber, minus previously recorded depletion; and  

     divide by the total timber volume estimated to be harvested during the harvest cycle.  

Estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors:  

     changes in weather patterns,  

     effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications,  

     changes in environmental regulations and restrictions,  

     limits on harvesting certain timberlands,  

     changes in harvest plans,  

     scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology and  

     changes in harvest cycles.  

In addition, the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.  

Depletion-rate calculations do not include estimates for:  

     future silviculture  or sustainable forest management  costs associated with existing stands;  

     future reforestation costs associated with a stands final harvest; and  

     future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
