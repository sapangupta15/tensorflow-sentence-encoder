Embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active, and sometimes sole, component. A microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, non-volatile program memory, random access memory for data storage and various input/output peripheral capabilities. In addition to the microcontroller, a complete embedded control system incorporates application-specific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers, non-volatile memory components such as EEPROMs, and various analog and interface products. 

The increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market at approximately $14 billion in calendar year 2008. Microcontrollers are currently available in 4-bit through 32-bit architectures. 4-bit microcontrollers are the smallest segment of the microcontroller market and have been in decline for several years. 8-bit microcontrollers remain very cost-effective for a wide range of high volume embedded control applications and, as a result, continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market. 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications. 

Our Products 

Our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions, including: 

      ·   microcontrollers     

      ·   development tools     

      ·   analog and interface products     

      ·   memory products     

We provide highly cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, low voltage/power operation and ease of development, enabling timely and cost-effective embedded control product integration by our customers. 

Microcontrollers 

We offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring our unique, proprietary architecture marketed under the PIC brand name. We believe that our PIC product family is a price/performance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market. We have shipped over 7 billion PIC microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990. Our PIC products are designed for applications requiring field programmability, high performance, low power and cost effectiveness. They feature a variety of memory technology configurations, low voltage and power, small footprint and ease of use. Our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways, referred to as a Harvard dual-bus architecture; a Reduced Instruction Set Computer, referred to as RISC; and variable length instructions; all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative single-bus, Complex Instruction Set Computer architectures, referred to as CISC. With approximately 600 microcontrollers in our product portfolio, we target the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontroller markets. 

Digital Signal Controllers (DSC) are a subset of our 16-bit microcontroller offering. Our dsPIC Digital Signal Controller families integrate the control features of high-performance 16-bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications. Our dsPIC product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools, software application libraries, development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle. With its field-re-programmability, large selection of peripheral functions, small footprint and ease of use, we believe that our dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers enlarge our addressable market. 

We have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our PIC family of microcontroller products. Our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced, low-cost user programmability feature by incorporating non-volatile memory, such as Flash, EEPROM and EPROM Memory, into the microcontroller, and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings.

Development Tools 

We offer a comprehensive set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools. These tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a PIC microcontroller and dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers for specific applications and, we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins. 

Our family of development tools for PIC and dsPIC devices operates in the standard Windows® environment on standard PC hardware. These tools range from entry-level systems, which include an assembler and programmer or in-circuit debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation hardware. Customers moving from entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future PIC devices since all of our PIC and dsPIC development tools share the same integrated development environment. 

Many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture. Currently, there are approximately 200 third-party tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture. 

We believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and third-party development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products. These development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our standard microcontrollers. To date, we have shipped more than 750,000 development tools. 

Analog and Interface Products 

Our analog and interface products consist of several families with over 550 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management and interface products. At the end of fiscal 2009, our mixed-signal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 13,100 end customers. 

We continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base, which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy, as well as to new customers. In addition to our “attach” strategy, we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional PIC microcontroller and memory products customer base. We market these, and all of our products, based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions. 

Memory Products 

Our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read-only memory, referred to as Serial EEPROMs. We sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market, and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide. Serial EEPROM products are used for non-volatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods. Serial EEPROMs have a very low I/O pin requirement, permitting production of very small devices. 

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test. The ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry. By owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields. Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles. This control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin. 

Our manufacturing facilities are located in: 

      ·   Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2)     

      ·   Chandler, Arizona (probe operations)     

      ·   Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4)     

      ·   Bangkok, Thailand (assembly, probe and test)     

Wafer Fabrication 

Fab 2 currently produces 8-inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 0.35 to 5.0 microns. During fiscal 2008 and the first half of fiscal 2009, Fab 2 operated at approximately 99% of its capacity. In response to lower demand in the second half of fiscal 2009, we reduced the production levels of Fab 2 to about 60% of capacity. Operating at lower percentages of capacity has a negative impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing. 

5 

We acquired Fab 4 in August 2002 and began production in October 2003. Fab 4 currently produces 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.22 to 0.5 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 0.18 microns. Similar to Fab 2, Fab 4 was operating at about 100% of its active capacity during the first half of fiscal 2009. We reduced the production levels of Fab 4 in the second half of fiscal 2009 to about 60% of its active capacity. A significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment acquired with Fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs. We believe the combined capacity of Fab 2 and Fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures. 

We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs. We believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive. 

We outsource a small percentage of our wafer production requirements to third-party wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities. 

Assembly and Test 

We perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand. As of March 31, 2009, approximately 77% of our assembly requirements were being performed in our Thailand facility. As of March 31, 2009, our Thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production. We use third-party assembly and test contractors in several Asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements. 

During fiscal 2009, we completed certain projects to increase capacity at our assembly and test operation in Thailand. Due to lower demand in the second half of fiscal 2009, we are currently operating at levels significantly below the total operating capacity of our Thailand facility. 

General Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations 

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products. We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs. While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products. This allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly. Our engineers utilize advanced Computer Aided Design tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently. 

Due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results. Our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities. Our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control, extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment. Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results. The manufacture of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices, such as those that we produce, are complex processes. These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels. 

Historically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules. In order to respond to such requirements, we must maintain a significant work in process and finished goods inventory. 

At the end of fiscal 2009, we owned identifiable long-lived assets (consisting of property, plant and equipment) in the United States amounting to $368.1 million and $163.6 million in other countries, including $152.4 million in Thailand. At the end of fiscal 2008, we owned identifiable long-lived assets in the United States amounting to $400.6 million and $121.7 million in other countries, including $113.1 million in Thailand. 

Research and Development (R&D) 

We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. Our current R&D activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, Serial EEPROM memory, analog and interface products, new development systems, software and application-specific software libraries. We are also developing new design and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products. 

6 

In fiscal 2009, our R&D expenses were $115.5 million, compared to $120.9 million in fiscal 2008 and $113.7 million in fiscal 2007. R&D expenses included $10.9 million in fiscal 2009, $10.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $9.6 million in fiscal 2007 of share-based compensation as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). 

Sales and Distribution 

General 

We market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. 

Our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. Many of our field sales engineers (FSEs), field application engineers (FAEs), and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments. We believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. The primary mission of our FAE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team. FAEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world. 

Distribution 

Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel. 

In each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, we derived 64% of our net sales through distributors and 36% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by Microchip. In fiscal 2007, we derived 65% of our net sales through distributors and 35% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by Microchip. Our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and 11% of our net sales in fiscal 2007. A second distributor accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2007. No other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. 

We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns. 

Sales by Geography 

Sales by geography for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and 74% of our net sales in fiscal 2007. Our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in Asia and Europe, which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial control products. Americas sales include sales to customers in the United States, Canada, Central America and South America. 

Sales to customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 23% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and 18% of our net sales in fiscal 2007. In each of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, sales to customers in Taiwan accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales. We did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. 

7 

Our international sales are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. Although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions, we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions. 

The semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand. Since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales, our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. In recent periods, adverse global economic conditions and weakness in the housing market have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality, and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business. 

Backlog 

As of April 30, 2009, our backlog was approximately $135.5 million, compared to $225.7 million as of April 30, 2008. Our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months. 

We primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order. Our business and, to a large extent, that of the entire semiconductor industry, is characterized by short-term orders and shipment schedules. Orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules, or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty. Thus, while backlog is useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period. 

Competition 

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Furthermore, recent adverse economic conditions have resulted in a current over capacity in the semiconductor industry and excess capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect market pricing and our competitive position. 

We currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products, including the following product characteristics: 

      ·   speed     

      ·   functionality     

      ·   density     

      ·   power consumption     

      ·   reliability     

      ·   packaging alternatives     

We believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include: 

      ·   ease of use     

      ·   functionality of application development systems     

      ·   dependable delivery, quality and availability     

      ·   technical service and support     

      ·   price     

We believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors, but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business. 

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks 

We maintain a portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents, expiring on various dates between 2009 and 2027. We also have numerous additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. We do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business. While we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments, rather than on our patents. Our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. 

8 

We have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies. We investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate. Based on industry practice, we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms, but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms, that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of infringement claims, could harm our business. 

Environmental Regulation 

We must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes. Our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations. Any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities. 

Increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations. While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2009, we had 4,895 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization. We have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good.
