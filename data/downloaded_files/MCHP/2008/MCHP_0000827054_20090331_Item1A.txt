Item 1A.   RISK FACTORS     

When evaluating Microchip and its business, you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below, in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Our operating results have been adversely impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate due to a number of other factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability. 

Our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the factors that may affect our operating results include: 

      ·   changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers;     

      ·   levels of inventories at our customers;     

      ·   the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory;     

      ·   changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields;     

      ·   our ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity;     

      ·   availability of raw materials and equipment;     

      ·   competitive developments including pricing pressures;     

      ·   the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter;     

      ·   the level of sell-through of our products through distribution;     

      ·   fluctuations in the mix of products;     

      ·   changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;     

      ·   constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers;     

      ·   costs and outcomes of any current or future tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual property, customers or other issues;     

      ·   changes in tax regulations and policies in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business;     

      ·   disruptions in our business or our customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, worldwide oil prices and supply, public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system;     

      ·   property damage or other losses, whether or not covered by insurance; and     

      ·   general economic, industry or political conditions in the U.S. or internationally.      

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance. In future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. The recent downturn in global economic conditions has adversely impacted our operating results and makes comparability between periods less meaningful. 

Our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields. 

The manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices such as those that we produce, are complex processes. These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used, the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment, and other quality issues. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels. This could include delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, and customer-imposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines. Our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity. In the quarter ended March 31, 2009, we reduced wafer starts in both Fab 2 and Fab 4, implemented rotating unpaid time off and had, and continue to have, multiple planned shutdowns in our Thailand facility. These actions were implemented to help control inventory levels in response to current and expected adverse economic conditions. This lower capacity utilization resulted in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins. We are unable to predict when we will be able to return to more optimal levels of capacity utilization. 

10 

We are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments. 

Our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter, which we refer to as turns orders. We measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter. Historically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules. Shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments. Turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times. Because turns orders are difficult to predict, varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast. If we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets, our revenue and operating results may suffer. For example, in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we and the semiconductor industry in general did not achieve the level of turns orders required to meet our targets which adversely impacted our revenue and results of operations for the December quarter. 

Intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced sales of our products or reduced market share. 

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control, including, but not limited to: 

      ·   the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products;     

      ·   our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies;     

      ·   the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own applications;     

      ·   product introductions by our competitors;     

      ·   the number, nature and success of our competitors in a given market;     

      ·   our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices;     

      ·   our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights;     

      ·   our ability to address the needs of our customers; and     

      ·   general market and economic conditions.     

Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. The overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant, while average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM and non-proprietary analog and interface products have declined over time. 

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines, due primarily to competitive conditions. We have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. We have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience in the future, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our Serial EEPROM and non-proprietary analog products. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely impact our operating results. 

Our business is dependent on selling through distributors. 

Sales through distributors accounted for approximately 64% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and approximately 65% of net sales in fiscal 2007. Our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, approximately 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 11% of our net sales in fiscal 2007. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice. 

Continued adverse conditions in the U.S. and global economies and in the U.S. and global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors. Any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation. In addition, during an industry and/or economic downturn, it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sell-through of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns. 

11 

Recent credit and equity market conditions have adversely impacted our holdings of auction rate securities, investments and trading securities which has had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 

At March 31, 2009, $46.8 million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in auction rate securities (ARS). Historically, the carrying value of ARS approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates. With the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets, our ARS have experienced multiple failed auctions. As a result, we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful. In November 2008, we executed an ARS rights agreement (the Rights) with the broker through which we purchased $31.9 million of our ARS that provides (1) us with the right to put these ARS back to the broker at par anytime during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012, and (2) the broker with the right to purchase or sell the ARS at par on our behalf anytime through July 2, 2012. We accounted for the acceptance of the Rights as the receipt of a put option for no consideration and recognized a gain with a corresponding recognition as a long-term investment. We elected to measure the Rights under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 and will record changes in the fair value of the Rights in earnings. We simultaneously recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $5.5 million as we no longer intend to hold the ARS to a time where the fair value recovers, which was recorded in other comprehensive loss in prior quarters. We have reclassified the ARS from available-for-sale to trading securities and future changes in fair value will be recorded in earnings. We expect any future changes in the fair value of the ARS to be largely offset by changes in the fair value of the related Rights without any significant net impact to our income statement. We will continue to measure the ARS and the Rights at fair value (utilizing Level 3 inputs) until the earlier of their maturity or exercise. 

The fair value of our failed ARS has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions. Based on the estimated values, we concluded these investments were other than temporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge on these investments of $2.4 million during fiscal 2008 and $3.6 million during fiscal 2009. If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further, we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings. 

The substantial majority of our short and long-term investments are in highly rated government agency bonds and municipal bonds. Other than with respect to our holdings of ARS, we have not experienced any liquidity or impairment issues with such investments. However, the credit markets have continued to be highly volatile and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not in the future adversely affect the liquidity or value of our investments in government agency bonds or municipal bonds. 

Our investment in marketable equity securities at March 31, 2009 consisted of shares of common stock, the value of which is determined by the closing prices of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of the balance sheet date. These investments are classified as trading securities and accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The market value of these investments was approximately $79.5 million at March 31, 2009 compared to our cost basis of approximately $85.5 million. The value of our investments in marketable equity securities would be materially impacted if there were a significant change in the market price of the shares. Additionally, we have sold put options on some of our trading securities, which are recorded as accrued liabilities, and are marked to market value. A decline in the stock price of the underlying security prior to the expiration date of the puts would cause an increase to the liability, which would result in a charge to our results of operations, and could result in the put being exercised by the holder. If the put is exercised by the holder, we could be required to pay up to $11.0 million for additional shares of the common stock, at a price potentially in excess of the then fair market value of the common stock which would result in a charge to our results of operations. As a result, any fluctuations in the value of our marketable securities could result in unexpected fluctuations in our financial results. 

Our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. 

Our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements. The success of our new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but not limited to: 

      ·   proper new product selection;     

      ·   timely completion and introduction of new product designs;     

      ·   availability of development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use; and     

      ·   market acceptance of our customers’ end products.     

12 

Because our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products. In addition, our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance. We may be unable to design, develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis, which could adversely impact our future operating results. 

Our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies. Semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant R&D expenditures. We and other companies in the industry have, from time to time, experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and, consequently, have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries. Our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented. 

We must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense. 

Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management, engineering and other personnel. The competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense. 

We may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business. We have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team.  

We are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us. 

We use several contractors located in Asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. We also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication. Although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources, the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results. 

Our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract. Our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial, operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels, or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption. Further, procurement of required products and services from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts. If these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards, we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all, and such arrangements, if any, may not be on favorable terms to us. In such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing and production costs, decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 

We may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs. 

Our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards. We generally have more than one source for these supplies, but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards. The raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases. We have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts. An interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment, could harm our business. 

Our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry. 

The semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand. Since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales, our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. However, fluctuations in our overall business in certain recent periods, semiconductor industry conditions and adverse global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality, and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business. The industry has also experienced significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product demand and production over-capacity. We have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments. However, we have experienced substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results and expect, in the future, to experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions. In particular, our business and operating results have been adversely impacted by continuing adverse global economic conditions.

13 

We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims. 

We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, contracts and other matters. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources. If we are not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a settlement of a matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, we could incur uninsured liability in any of them, be required to take an appropriate charge to operations, be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes, suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. 

It is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the performance or use of our products. These claims may be due to products’ nonconformance to our specifications, or specifications agreed upon with the customer, changes in our manufacturing processes, and unexpected end customer system issues due to the interaction with our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers. We could incur significant expenses related to such matters, including costs related to writing off the value of inventory of nonconforming products; recalling nonconforming products; providing support services, product replacements, or modification to products; the defense of such claims; diversion of resources from other projects; lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders and unpaid receivables; customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements; and a requirement to pay damages.  

Because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell, these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved. While we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law. We do have liability insurance which covers damages arising out of product defects, but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims. Costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations. 

Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and medical, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to claims if our products, or interactions with our products, cause the system failures. We will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products. 

Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities. 

Our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success. To that end, we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. In addition, our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which can require significant financial and management resources. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us. 

Our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our customers, distributors, or suppliers. 

We regularly review the financial performance of our customers, distributors and suppliers. However, global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our customers, distributors or suppliers. The financial failure of a large customer or distributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in us not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances. 

We do not typically have long-term contracts with our customers. 

We do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers. When we do enter into customer contracts, the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer. Even though we have approximately 63,000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 9% of our total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2009, cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits. 

14 

Further, as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry, we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale. Under these contracts we commit to supply quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates. If we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract, the customer may incur additional production costs, lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule, or quality related issues. Under these contracts, we may be liable for the costs the customer has incurred. While we try to limit such liabilities, if they should arise, there may be a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition. 

Business interruptions could harm our business. 

Operations at any of our facilities, or at any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors, may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control, including work stoppages, power loss, incidents of terrorism or security risk, political instability, public health issues, telecommunications, transportation or other infrastructure failure, fire, earthquake, floods, or other natural disasters. If operations at any of our facilities, or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis. If this occurs, we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms. This could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers. In addition, business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business. 

We are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks. 

Sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales. During each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, approximately 75% of our net sales were made to foreign customers. We purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers. In addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand, which has experienced periods of political uncertainty in the past. We also use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. Substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in Thailand. 

Our reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks, including, but not limited to: 

      ·   political, social and economic instability;     

      ·   public health conditions;     

      ·   trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;     

      ·   import and export license requirements and restrictions;     

      ·   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;     

      ·   employment regulations;     

      ·   disruptions in international transport or delivery;     

      ·   difficulties in collecting receivables;     

      ·   economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us; and     

      ·   potentially adverse tax consequences.     

If any of these risks materialize, our sales could decrease and/or our operating results could suffer. 

Fluctuations in foreign currency could impact our operating results. We use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. 

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption, including but not limited to new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results. We have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions, but such disruptions could still occur and negatively impact our operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.

15 

The occurrence of events for which we are self-insured, or which exceed our insurance limits, may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. 

We have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk; however, we self-insure for some potentially significant risks and obligations. In these circumstances, we have determined that it is more cost effective to self-insure certain risks than to pay the increased premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market after the events of September 11, 2001. The risks and exposures that we self-insure include, but are not limited to, certain property, product defects, political risks, and patent infringement. Should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are self-insured, then our financial condition, result of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected. 

We are subject to stringent environmental regulations, which may force us to incur significant expenses. 

We must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our products and manufacturing processes. Our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations. Such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations. Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. Environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities. 

Over the past few years, there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products. For example, the EU RoHS Directive provided that beginning on July 1, 2006, electronic products sold into Europe were required to meet stringent chemical restrictions, including the absence of lead. Other countries, such as the U.S., China and Korea, have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to those of the EU. These and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture and sell our products. Over the last several years, the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories; the recycling of electronic products; and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packaging materials have expanded significantly. It may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers’ needs, thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability. We may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold inventory that is not saleable as a result of changes to regulations. We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of hazardous substances in our products and energy efficiency measures. 

Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products. 

A significant portion of our sales are made outside of the U.S. through the exporting and re-exporting of products. In addition to local jurisdictions’ export regulations, our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology are subject to Export Administration Regulations (EAR) when exported and re-exported to and from international jurisdictions. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain countries. Non-compliance with EAR or other export regulations can result in penalties including denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and seizure of products. Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to meet our net sales and earnings targets. 

The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

We are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities for fiscal 2002 and later, other than fiscal 2005. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results. 

The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors. 

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: 

      ·   quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating results of other technology companies;     

      ·   actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors;     

      ·   changes in analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or buy/sell recommendations;     

      ·   changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance;     

      ·   general conditions in the semiconductor industry; and     

      ·   global economic and financial conditions.     

In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock. 

16 

In the event we make acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits. 

We may consider strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise. Any transactions that we consider may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business for those transactions that we complete, or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies. 

We have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities. 

As a result of our sale of $1.15 billion of 2.125% junior subordinated convertible debentures in December 2007, we have a substantially greater amount of long-term debt than we have maintained in the past. Our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our debentures or any other future indebtedness that we incur on or before the maturity of the debentures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

Conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their debentures. 

The conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash, shares of common stock or any combination, at our option. If upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash. If the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture, we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of one thousand dollars principal amount (conversion spread). There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share. Any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. 

There will likely be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.  

There will likely be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings, which may have an adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. For example, in May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1), that alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt that allows for either mandatory or optional cash settlements, including our outstanding debentures. FSP APB 14-1 requires the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. Further, FSP APB 14-1 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component as equity, and then accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to result in the “economic interest cost” being reflected in the consolidated statements of income. In issuing FSP APB 14-1, the FASB emphasized that FSP APB 14-1 will be applied to the terms of the instruments as they existed for the time periods presented, therefore, the application of FSP APB 14-1 would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will require retrospective application. We will be required to implement the proposed standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which begins on April 1, 2009. Although FSP APB 14-1 will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it will require us to record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized. In addition, if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity, any unamortized debt discount would result in a loss on extinguishment. As a result, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and earnings per share. These impacts could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of our debentures.

Recently proposed U.S. tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business and financial results. 

Currently, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the U.S. Present U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. President Obama’s administration has recently announced initiatives that would substantially reduce our ability to defer U.S. taxes including, repealing the deferral of U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. If any of these proposals are constituted into legislation, they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.
