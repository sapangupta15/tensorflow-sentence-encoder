       Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

       Legal Matters  

       New Accounting Standards  

       Business Outlook  

       Forward-Looking Statements  

Overview of Business  

The Corporation is a global health and hygiene company with manufacturing facilities in 35 countries and its products are sold in more than 150 countries. The Corporations products are sold under such well-known brands as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. The Corporation has four reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; K-C Professional & Other; and Health Care. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 8, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In managing its global business, the Corporations management believes that developing new and improved products, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long-term success of the Corporation. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors.  

       Product innovationPast results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. The Corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and/or maintain category leadership. In order to introduce new or improved products, the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed. Research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care, tissue, industrial wipers, safety and health care products and nonwoven materials.  

       Competitive environmentPast results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely-advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which   

17  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities.  

The Corporation increased promotional and strategic marketing spending in 2007 and 2008 to support new product introductions, further build brand equity and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the Corporations products in the market. We expect competition to continue to be intense in 2009.  

       Market sharesAchieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance. We hold number 1 or 2 share positions in more than 80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands.  

       Cost controlsTo maintain or improve our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in our business segments. Our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of pulp, oil and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes. Our strategic investments in information systems and partnering with third-party providers of administrative services should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities.  

       Foreign currency and commodity risksAs a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and we are also exposed to changes in commodity prices. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations.  

       Global economic environmentThe Corporations business and financial results continue to be adversely affected by recessions in the United States and throughout the world and volatility in the global financial markets. Although it has become more challenging to predict our results in the near-term, we will continue to focus on executing our Global Business Plan strategies for the long-term health of our businesses. 

Overview of 2008 Results  

The Corporation continued to experience significant raw material cost inflation in 2008.  

       Net sales increased 6.3 percent because of higher net selling prices and sales volumes and favorable currency effects.  

       Operating profit declined 2.6 percent and net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 7.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.  

       The benefits of top-line growth, along with cost savings of $171 million, were more than offset by inflation in key cost components totaling more than $725 million, an increase in strategic marketing spending of about $95 million and higher levels of selling and administrative expenses, mainly to support growth in developing and emerging markets.  

       Cash flow from operations was $2.5 billion, an increase of 3.6 percent.  

Results of Operations and Related Information  

This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2008 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2008 results to 2007, and 2007 results to 2006.

Commentary:   

2008 versus 2007  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Personal care net sales in North America increased about 5 percent due to more than 3 percent higher net selling prices and more than 1 percent higher sales volumes. The higher net selling prices resulted from increases implemented throughout 2008, net of increased promotional activity primarily for Huggies diapers to match competitive actions. Sales volume growth was dampened by the effects of the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 as customers adjusted inventory levels, child care category sales slowed and some consumers traded down to lower-priced product offerings.

PART II  

(Continued)  

In Europe, personal care net sales were even with the prior year as favorable currency effects offset lower sales volumes and net selling prices. Sales volumes of Huggies diapers in the Corporations four core marketsthe U.K., France, Italy and Spaindeclined about 4 percent from the prior year.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased almost 17 percent driven by a more than 10 percent increase in sales volumes. The growth in sales volumes was broad-based, with particular strength throughout Latin America and in South Korea, Russia, Turkey, and China. Increased net selling prices and favorable product mix added about 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively, to the net sales increase. Unfavorable currency effects in South Korea were offset by favorable effects in other countries, primarily in Brazil and Israel.  

       Consumer tissue net sales in North America were even with the prior year as increased net selling prices of more than 6 percent and improved product mix of nearly 1 percent were offset by a sales volume decline of about 7 percent. The higher net selling prices were primarily attributable to price increases for bathroom tissue and paper towels implemented during the first and third quarters in the U.S. List prices for facial tissue were raised late in the third quarter. Sales volumes were down mid-single digits in bathroom tissue and facial tissue and double-digits in paper towels, primarily as a result of the Corporations focus on improving revenue realization. A portion of the overall volume decline is also due to the Corporations decision in late 2007 to shed certain low-margin private label business.  

In Europe, consumer tissue net sales increased almost 4 percent on nearly 3 percent higher net selling prices, a 1 percent improvement in product mix and more than 2 percent favorable currency effects, tempered by a decline in sales volumes of about 2 percent. The lower sales volumes were primarily due to reduced sales of Andrex and Scottex bathroom tissue and Kleenex facial tissue in response to higher net selling prices and a slowdown in category sales, particularly in the U.K.  

Consumer tissue net sales in the developing and emerging markets increased nearly 13 percent. During 2008, the Corporation raised prices in most markets to recover higher raw materials costs and drove improvements in mix with more differentiated, value-added products, strategies that resulted in higher net selling prices of about 10 percent and better product mix of more than 2 percent. Sales volumes were even with last year. For the year, currency effects were neutral as favorable effects earlier in the year were offset by the dramatic changes in currency rates in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

       Economic weakness and rising unemployment levels in North America and Europe began to affect K-C Professionals categories in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, net sales in North America increased nearly 3 percent as increased net selling prices of about 4 percent and improved product mix of over 1 percent were tempered by lower sales volumes. In Europe, net sales of KCP products advanced about 9 percent as increased net selling prices and higher sales volumes contributed nearly 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, to the improvement. Currency effects were about 4 percent favorable versus the prior year.  

       The increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to mid-single digit growth outside North America and a similar advance for medical devices in North America. The price decline was mainly attributable to competitive conditions affecting surgical supplies in North America and Europe.

2007 versus 2006  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       In North America, net sales of personal care products increased nearly 8 percent primarily on the strength of increased sales volumes. Product innovations spurred volume growth, with a double-digit gain for Huggies baby wipes, high single-digit growth for Huggies diapers and mid single-digit increases for the Corporations child care and incontinence care brands. Child care sales volumes benefited from the late third quarter introduction of GoodNites Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts, a unique offering in the youth pants category. Meanwhile, sales volumes of Kotex feminine care products were below year-ago levels. Net selling prices increased about 1 percent.  

Net sales of personal care products in Europe increased about 11 percent, principally due to favorable currency effects. Higher sales volumes of more than 2 percent were offset by lower net selling prices. The sales volume gains reflect higher sales of Huggies diapers and baby wipes across the region, including a more than 2 percent volume gain for Huggies diapers in the four core marketsUnited Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. The lower net selling prices were due to meeting competitive promotional activity.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased nearly 21 percent driven by a more than 13 percent increase in sales volumes. The growth in sales volumes was broad-based, with particular strength throughout most of Latin America and in South Korea, China and Russia. Favorable currency effects, primarily in Australia and Brazil, added about 6 percent to the higher net sales while net selling prices were about even with last year.  

       In North America, net sales of consumer tissue products rose more than 5 percent due to nearly 3 percent higher sales volumes and about 2 percent higher net selling prices. Sales volumes for bathroom tissue and paper towels increased 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on growth for Scott bathroom tissue and Viva paper towels reflecting product improvements for these brands. Net selling prices were impacted by promotional activity, late in the year, in support of product upgrades, including the Corporations improved Cottonelle bathroom tissue, as well as to support facial tissue in anticipation of a seasonal pick-up in sales volumes that had not yet occurred because of a weaker cold and flu season in the fourth quarter of 2007.  

In Europe, net sales of consumer tissue products increased approximately 9 percent, principally due to favorable currency exchange rates. Improved product mix was negated by an overall sales volume decline of about 1 percent that resulted from the Corporations 2006 decision to shed low-margin business following the sale or closure of certain facilities in the region. Sales volume increases for Andrex bathroom tissue and Kleenex facial tissue were not sufficient to offset the withdrawal from the low-margin business. Net selling prices remained about the same as in the prior year.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased more than 12 percent. About half of the increase was due to favorable currency effects. Improved product mix of nearly 3 percent was tempered   

21  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 by lower sales volumes of slightly more than 1 percent. Net selling prices increased almost 5 percent as selling prices were raised during the year in most developing and emerging markets in response to higher raw material costs.  

       Sales volumes for K-C Professional products increased more than 3 percent with double-digit growth in Latin America and 4 percent higher sales volumes in North America led by advances for Kleenex, Scott and Cottonelle washroom brands and Kimtech and WypAll wiper brands. Higher net selling prices added about 1 percent to the increase in net sales and favorable currency effects contributed over 3 percent.  

       The decrease in sales volumes of health care products was mainly attributable to a higher level of sales of face masks in 2006 primarily due to avian flu preparedness and the impact of the Corporations decision in the second half of 2006 to exit the latex exam glove business. During 2007, the Corporation made progress in transitioning customers and users from latex to its higher-margin, clinically-preferred nitrile gloves. Sales of exam gloves improved sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus the third quarter 2007 levels. Nevertheless, the growth in sales of nitrile gloves did not compensate for the drop-off in sales of latex gloves, due in part to supply constraints earlier in 2007 and competitive market conditions. In other areas of the business, sales of medical devices, particularly Ballard respiratory catheters, generated high single-digit improvement.

 (a) Includes higher marketing and general expenses net of the benefit of cost savings achieved.  

 (b) Charges for strategic cost reductions were $47 million lower in 2008 than in 2007.  

Consolidated operating profit decreased $69 million or 2.6 percent from the prior year. Charges for the strategic cost reductions of $60 million for 2008 were $47 million lower than in the prior year. Charges for the strategic cost reductions, discussed later in this MD&A and in Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are not included in the results of the business segments. The effect of higher net sales, primarily due to increased net selling prices, plus approximately $171 million in cost savings were more than offset by significant inflation in key manufacturing cost inputs of more than $725 million, higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to production downtime, of nearly $100 million, increased strategic marketing spending of about $95 million and higher levels of selling and administrative expenses, mainly to support growth in developing and emerging markets. Operating profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 13.1 percent from 14.3 percent last year.  

       Operating profit for the personal care segment increased 5.6 percent as higher net sales and cost savings more than offset raw materials and other cost inflation. In North America, operating profit increased due to the higher net selling prices and cost savings, tempered by materials and other cost inflation, and increased marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit declined as cost savings were more than offset by the lower net selling prices and materials inflation. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased because the higher net selling prices and sales volumes more than offset increased marketing and general expenses.  

       Consumer tissue segment operating profit decreased 14.4 percent. Increased net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by cost inflation, the lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs, including the effect of planned production downtime. Operating profit in North America decreased due to the same factors that affected the overall segment. In Europe, operating profit declined as higher net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by cost inflation. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets was even with the prior year as higher net selling prices were offset by cost inflation, and increased marketing and general expenses to support growth in these regions.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products decreased 10.5 percent because higher net selling prices were more than offset by cost inflation for both wastepaper and virgin fiber and other materials and increased manufacturing costs, including higher maintenance spending.  

       Operating profit for the health care segment decreased 26.7 percent. The benefit of higher sales volumes was more than offset by the lower net selling prices and higher manufacturing cost. In addition to cost inflation, the segment absorbed manufacturing-related costs as part of a plan to reduce inventory and also experienced higher costs related to changes in its manufacturing footprint.

Strategic Cost Reduction Plan  

In July 2005, the Corporation authorized a multi-year plan to further improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North America and Europe.  

The strategic cost reductions commenced in the third quarter of 2005 and were completed by December 31, 2008. The strategic cost reductions resulted in cumulative charges of $880 million before tax or $610 million after tax.  

Since the inception of the strategic cost reductions, a net workforce reduction of 5,800 has occurred. As of December 31, 2008, charges have been recorded related to the cost reduction initiatives for 23 facilities, including 3 facilities which have been closed and are being marketed for sale.  

For the full year of 2008, year-over-year pretax savings of nearly $110 million were realized, bringing the cumulative annual total to approximately $335 million since the plans inception. Including projected year-over-year savings of about $50 million in 2009, total annual savings from the plan are now expected to reach $385 million.  

See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on costs incurred for the plan.  

Other income and (expense), net  

Other income and (expense), net for 2008 includes costs for a legal judgment and the refinancing of the dealer remarketable securities (see Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) partially offset by favorable settlement of a value-added tax matter in Latin America. A gain of $16 million for the settlement of litigation related to prior years operations in Latin America is included in 2007. In addition, currency transaction losses included in this line item were about $5 million higher in 2008 than in 2007.

(Continued)  

Consolidated operating profit increased $514 million or 24.5 percent. Lower charges for the strategic cost reduction plan increased operating profit by $377 million. These charges are not included in the business segments. In addition, cost savings generated by the plan totaled approximately $105 million during 2007. Other factors affecting the comparison with 2006 were savings of nearly $160 million for the Corporations Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere program, higher sales volumes and increased net selling prices. Partially offsetting these improvements were raw materials cost inflation of almost $350 million, increased strategic marketing expenses of about $50 million and higher general and administrative expenses. The increased general and administrative expenses were to a large extent in support of growth in the developing and emerging markets. Operating profit as a percent of net sales increased to 14.3 percent from 12.6 percent in 2006.  

       Operating profit for personal care products increased 19.9 percent. Cost savings and higher sales volumes more than offset raw materials cost inflation, the costs for product improvements and increased general and administrative expenses.  

Operating profit in North America increased nearly 13 percent primarily on the strength of higher sales volumes. Cost savings and slightly higher net selling prices offset the effect of raw materials cost inflation. Increased operating profit in Europe was driven by cost savings and higher sales volumes, despite lower net selling prices. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 25 percent on sales volume growth and cost savings that more than offset increased marketing and general and administrative expenses.  

       Operating profit for consumer tissue products decreased 9.2 percent as higher net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation, the costs for product improvements and higher manufacturing costs.  

In North America, operating profit declined more than 15 percent because higher net selling prices were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation, primarily pulp costs, the costs of product improvements and higher manufacturing costs. Operating profit in Europe increased due to cost savings and favorable currency effects tempered by raw materials cost inflation and higher marketing and general and administrative expenses. In the developing and emerging markets, operating profit declined slightly as net selling price gains were more than offset by increased pulp costs, higher manufacturing costs and increased general and administrative expenses.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products increased 1.3 percent because higher sales volumes, increased net selling prices and cost savings were substantially negated by cost inflation for both virgin fiber and wastepaper.  

       Operating profit for health care products decreased 7.6 percent as the benefits of cost savings and favorable currency effects were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation, primarily for nonwovens, and increased distribution and selling expenses.  

Other income and (expense), net  

Other income and (expense), net for 2007 includes a gain of $16 million for the previously mentioned settlement of litigation in Latin America. Currency transaction losses included in this line item were about $10 million lower in 2007 than in 2006. In addition, gains on dispositions of facilities in 2007, as part of the strategic cost reduction plan, were about $14 million compared with costs of $8 million in 2006.  

Additional Income Statement Commentary  

Synthetic Fuel Partnerships  

As described in Item 8, Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation had minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships. Pretax losses from participation in these partnerships were reported as   

25  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 nonoperating expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. The partnerships were dissolved in 2008 at no cost to the Corporation. The Corporations income tax provision was reduced by $81 million in 2007, compared with $87 million in 2006 resulting from the income tax credits and tax benefits of these investments. Diluted earnings per share benefited by $.03 in 2007 compared with no benefit in 2008. The diluted earnings per share benefit in 2006 was $.04.  

2008 versus 2007  

       Interest expense increased due to a higher average level of debt partially offset by lower average interest rates. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt activity.  

       The Corporations effective income tax rate was 27.0 percent for 2008 compared with 23.2 percent for 2007. The increase was primarily due to: (a) the benefits from the previously mentioned synthetic fuel credits utilized in 2007 that were not available in 2008; (b) favorable settlements in 2007 of tax issues related to prior years; and (c) the reversal of valuation allowances in 2007 on deferred tax assets at certain majority-owned subsidiaries in Latin America based on a sustained improvement in the subsidiaries operating results, partially offset by higher foreign tax credit benefits in 2008.  

       The Corporations share of net income of equity companies declined by $4 million primarily due to lower net income at Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (KCM). While KCM had higher net sales, its operating profit and net income were affected by currency transaction losses in the fourth quarter of 2008 on its more than $300 million of U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities as the Mexican peso weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The currency transaction losses reduced the Corporations share of KCMs net income by approximately $23 million for 2008.  

       Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income increased $11 million versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher returns payable on the redeemable preferred securities issued by the Corporations consolidated financing subsidiary.  

       As a result of the Corporations ongoing share repurchase program, including the Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2008 net income by about $.25 per share. This benefit was partially offset by the higher interest expense associated with the July 2007 debt issuances that funded the ASR program. See Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on the ASR program.  

2007 versus 2006  

       Interest expense increased principally due to a higher average level of debt. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt issued in the third quarter of 2007.  

       The Corporations effective income tax rate was 23.2 percent for 2007 compared with 25.4 percent in 2006. The decrease for 2007 was primarily due to the previously mentioned favorable settlements of tax issues related to prior years and the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets partially offset by lower foreign tax credit benefits in 2007.  

       The Corporations share of net income from equity companies decreased $49 million primarily due to lower net income at KCM. Included in 2006 results was a gain of $46 million from the sale by KCM of its pulp and paper business. The remainder of the decline was due to lower operating profit at KCM as net sales growth did not overcome the effect of higher raw materials costs.  

       Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income increased $33 million primarily due to the minority owners share of the above-mentioned tax benefits at majority-owned subsidiaries.

(Continued)  

       As a result of the Corporations share repurchase program, including the ASR program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2007 net income by $.14 per share. This benefit was mostly offset by the higher interest expense associated with the third quarter 2007 debt issuances that funded the ASR program.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Capital is total debt and redeemable preferred securities plus stockholders equity and minority owners interest in subsidiaries.  

Cash Flow Commentary:  

Cash provided by operations increased $87 million primarily due to lower tax payments in 2008 versus 2007.  

Contractual Obligations:   

The following table presents the Corporations total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Obligations Commentary:  

       Projected interest payments for variable-rate debt were calculated based on the outstanding principal amounts and prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2008.  

       Returns on redeemable preferred securities reflect required return payments through the next seven-year anniversary date by instrument class. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

       The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp and utilities. Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and   

27  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, management believes the Corporations exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.  

       The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the Corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services it has negotiated for delivery.  

The Corporation will fund its defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expects to contribute $530 million to these plans in 2009. This amount is not included in the above table.  

The above table does not include future payments that the Corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, the Corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from approximately $85 million in 2009 to more than $90 million by 2018.  

As of December 31, 2008, the Corporation has accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.  

Deferred taxes, minority owners interests and payments for pension plan benefits are also not included in the table.  

A consolidated financing subsidiary has issued two classes of redeemable preferred securities. The holder of the securities can elect to have the subsidiary redeem the first class in December 2011 and the second class in December 2014 and each seven-year anniversary thereafter. Management currently anticipates that these securities will not be redeemed at the next redemption dates, and therefore they are not included in the above table. In the event that the holder of the securities does elect to have its preferred securities redeemed at the next respective redemption dates, the Corporation would be required to pay approximately $500 million in 2011 and approximately $500 million in 2014. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these securities.  

Investing Commentary:  

       During 2008, the Corporations capital spending of $906 million was within the targeted range of $850 to $950 million.  

       During 2008, the Corporation acquired a personal care business in Trinidad and Tobago; the remaining 50 percent interest in its South African subsidiary, Kimberly-Clark of South Africa (Pty.) Limited; and the remaining 40 percent interest in its Chilean subsidiary, Kimberly-Clark Chile, S.A. The cost of these acquisitions totaled approximately $98 million. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.  

Financing Commentary:  

       At December 31, 2008, total debt and redeemable preferred securities was $7.0 billion compared with $6.5 billion last year end. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of the financing entities described in Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2008, the related loans are classified as debt payable within one year on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation currently anticipates that these loans will be extended prior to their current maturity dates.

       In August 2008, Standard & Poors (S&P) lowered the Corporations long-term credit rating from A+ to A but reaffirmed the short-term commercial paper A1 rating. S&P also removed both the long- and short-term ratings from negative outlook and both ratings are now classified as stable. In August 2008, Moodys Investor Services reaffirmed the Corporations long- and short-term ratings of A2 and P1, respectively, with an outlook of stable.  

       In November 2008, the Corporation issued $500 million 7.5% Notes due November 1, 2018. The Corporation used the net proceeds to reduce borrowings under its commercial paper program.  

       In the fourth quarter of 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation purchased $200 million of dealer remarketable securities that the Corporation had originally issued in the fourth quarter of 2006. The subsidiary issued commercial paper to fund the investment in these securities and intends to hold these securities until the next remarketing date in the fourth quarter of 2009. The investment in these securities by the subsidiary and the Corporations debt obligation for these securities are eliminated in consolidation. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on these securities.  

       At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had a $1.33 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in September 2012. This facility contains a feature that would allow for increasing it to $1.77 billion. The Corporation maintains the revolving credit facility to manage liquidity needs in the event its access to the commercial paper markets is constrained for any reason. The Corporation did not experience any difficulty in issuing commercial paper in 2008 despite the current constrained credit environment in the United States. The Corporation did not borrow any amounts under the revolving credit facility in 2008.  

       During 2008, the Corporation repurchased about 10 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $625 million which was in line with its updated target of $600 million to $650 million. In light of the Corporations estimated contribution of $530 million in 2009 to its defined benefit pension plans, the Corporation does not expect to repurchase any of its common stock in 2009. See the discussion under Critical Accounting Policies later in this MD&A for additional detail regarding Pension Benefits.  

       In 2003, the Venezuelan government enacted currency restrictions, which have affected the ability of the Corporations Venezuelan subsidiary (K-C Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency at the official rate of exchange to pay for imported finished goods. These exchange restrictions have negatively impacted K-C Venezuela because it has had to meet its foreign currency needs from non-government sources at exchange rates substantially unfavorable to the official rate. During 2008, the Corporation recorded its share of pre-tax losses of more than $10 million or about $.02 per share due to currency transactions at other than official exchange rates. At December 31, 2008, K-C Venezuela had cash denominated in bolivars of $94 million. In 2008, K-C Venezuela represented approximately 2 percent of consolidated net sales and consolidated operating profit.  

Management believes that the Corporations ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs in the foreseeable future.  

Variable Interest Entities  

The Corporation has interests in the financing and real estate entities discussed in Item 8, Notes 2, 7 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which are subject to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan Interpretation of ARB 51 (FIN 46(R)). The entities described in Item 8, Notes 2 and 7 are consolidated   

29  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46(R), as are certain of the real estate entities described in Note 12. The nonconsolidated real estate entities do not engage in any of the transactions subject to the disclosure requirements of FRR 67, Disclosure in Managements Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Corporations financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension and other postretirement benefits, retained insurable risks, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets, the qualitative and quantitative analyses of variability used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and loss contingencies. The Corporations critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Promotion and Rebate Accruals  

Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the Corporation and its trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the Corporations products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $321 million and $348 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $261 million and $253 million, respectively.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension Benefits  

The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the United Kingdom have defined benefit pension plans (the Principal Plans) and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in such countries. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded.

PART II  

(Continued)  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $97 million in 2008 compared with $120 million for 2007. Pension expense included incremental costs of about $5 million and $8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, for special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 8.23 percent in 2008 compared with 8.27 percent in 2007 and will be 8.17 percent in 2009. The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. In setting this assumption, the Corporation considers a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class, current asset allocation and historical long-term market performance. As part of the factors related to historical market performance, the Corporation considered the range of compounded annual returns for 15 rolling 15-year and 20-year periods through 2008 relative to each plans current asset allocation.  

The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the Principal Plans was 8.48 percent in 2008 compared with 8.50 percent in 2007 and will be 8.47 percent in 2009. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers, with expected long-term rates of return ranging from 9 to 10 percent, and about 30 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return ranging from 6 to 7 percent. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Long-term rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary.  

Pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. The variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a Calculated Value was used for plan assets. As of December 31, 2008, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $2.2 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions.  

The discount (or settlement) rates used to determine the present values of the Corporations future U.S. and Canadian pension obligations at December 31, 2008 were based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years. Each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rates for the U.S. and Canadian pension obligations. For the U.K. plans, discount rates were established using the yield on a U.K. bond index comprised of high quality corporate debt securities, with the yield adjusted for duration differences between the index and the pension obligations and for securities in the index recently downgraded below high quality. The weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans increased to 6.47 percent at December 31, 2008 from 6.20 percent at December 31, 2007.  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $295 million in 2009. The increase in estimated pension expense for 2009 from $97 million incurred in 2008 reflects substantially lower plan assets at December 31, 2008 and the effect of actuarial losses. The 2009 estimate is based on an expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 8.47 percent, a weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 6.47 percent and various other assumptions. Pension

(Continued)  

 expense beyond 2009 will depend on future investment performance, the Corporations contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.  

If the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $7 million in 2009. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, annual pension expense would increase by approximately $11 million and the December 31, 2008 pension liability would increase by about $133 million.  

The fair value of the assets in the Corporations defined benefit plans was $3.1 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately $1.9 billion and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation contributed about $129 million to its pension plans in 2008 compared with $98 million in 2007. In addition, the Corporation made direct benefit payments of $14 million in 2008 compared to $15 million in 2007. The Corporation currently anticipates contributing about $530 million to its pension plans in 2009.  

The methodology for determining the discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the Corporations consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted-average discount rates.  

Other Postretirement Benefits  

Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and/or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, except that the Corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003.  

The Corporation made benefit payments of $73 million in 2008 compared with $77 million in 2007. The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, 2009 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than $1 million and the December 31, 2008 benefit liability would increase by about $16 million.  

The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the Corporations recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. The annual increase in the consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 7.5 percent in 2009, 6.5 percent in 2010 and to gradually decline to 5.2 percent in 2012 and thereafter. See Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate.  

Retained Insurable Risks  

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and managements judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability, are based upon undiscounted loss development factors.

Property and Depreciation  

Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. The determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probability-weighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk-free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value.  

The estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans, including the strategic cost reduction plan, and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if the Corporations products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and additional impairment charges may be recognized.  

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the Corporations businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices and costs are also tested. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated. If a possible impairment is indicated, the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. The Corporations annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that its $2.7 billion of goodwill is not impaired.  

The Corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately $307 million and a net carrying amount of about $121 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows,   

33  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value (based on discounted future cash flows). Judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above.  

Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)  

The primary beneficiary of variable interest entities is required to be determined under FSP FIN 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), using a qualitative analysis to identify the risks in the VIE that cause variability and then to determine the variability that the VIE is designed to create and pass along to its participants. The participant that absorbs the majority of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE in accordance with FIN 46(R). If the qualitative analysis is inconclusive, a quantitative analysis is required to estimate the probable future cash flows of the VIE using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values; and the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary. Both the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis require the exercise of significant management judgment.  

Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments  

As of December 31, 2008, the Corporation had recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $725 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $305 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $420 million. As of December 31, 2007, the net deferred tax asset was $414 million. These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, the Corporation considers many factors, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

As of December 31, 2008, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $5.6 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non-U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination, as appropriate.  

The Corporation accrues net liabilities for current income taxes for potential assessments, which at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $332 million and $323 million, respectively. The accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the resolution of these positions, in accordance with the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Corporations U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2005. IRS assessments   

34  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 of additional taxes have been paid through 2001. Refund actions are pending with the IRS for the years 1999 through 2005. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

Loss Contingencies  

The outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the Corporation is subject to uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate. Changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies.  

Legal Matters  

The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in managements opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

New Accounting Standards  

See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on the Corporations financial statements.  

Business Outlook  

The unfavorable global economic environment continues to adversely affect the Corporations business and financial results, making it more challenging to predict results in the near-term. The Corporation believes that weakness in foreign currencies and higher pension expense, resulting from negative returns in global equity markets in 2008, will negatively affect the Corporations 2009 results. While commodity costs are anticipated to moderate as compared to 2008, expected weaker currency exchange rates would reduce the potential benefits of lower commodity costs. Based on anticipated economic and competitive conditions, the Corporation expects to generate sufficient improvement in other aspects of its business operations in 2009 to substantially offset the negative effects from the higher pension expense and currency transaction losses. In 2009, the Corporation intends to continue to focus on its marketing and innovation programs. The Corporation also intends to accelerate cost reductions in its operations to improve its competitive position and to continue to focus on its cash flow and financial condition.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K or related documents, a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference, concerning, among other things, the business outlook, including new product introductions, cost savings, anticipated benefits related to the strategic cost reduction plan, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies and anticipated transactions of the Corporation, constitute forward-looking   

35  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Corporation. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the Corporations results will be as estimated.  

The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside the control of the Corporation, including the prices and availability of the Corporations raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the Corporations products, energy costs, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the Corporation does business, could impact the realization of such estimates.  

The factors described under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K, or in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, among others, could cause the Corporations future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Corporation. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.
