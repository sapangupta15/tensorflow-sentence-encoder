ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Electric Sales

SCE&G’s sales of electricity by customer classification as percentages of electric revenues were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for resale include sales to three municipalities in 2017 and 2016. Other includes short-term system sales which during 2017 included sales to two investor-owned utilities or registered marketers. Short-term system sales during 2016 included sales to four investor-owned utilities or registered marketers.

During 2017 SCE&G experienced a net increase of approximately 10,000 electric customers (growth rate of 1.4%), increasing its total electric customers to approximately 719,000 at year end.

The following projections assume normal weather where applicable. For the period 2017 to 2018, SCE&G projects a retail kWh sales increase of approximately 0.4% and customer growth of 1.5%. For the period 2018-2020, SCE&G projects total territorial kWh sales of electricity to increase 0.3% annually, total retail sales to decrease 0.2% annually, total electric customer base to increase 1.5% annually and territorial peak load (summer, in MW) to increase 1.0% annually. SCE&G’s goal is to maintain a planning reserve margin of between 14% and 20%; however, weather and other factors affect territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any given day to fall below the reserve margin goal.

Electric Interconnections

SCE&G purchases all of the electric generation of GENCO’s Williams Station under a unit power sales agreement which has been approved by FERC. Williams Station has a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 605 MW.

SCE&G’s transmission system extends over a large part of the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The system interconnects with Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, Duke Energy Progress, LLC, Santee Cooper, Georgia Power Company and the Southeastern Power Administration’s Clarks Hill (Thurmond) Project. SCE&G is a member of VACAR, one of several geographic divisions within the SERC. SERC is one of eight regional entities with delegated authority from NERC for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards approved by FERC. The regional entities and all members of NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America.

Fuel Costs and Fuel Supply

The average cost of various fuels and the weighted average cost of all fuels (including oil) were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The sources and percentages of total MWh by each category of fuel for the preceding three years and estimates for the next three years follow:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For a listing of the Company's generating facilities, see the Electric Properties section within Item 2. Properties. 

In 2017, coal was primarily obtained through long-term contracts with suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 2.1 million tons annually. Sulfur restrictions on the contract coal range from 1.0% to 1.6%. These contracts expire at various times through 2019. Spot market purchases may occur when needed or when prices are believed to be favorable. The Company relies on unit trains and, in some cases, trucks for coal deliveries. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that electric operations comply with all applicable regulations relating to the discharge of SO2 and NOX. See additional discussion at Environmental Matters in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and WEC are parties to a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, SCE&G supplies enriched products to WEC and WEC supplies nuclear fuel assemblies for Unit 1. WEC is SCE&G’s exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Unit 1 through 2033. 

In addition, SCE&G has contracts covering its nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services and enrichment services. These contracts have varying expiration dates through 2024. SCE&G believes that it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services and that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to allow for normal operations of its nuclear generating unit.

SCE&G stores spent nuclear fuel in its on-site spent-fuel pool, and has constructed a dry cask storage facility to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Unit 1. In addition, Unit 1 has sufficient on-site capacity to permit storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete unloading should become desirable or necessary. For information about the contract with the DOE regarding disposal of spent fuel, see the Environmental section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

SCE&G also uses long-term power purchase agreements to ensure that adequate power supply resources are in place to meet load obligations and reserve requirements. As of January 1, 2018, SCE&G had such agreements in place for 325 MW of capacity (expiring at various times through 2020). In addition, SCE&G had the ability to purchase an additional 204 MW of capacity under these agreements. On December 20, 2017, SCE&G entered into an agreement to purchase the Columbia Energy Center, which is the existing 540 MW combined cycle gas generating station to which these capacity contracts relate. Upon the closing of such purchase, these contracts will be moot, and all output of that station will be available for SCE&G's load obligations and reserve requirements. Also, as of December 31, 2017, SCE&G is taking delivery of utility scale solar generated power pursuant to 17 executed power purchase agreements totaling 218 MW-alternating current.

GAS OPERATIONS

Gas Sales-Regulated

Regulated sales of natural gas by customer classification as a percent of total regulated gas revenues sold or transported were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the period 2018-2020, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in MMBTUs to increase 31.7% annually (excluding transportation and assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in MMBTU sales include residential of 2.5%, commercial of 0.9%, and industrial of 84.8%. Projections of total and industrial sales include amounts for new gas-fired electric generating plants that will be served by PSNC Energy.

For the period 2018-2020, SCE&G projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in MMBTUs to increase 2.2% annually (excluding transportation and assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in MMBTU sales include residential of 2.4%, commercial of 1.0% and industrial of 2.9%.

For the period 2018-2020, each of SCANA’s and SCE&G’s total regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase 2.6% annually. During 2017, SCANA recorded a net increase of approximately 24,000 regulated gas customers (growth rate of 2.6%), increasing the number of its regulated gas customers to approximately 931,000. Of this increase, SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 10,000 gas customers (growth rate of 2.9%), increasing the number of its total gas customers to approximately 368,000 (as of December 31, 2017).

Demand for gas changes primarily due to weather and the price relationship between gas and alternate fuels.

Gas Cost and Supply

 SCE&G purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on both a short-term and long-term basis at market based prices. The gas is delivered to South Carolina through firm transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2019), Transco (expiring at various times through 2084) and DECG (expiring at various times through 2036). The maximum daily volume of gas that SCE&G is entitled to transport under these contracts is 212,194 MMBTU from Southern Natural, 110,458 MMBTU from Transco and 456,427 MMBTU from DECG. Additional natural gas volumes may be delivered to SCE&G’s system as capacity is available through interruptible transportation.

The daily volume of gas that SCANA Energy is entitled to transport under its service agreements (expiring at various times through 2023) on a firm basis is 761,860 MMBTU. Additional natural gas volumes may be delivered as capacity is available through interruptible transportation.

SCE&G purchased natural gas, including fixed transportation, at an average cost of $3.96 per MMBTU during 2017 and $3.46 per MMBTU during 2016.

To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, SCE&G has 5,502,600 MMBTU of natural gas storage capacity on the systems of Southern Natural and Transco. Approximately 3,433,200 MMBTU of gas were in storage on December 31, 2017. SCE&G supplements its supplies of natural gas with two LNG storage facilities, one of which has liquefaction capability. Approximately 1,624,300 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage on December 31, 2017. For a discussion of SCE&G's natural gas storage capacity, see Item 2. Properties.

PSNC Energy purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a short-term basis at market based prices and on a long-term basis for reliability assurance at first of the month index prices plus a reservation charge in certain cases. Transco transports natural gas to North Carolina through transportation agreements with varying expiration dates through 2031. On a peak day, PSNC Energy is capable of receiving daily transportation volumes of natural gas under these contracts, utilizing firm contracts of 710,062 MMBTU from Transco.

PSNC Energy purchased natural gas, including fixed transportation, at an average cost of $4.39 per MMBTU during 2017 compared to $3.73 per MMBTU during 2016.

To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking services. Underground natural gas storage service agreements with Dominion Energy Transmission, Inc., Columbia Gas Transmission, Transco and Enbridge Inc. provide for storage capacity of approximately 13,000,000 MMBTU. Approximately 9,000,000 MMBTU of gas were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2017. PSNC Energy also maintains LNG storage service agreements with Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG which provides 1,300,000 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) of storage space. Approximately 1,200,000 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2017. Approximately 800,000 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at PSNC Energy's LNG storage facility at December 31, 2017. For a discussion of PSNC Energy's LNG storage capacity, see Item 2. Properties. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to accommodate growth.

Gas Marketing-Nonregulated

SCANA Energy markets natural gas and provides energy-related services in the Southeast. In addition, a division of SCANA Energy markets natural gas to greater than 425,000 customers (as of December 31, 2017) in Georgia’s natural gas market.

REGULATION

Regulatory jurisdictions to which SCANA and its subsidiaries are subject are described in the Regulatory Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

SCE&G has obtained FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness and to assume liabilities as a guarantor (pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act). SCE&G may issue unsecured promissory notes, commercial paper and direct loans in amounts not to exceed $1.6 billion outstanding with maturity dates of one year or less, and may enter into guaranty agreements in favor of lenders, bankers, and dealers in commercial paper in amounts not to exceed $600 million. GENCO has obtained FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness not to exceed $200 million outstanding with maturity dates of one year or less. The authority described herein will expire in October 2018. Were adverse developments to occur with respect to uncertainties highlighted elsewhere, the ability of SCE&G or GENCO to secure renewal of this short-term borrowing authority may be adversely impacted.

SCE&G holds licenses under the Federal Power Act for each of its hydroelectric projects. The licenses expire as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* SCE&G operates the Saluda hydroelectric project under an annual license while its long-term re-licensing application is being reviewed by FERC.

At the termination of a license under the Federal Power Act, FERC may extend or issue a new license to the previous licensee, may issue a license to another applicant, or the federal government may take over the related project. If the federal government takes over a project or if FERC issues a license to another applicant, the federal government or the new licensee, as the case may be, must pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project, not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages.

RATE MATTERS

For a discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters section of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Fuel Cost Recovery Procedures

The SCPSC’s fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in SCE&G’s retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any over-collection or under-collection from the preceding 12-month period. The statutory definition of fuel costs includes certain variable environmental costs, such as ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions, and the cost of emission allowances used for SO2, NOX, mercury and particulates. In addition, the statutory definition of fuel cost allows electric utilities to recover avoided costs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, as well as costs incurred as a result of offering DER and net metering programs to its customers. SCE&G may request a formal proceeding concerning its fuel costs at any time. 

Purchased gas cost recovery procedures related to the Company's natural gas operations along with related rate proceedings by the SCPSC and NCUC are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and hazardous waste management. Developments in these areas may require that equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or replaced. The ultimate effect of any new or pending regulations or standards upon existing operations cannot be predicted. For a discussion of how these regulations and standards may impact SCANA and SCE&G (including capital expenditures necessitated thereby), see the Environmental Matters section of Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

OTHER MATTERS

Insurance coverage for Unit 1 is described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
