ITEM 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The notes to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements, primarily Note 2, summarize the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial s tatements and related disclosures. 

Management believes the following are critical accounting policies, the application of which has a material impact on our financial presentation. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Qualification as a REIT – Income Tax Expense: We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, as a qualifying REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state laws. A REIT generally does not pay corporate level federal income taxes on its REIT taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders, and accordingly, we do not pay federal income tax on the share of our REIT taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. 

We therefore do not estimate or accrue any federal income tax expense for income earned and distributed related to REIT operations. This estimate could be incorrect, because due to the complex nature of the REIT qualification requirements, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, we cannot be assured that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT for any particular taxable year. For any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income, whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders. Any resulting requirement to pay corporate in come tax, including any applicable penalties or interest, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also would not be eligible to elect REIT status for any taxable year prior to the fifth taxable year which begins after the first taxable year for which REIT status was terminated. There can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Substantially all of our assets, consisting primarily of real estate, are long-lived assets. The evaluation of our long-lived assets for impairment includes determining whether indicators of impairment exist, which is a subjective process. When any indicators of impairment are found, the evaluation of such long-lived assets then entails projections of future operating cash flows, which also involves significant judgment. Future events, or facts and circumstances that currently exist, that we have not yet identified, could cause us to conclude in the future that our long-lived assets are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our fina ncial condition and results of operations. 

Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets: Substantially all of our assets consist of depreciable or amortizable long-lived assets. We record depreciation and amortization expense with respect to these assets based upon their estimated useful lives. Any change in the estimated useful lives of those assets, caused by functional or economic obsolescence or other factors, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

28 

Accruals for Contingencies: We are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred, but in accordance with GAAP, we have not accrued for certain potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable or because we are not aware of the event. Future events and the results of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Significant unaccrued losses that we have determined are at least reasonably possible are described in Note 13 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial st atements. 

Accruals for Operating Expenses: Certain of our expenses are estimated based upon assumptions regarding past and future trends, such as losses for workers compensation and employee health plans, and estimated claims for our tenant reinsurance program. Our property tax expense represents one of our largest operating expenses totaling approximately $153 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, has significant estimated components. Most notably, in certain jurisdictions we do not receive tax bills for the current fiscal year until after our earnings are finalized, and as a result, we must estimate tax expense based upon anticipated implementation of regulations and trends. If these estimates and assumptions wer e incorrect, our expenses could be misstated. 

Valuation of real estate and intangible assets acquired: In reporting the acquisition of operating self-storage facilities in our financial statements, we must estimate the fair value of the land, buildings, and intangible assets acquired in these transactions. These estimates are based upon many assumptions, subject to a significant degree of judgment, including estimating discount rates, replacement costs of land and buildings, and estimating future cash flows from the tenant base in place at the time of the acquisition. We believe that the assumptions we used were reasonable, however, others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated values, whic h would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, as well as the amounts included on our consolidated balance sheets for real estate and intangible assets. 

Overview of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations 

Our principal business activities include the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of self-storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the U.S., which represents our Domestic Self-Storage segment. A large portion of management time is focused on maximizing revenues and effectively managing expenses at our self-storage facilities, as the Domestic Self-Storage segment contributes 92% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, and is the primary driver of growth in our net income and cash flow from operations. 

The remainder of our operations are comprised of our Europe Self-Storage segment, our Commercial segment, and the operations not allocated to any segment, each of which is described in Note 11 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements. 

The self-storage industry is subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the disposable income and spending of consumers, as well as those that affect moving trends. Due to the recessionary pressures in the U.S., demand for self-storage space has been negatively impacted since the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, rental income in our same store self-storage facilities declined on a year-over-year basis in each quarter of 2009, with a peak decline of 5.1% in the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Rental income trends improved each quarter since the quarter ended September 30, 2009, with reduced levels of year-over-year rental income declines, and in the most recent quarter ended December 31, 2010 rental income increased 2.0%. While trends have been improving, the re can be no assurance that this will continue. 

Another important component of our long-term growth is our access to capital and deployment of that capital. Acquisitions of self-storage facilities were minimal during 2008 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired 42 self-storage facilities for $239.6 million. During January 2011, we acquired five additional facilities for $19.5 million. In February 2011, we acquired the leasehold interest in the land for one of our self-storage facilities for approximately $6.6 million. We believe that there may be opportunities to acquire additional facilities in 2011, because we have seen more facilities come to market and an increase in transaction volume. However, there can be no assurance that the facilities that come to market will be those that we might be interested in acquiring at the prices asked. 

29 

Other investments we have made in the past, and may make in the future include i) the development and redevelopment of self-storage facilities in the U.S., ii) further investment in Shurgard Europe to allow it to develop or acquire facilities, iii) further investment in PS Business Parks, and iv) the early retirement of debt or redemption of preferred securities. There can be no assurance that these other investment alternatives will be attractive in the long-term, or will be even be available as investment alternatives. 

At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $456.2 million of cash and $102.3 million of short-term investments in high-grade corporate securities. We also have access to our $300 million line of credit which does not expire until March 27, 2012. Our capital commitments during the year ended December 31, 2011 of approximately $159.9 million include (i) $133.8 million in principal payments on debt and (ii) $26.1 million for the aforementioned acquisition of facilities and land described above. We have no further significant commitments until 2013, when $265.6 million of existing debt comes due. On February 9, 2011, we loaned PSB $121.0 million which PSB used to re-pay borrowings against their credit facility and repurchase preferred stock. The loan has a six-month term, no prep ayment penalties, and bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.85%. 

Our ability to raise additional capital by issuing our common or preferred securities is dependent upon capital market conditions. Capital markets have improved from the severe stress in late 2008 and early 2009. In October 2010 we issued in aggregate $125 million (face amount) of Series P Cumulative Preferred Shares at a rate of 6.500%. In April and May 2010, we issued in aggregate $145 million (face amount) of Series O Cumulative Preferred Shares at a rate of 6.875%. There can be no assurance that market conditions will continue to permit preferred security issuances at amounts and at rates that we will find reasonable. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on raising capital to fund our operations or meet our obligations. 

Results of Operations  

Operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009: For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $399.2 million or $2.35 per diluted common share, compared to $586.0 million or $3.47 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $186.8 million or $1.12 per diluted common share. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a foreign currency exchange loss of $42.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a $9.7 million gain during the same period in 2009, (ii) an aggregate $35.8 million increase in income allocated to the shareholders of redeemed securities, (including our equity share of PS Business Park’s (“PSB”) redemptions) in applying EITF D- 42 to the redemption of securities in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to a $94.5 million decrease in income allocated to shareholders of redeemed securities (including our equity share of PSB’s redemptions), in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the same period in 2009 and (iii) a gain on disposition of real estate assets of $30.3 million related to an equity offering by PSB recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009. 

Operating results for 2009 as compared to 2008: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $790.5 million compared to $973.9 million for the same period in 2008, representing a decrease of $183.4 million. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a gain of $344.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe, (ii) a $36.4 million reduction in net operating income with respect to our Same Store Facilities described below, and (iii) an impairment charge included in discontinued operations with respect to intangible assets totaling $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by (iv) a $49.9 million reduction in depreciation and amortization related to our domesti c assets, primarily representing reduced intangible amortization, (v) a foreign exchange gain of $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a loss of $25.4 million during the same period in 2008, (vi) a gain on disposition of $30.3 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009 related to an equity offering by PSB, and (vii) a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to $27.9 million in incentive compensation incurred in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe.

Real Estate Operations  

Self-Storage Operations: Our self-storage operations are by far the largest component of our operating activities, representing more than 90% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

To enhance year-over-year comparisons, the table that follows summarizes, and the ensuing discussion describes, the operating results of three groups of facilities that management analyzes: (i) the Same Store facilities, representing the facilities in the Domestic Self-Storage Segment that we have owned and have been operating on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2008, (ii) all other facilities in the Domestic Self-Storage Segment, which are primarily those consolidated facilities that we have not owned and operated at a stabilized basis since January 1, 2008 such as newly acquired, newly developed, or recently expanded facilities, and (iii), the Shurgard Europe facilities, which we deconsolidated effective March 31, 2008 in connection with the sale of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe to an institutional investor (the 8220;Europe Transaction”). 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

      (a)   Represents the results with respect to Shurgard Europe’s facilities for the periods consolidated in our financial statements. As described in Note 3 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements, effective March 31, 2008, we deconsolidated Shurgard Europe. See also “Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Entities – Investment in Shurgard Europe” for further analysis of the historical same store property operations of Shurgard Europe.    

31 

      (b)   See “Net Operating Income or NOI” below.    

Net income with respect to our self-storage operations increased by $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009. This was due to a $21.7 million increase in revenues with respect to the Other Facilities due primarily to the acquisition of 42 facilities during 2010, partially offset by increased amortization of tenant intangible assets at these 42 facilities. Net income with respect to our self-storage operations increased by $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, when compared to the same period in 2008. This was due to a) declining amortization of tenant intangible assets acquired in the merger with Shurgard in 2006, b) a 1.9% reduction in cost of operations for the Same Store facilities, and c) a $11.3 million incr ease in revenues with respect to the Other Facilities, offset by d) a 3.1% decrease in revenues for our Same Store facilities and e) the deconsolidation of the facilities owned by Shurgard Europe effective April 1, 2008. 

      Net Operating Income    

We refer herein to net operating income (“NOI”) of our self-storage facilities, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Although depreciation and amortization are a component of GAAP net income, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, property performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense as it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization o r net income in evaluating our operating results. The following reconciles NOI generated by our self-storage segment to our consolidated net income in our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements.

Same Store Facilities 

The “Same Store Facilities” represents those 1,925 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2008 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2008, 2009, and 2010. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,925 facilities (120.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. “Other costs of management” included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities.    

  b)    See “Net Operating Income” above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our net income in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.    

  c)    Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.    

  d)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income (which excludes late charges and administrative fees) by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other items that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due.    

  e)    Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF. Exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are charged upon move-in volumes and are therefore dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period.    

34 

  f)    Realized annual rent per available foot or “REVPAF” is computed by dividing rental income (which excludes late charges and administrative fees) by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.    

  g)    In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees.    

Revenues generated by our Same Store facilities increased by 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to increased late payment charges and administrative fees charged to new tenants. Rental income was flat on a year-over-year basis as average occupancy was 1.2% higher, offset by a 1.2% reduction in average realized annual rental rates per occupied square foot. 

Revenues generated by our Same Store facilities decreased approximately 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008. This decrease was caused by a 3.5% reduction in rental income, partially offset by a 7.5% increase in late charges and administrative fees. Rental income decreased due to a combination of (i) a 2.7% reduction in average realized annual rental rates per occupied square foot and (ii) 0.9% reduction in average occupancy levels. 

Our operating strategy is to maintain occupancy levels for our Same Store facilities at approximately 89% to 90% throughout the year. In order to achieve this strategy, we adjust rental rates and promotional discounts offered to new tenants as well as the frequency of television advertising, increasing or decreasing each, depending on traffic patterns of new tenants renting space offset by existing tenants vacating. We experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months. Consequently, rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months. 

We believe overall demand for self-storage space in virtually all of the markets in which we operate has been negatively impacted since late 2008 due to recessionary pressures, including increased unemployment, reduced housing sales, and reduced moving activity, in the major markets in which we operate. Occupancy levels dropped abnormally in the fourth quarter of 2008. We immediately reduced rental rates and increased promotional discounts to stimulate move-in activity and regain occupancy. These actions continued throughout 2009 and helped stabilized our occupancy levels, however, monthly occupancy levels throughout 2009 remained below comparable periods in 2008. In 2010, occupancy levels began to improve. Throughout 2010, monthly occupancy levels exceeded those experienced in 20 09 and beginning in April 2010, exceeded those experienced in 2008. Although our occupancy has been higher in 2010 compared to 2009, reduced rental rates and increased promotional discounts offset the effect of these improved occupancy levels on our revenue. As a result, our rental income has decreased on a year-over-year basis in each quarter in 2009 and in the first two quarters of 2010. Beginning in the second quarter of 2010, our occupancies exceeded the occupancy levels of 2008. These decreases peaked in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 at 5.1%, however the decreases have abated progressively each quarter since then, and rental income increased 2.0% in the quarter ended December 31, 2010. 

The following chart sets forth our rental income, occupancy, and realized rent per square foot trends in our same-store facilities in 2009 and 2010: 

35 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Notwithstanding our increases in occupancy in 2010, we will continue to be competitive in our pricing and discounting in order to compete with other operators to attract new incoming tenants. We expect to be more aggressive in increasing rental rates to existing tenants in 2011 as compared to 2010. We expect the improved operating trends that have been experienced in the last year to continue in the quarter ending March 31, 2011. 

From a geographic standpoint, we experienced the greatest year-over-year revenue declines in our Southeast markets, located in North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, as well as the West Coast, which includes Washington, Oregon and California. See Analysis of Regional Trends table that follows. 

Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 0.7% in 2010, as compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily to increases in repairs and maintenance and direct property payroll, offset by a reduction in media advertising and lower property tax expense. Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by 1.9% in 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was due to reduced utilities, repairs and maintenance, telephone reservation center, and property insurance which were offset in part by increases in property taxes and other advertising and promotion expenses. 

Property tax expense decreased 1.1% in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to reduced assessments of property values combined with an increase in refunds associated with appeals for prior years’ tax liabilities that were experienced in Texas, Illinois, New York, Virginia and Florida. Property tax expense increased 2.7% in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to increases in tax rates combined with increases in assessments of property values. We expect property tax expense growth of approximately 3.0% in 2011. 

Direct property payroll expense increased by 2.1% in 2010, as compared to 2009, and was flat in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 reflects higher incentive costs for our property personnel. For 2011, we expect moderate growth in direct property payroll. 

Media advertising for the Same Store Facilities decreased by 27.1% in 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, and decreased by 1.0% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in 2010 was due primarily to a reduction in television advertising costs as we decreased the number of markets in which we advertised. Media advertising primarily includes the cost of advertising on television and varies depending on a number of factors, including our occupancy levels and demand for storage space. 

36 

Other advertising and promotion is comprised principally of yellow page and Internet advertising, which increased 7.0% in 2010 as compared to 2009, and 10.2% during 2009 as compared to 2008. These increases are due primarily to higher Internet advertising expenditures offset partially by lower yellow page advertising. During 2010, we invested extensively to improve our positioning on major Internet search engines by bidding more aggressively on keywords related to our business. As a result, new tenants sourced through our website increased substantially. Although yellow page advertising continues to become less effective at sourcing new tenants due to the use of the Internet, we still source a significant percentage of new tenants via this channel. During 2010, we revised ou r compensation fee arrangements with yellow page providers to better reflect the reduced effectiveness of this media, resulting in reduced fees as compared to 2009. 

Our future spending on yellow page, media, and Internet advertising expenditures will be driven in part by demand for our self-storage spaces, our current occupancy levels, and the relative efficacy of each type of advertising. Media advertising in particular can be volatile and increase or decrease significantly in the short-term. 

Utility expenses decreased 0.7% in 2010 as compared to 2009, and 5.0% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decreases are due primarily to reduced year-over-year energy prices. It is difficult to estimate future utility cost levels because utility costs are primarily dependent upon changes in demand driven by weather and temperature, as well as fuel prices, each of which are volatile and not predictable. 

Repairs and maintenance expenditures increased 16.5% in 2010 as compared to 2009, and decreased 10.2% in 2009 as compared to 2008 Repairs and maintenance expenditures are dependent upon several factors, such as weather, the timing of periodic needs throughout our portfolio, inflation, and random events and accordingly are difficult to project from year to year. Due to severe weather, snow removal expenses were $2.0 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. We expect overall repairs and maintenance expenditures to grow moderately in 2011. 

Telephone reservation center costs decreased 0.7% in 2010 as compared to 2009, and decreased 12.3% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The reductions were primarily due to lower call volumes, resulting in less staffing hours, as well as a shift from our California to our Arizona call center, resulting in lower average compensation rates. We expect telephone reservation center cost to grow moderately in 2011. 

Insurance expense decreased 3.3% in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 14.3% in 2009 as compared to 2008. These declines reflect softer insurance markets as lack of hurricane activity and additional competition from insurance providers has benefited us. We expect insurance expense in 2011 to be slightly down compared to 2010.

Analysis of Regional Trends 

The following table sets forth regional trends in our Same Store Facilities: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

39 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows. It is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results. We believe that each market has been negatively impacted to some degree by general economic trends over the past two years. Since mid-2009, however, many markets began to experience positive operating trends. There is no assurance that these trends will continue. Over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics. 

Other Facilities 

The Other Facilities include 105 facilities that were either recently acquired, recently developed, or were recently expanded by adding additional storage units. In general, these facilities are not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates. As a result of the fill-up process and timing of when the facilities were put into place, year-over-year changes can be significant. 

The following table summarizes operating data with respect to these facilities: 

40 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    The properties denoted under “Facilities put in place in 2010” were acquired at various dates in 2010. Accordingly, rental income, cost of operations, depreciation and net operating income, represent the operating results for the partial period that we owned the facilities.    

  (b)    See “Net Operating Income” above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our net income in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.    

In 2010, we acquired 42 facilities for an aggregate acquisition cost of $239,643,000. Thirty-two of the facilities are located in California (primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco), three facilities are located in Chicago, IL., two facilities are located in West Palm Beach, FL., and one facility each is located in Atlanta, GA., Honolulu, HI., New Orleans, LA., Newark, NJ., and Columbus, OH. We expect increases in revenues and expenses in 2011 for these 42 acquired facilities as their operations will reflect a full operating period. 

41 

We believe that our management, promotion, and operating infrastructure will result in these 42 facilities stabilizing at a higher level of net operating income than was achieved by the previous owners. However, it can take 24 or more months for these newly acquired facilities to reach stabilization, particularly during the challenging operating conditions we currently are experiencing, particularly in California. Upon acquisition of a facility, we generally reduce rates to new incoming tenants to stimulate move-ins; once a targeted physical occupancy is approached, we raise the rates to new and, more gradually, to existing tenants in order to reach stabilized rents per foot. There can be no assurance that our expectations with respect to these facilities will be achieved. 

The Other Facilities are subject to the same occupancy and rate pressures that our Same Store Facilities are facing, and accordingly the pace at which these facilities reach stabilization, and the ultimate level of cash flows to be reached upon stabilization, may be negatively impacted by the current economic trends. Nonetheless, we expect that the Other Facilities will continue to provide earnings growth during 2011. 

Equity in earnings of real estate entities 

At December 31, 2010, we have equity investments in PSB, Shurgard Europe and five affiliated limited partnerships. Due to our limited ownership interest and lack control of these entities, we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes, and account for such investments using the equity method. 

Equity in earnings of real estate entities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, consists of our pro-rata share of the net income of these Unconsolidated Entities based upon our ownership interest for the period. The following table sets forth the significant components of equity in earnings of real estate entities. Amounts with respect to PSB, Shurgard Europe, and Other Investments are included in our Commercial segment, Europe Self-Storage segment, and other items not allocated to segments, respectively, as described in Note 11 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)    These amounts represent our pro-rata share of the net operating income of the Unconsolidated Entities. See also “net operating income” above for a discussion of this non-GAAP measure.    

42 

  (2)    “Other” reflects our share of general and administrative expense, interest expense, interest income, gains on sale of real estate assets, and other non-property; non-depreciation related operating results of these entities.    

  (3)    Includes our pro rata share of benefit totaling $16.3 million and $1.9 million from PSB’s preferred stock and preferred unit repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.    

Investment in PSB: At December 31 2010 and 2009, we have a 41% common equity interest in PSB, comprised of our ownership of 5,801,606 shares of PSB’s common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in PSB’s underlying operating partnership. The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into PSB common stock. Our ownership interest was reduced during 2009 as PSB sold 3,833,333 shares of its common stock, of which we purchased 383,333 shares or 10% of the shares issued. 

At December 31 2010, PSB owned and operated 21.8 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in eight states. PSB also manages commercial space owned by the Company and affiliated entities pursuant to property management agreements. 

Equity in earnings from PSB decreased to $20,719,000 in 2010 as compared to $35,108,000 in 2009. This decrease was primarily the result of recognizing our pro rata share, $16.3 million, of the benefit that PSB recognized during 2009 as a result of PSB’s preferred stock and preferred partnership unit repurchases. This decrease was partially offset by our pro rata share, $2.1 million, of PSB’s gain on disposition of a property. Equity in earnings was also negatively impacted during 2010 compared to 2009 by our pro-rata share, $4.5 million, of reduced property net operating income due primarily to a 4.1% decline in the annualized realized rent per square foot for PSB’s “Same Park” facilities for 2010, as compared to 2009. 

We expect that our future equity income from PSB will be dependent entirely upon PSB’s operating results. Our investment in PSB provides us with some diversification into another asset type. We have no plans of disposing of our investment in PSB. PSB’s filings and selected financial information can be accessed through the Securities and Exchange Commission, and on PSB’s website, www.psbusinessparks.com. See Note 5 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information on PSB. 

Investment in Shurgard Europe: We originally acquired our 100% interest in Shurgard Europe during our merger with Shurgard, which occurred in August 2006. Our primary objective for merging with Shurgard was to acquire Shurgard’s U.S. domestic assets which accounted for approximately 487 facilities in the U.S. as compared to 160 facilities in Europe at the time of the Shurgard Merger. Subsequent to the Shurgard Merger, management of Public Storage determined that it was in our best interests to reduce our investment in Shurgard Europe. There were many reasons for that determination, most relating to the fact that co ntinued growth of Shurgard Europe would require a significant capital commitment. Movement of capital from Public Storage (in the U.S.) to various European countries would have exposed Public Storage to currency fluctuation risks and to potential tax burdens when Public Storage wished to repatriate its capital investment. Accordingly, in March 2008, we sold 51% of our ownership interest in Shurgard Europe, which helped to limit our capital requirements to continue to grow Shurgard Europe and to limit our exposure to other risks of owning operations in foreign countries. We do not intend to sell any of our remaining interest in Shurgard Europe. In the future, we expect Shurgard Europe to function as a stand-alone entity and to fund its capital requirements primarily with its retained operating cash flow, bank borrowings and, to the extent available, public or private equity. 

As described in Note 3 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements, due to our March 31, 2008 disposition of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe, beginning for periods after March 31, 2008 we no longer consolidate the revenues and expenses of Shurgard Europe on our consolidated statements of income, and our pro-rata share of the operating results of Shurgard Europe is included in “equity in earnings of real estate entities.” Selected financial data for Shurgard Europe for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is included in Note 5 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements. 

This transaction has resulted in the operations of Shurgard Europe having a less significant impact on our operating results, as we have a 49% interest and a loan receivable from Shurgard Europe upon which we receive interest income, rather than the 100% equity interest in Shurgard Europe we held prior to the transaction. Our future operating results will also be impacted by the ultimate returns realized on the reinvestment of the cash proceeds received in connection with this transaction, including the proceeds from the collection of the loan receivable and the timing thereof. 

43 

At December 31, 2010, Shurgard Europe’s operations comprise 188 facilities with an aggregate of approximately 10 million net rentable square feet. The portfolio consists of 116 wholly-owned facilities and 72 facilities owned by two joint venture partnerships, in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% equity interest. 

Our equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe is comprised of our 49% equity share in the net income of Shurgard Europe, as well as 49% of the interest earned with respect to the loan receivable from Shurgard Europe and 49% of trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe, which are reclassified in consolidation from interest and other income to equity in earnings of Shurgard Europe. The amount of interest reclassified was approximately $24.1 million in 2010, $23.9 million in 2009 and $17.8 million in 2007. 

Equity in earnings from our investment in Shurgard Europe for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $15,872,000 as compared to $16,269,000 for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $397,000. This decrease is due primarily to i) the effect of a change in the average exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar to 1.326 for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 1.393 for the same period in 2009, (ii) an increase in general and administrative expense, and (iii) additional depreciation expense, offset partially by iv) our pro-rata share of Shurgard Europe’s same-store properties’ increase in net operating income, on a constant exchange rate basis (see table below) and (v) improvements in operating income from recently developed facilities. 

Equity in earnings from our investment in Shurgard Europe for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $16,269,000 compared to $4,134,000 for the same period in 2008, representing an increase of $12,135,000. This increase includes i) a reduction in our pro-rata share of Shurgard Europe’s depreciation expense, primarily due to declines in tenant intangible amortization, ii) our pro-rata share of a reduction in Shurgard Europe’s third party interest expense (joint ventures in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest refinanced their outstanding debt, effective November 1, 2009, at substantially lower interest rates), (iii) the timing of our disposition of the 51% interest in Shurgard Europe as equity in earnings for 2008 only includes amounts for the period of April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 wh ile the 2009 includes amounts for the entire year, offset by iv) our pro-rata share of Shurgard Europe’s same-store properties’ decline in net operating income, on a constant exchange rate basis, and (v) the effect of a change in the average exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar to 1.393 for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 1.470 for the same period in 2008. 

We evaluate the performance metrics of Shurgard Europe’s Same Store Facilities in order to evaluate the performance of our investment in Shurgard Europe, because the Shurgard Europe Same Store Facilities represent the primary driver of our pro-rata share of earnings of Shurgard Europe. 

The Shurgard Europe Same Store Facilities represent those 91 facilities that have been wholly-owned by Shurgard Europe and stabilized since January 1, 2008 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2008, 2009, and 2010. The following table reflects the operating results of these 91 facilities. 

44 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    In order to isolate changes in the underlying operations from the impact of exchange rates, the amounts in this table are presented on a constant exchange rate basis. The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 have been restated using the actual exchange rate for 2010.    

  (b)    Only the amounts for periods before March 31, 2008 are included in our consolidated financial statements. We include our pro-rata share of these operating results for periods after March 31, 2008 in Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Entities. The amounts incorporated in our financial statements, either consolidated or equity method amounts, are based upon the actual weighted average exchange rates for each period.    

  (c)    We present net operating income “NOI” of the Shurgard Europe Same-Store Facilities, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Although depreciation and amortization is a component of GAAP net income, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, the investment community utilizes NOI in determining real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense as it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization in evaluating our operating results.    

  (d)    Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.    

  (e)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income before late charges and administrative fees by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other items that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due.    

45 

  (f)    Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF. Exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period.    

  (g)    Realized annual rent per available foot or “REVPAF” is computed by dividing rental income before late charges and administrative fees by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.    

  (h)    In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees.    

Shurgard Europe’s operations have been impacted by the same trends in self-storage demand that our domestic facilities faced. Year-over-year revenue growth improved from a 3.5% reduction in 2009, to a 1.7% increase in 2010. At December 31, 2010, in place rental rates were 3.9% higher and average square foot occupancy was down 0.9%, as compared to December 31, 2009. The operating results of the Europe Same Store Facilities are more volatile than the operating results of the Same Store Facilities, because of the relatively smaller size of the Europe Same Store Facilities. 

Net operating income increased 2.7% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 is due to a 1.7% increase in revenues, partially offset by a 0.3% increase in cost of operations. The revenue increase in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 was primarily caused by higher rental income as a result of an increase in average realized annual rental rates per occupied square foot partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy levels. 

Shurgard Europe, similar to our Domestic Self-Storage segment, has a nominal development pipeline. Accordingly, at least in the short-term, we do not expect any significant impact to our earnings from Shurgard Europe’s development activities, other than the continued fill-up of Shurgard Europe’s existing unstabilized facilities. 

In Note 5 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements, we disclose Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results include additional facilities that are not Europe Same Store Facilities, and are based upon historical exchange rates rather than constant exchange rates for each of the respective periods. 

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – European Activities” for additional information on Shurgard Europe’s liquidity. 

Other Investments: The “Other Investments” at December 31, 2010 are comprised primarily of our equity in earnings from various limited partnerships that collectively own 19 self-storage facilities. The reduction for 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to our commencing consolidation of three facilities that we acquired, which were previously owned by entities that we accounted for on the equity method of accounting. Our future earnings with respect to the Other Investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the facilities that these entities own. See Note 5 to our December 31, 2010 consolidate d financial statements for the operating results of these 19 facilities under the “Other Investments.” 

Ancillary Operations 

Ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with (i) the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities in the U.S., (ii) merchandise sales in the U.S., (iii) commercial property operations, (iv) merchandise sales and tenant reinsurance operations conducted by Shurgard Europe to the extent consolidated in our financial statements, and (v) management of facilities for third parties and facilities owned by the Unconsolidated Entities. Revenues and expenses of discontinued ancillary operations, including our truck rental and containerized businesses, are included in discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of income. 

46 

Commercial property operations are included in our Commercial segment, and the merchandise and tenant reinsurance operations conducted by Shurgard Europe are included in our Europe Self-Storage segment to the extent consolidated in our financial statements. All other ancillary revenues and costs of operations are not allocated to any segment. See Note 11 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our segments and for a reconciliation of these ancillary revenues and cost of operations to our net income. 

The following table sets forth our ancillary operations as presented on our consolidated statements of income. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Tenant reinsurance operations: We reinsure policies offered through a non-affiliated insurance company against losses to goods stored by tenants, primarily in our domestic self-storage facilities. The revenues that we record are based upon premiums that we reinsure. Cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses. Included in cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were (increases) reductions of ($250,000), $2,771,000 and $5,800,000, respectively, related to changes in accounting estimates. 

The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues over the past year was primarily attributable to an increase in the percentage of our existing tenants retaining such policies, as well as an increase in the number of facilities due to the acquisition of 42 facilities in the year ended December 31, 2010. On average, approximately 58.2%, 56.8%, and 52.3% of our tenants had such policies during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We believe that the growth in tenant reinsurance revenues in 2011 may not be as high as experienced in 2010 because we expect less growth in the percentage of tenants retaining insurance policies. 

The future level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon the number of new tenants electing to purchase policies, the level of premiums charged for such insurance, and the number of tenants that continue participating in the insurance program. Future cost of operations will be dependent primarily upon the level of losses incurred, including the level of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, that occur and affect our properties thereby increasing tenant insurance claims. 

47 

Commercial operations: We also operate commercial facilities, primarily small storefronts and office space located on or near our existing self-storage facilities that are rented to third parties. We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our commercial operations. 

Merchandise sales and other: We sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at the self-storage facilities that we operate. The primary factor impacting the level of merchandise sales is the level of customer traffic at our self-storage facilities, including the level of move-ins. Merchandise revenues have been negatively impacted in 2010 as compared to 2009 by reduced volume, driven primarily by a shift in the mix of locks sold to a more upscale but lower-margin product. In addition, to a much lesser extent, we also manage self-storage facilities within our existing management infrastructure, for third party owners as well as for the Unconsolidated Entities. 

Other Income and Expense Items 

Interest and other income: Interest and other income was $29,017,000 in 2010, $29,813,000 in 2009, and $36,155,000 in 2008 and is comprised primarily of interest and other income from Shurgard Europe and, to a lesser extent, interest earned on cash balances. 

The interest and other income from Shurgard Europe is comprised of interest income on the loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, as well as trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe for the use of the “Shurgard” trade name. We record 51% of the aggregate interest income and trademark license fees as interest and other income, while 49% is presented as additional equity in earnings on our consolidated statements of income. Interest and other income from Shurgard Europe increased from $24,832,000 in 2009 to $25,121,000 in 2010, due primarily to an increase in the interest rate on the loan receivable from Shurgard Europe from 7.5% to 9.0%, effective November 1, 2009, in connection with an extension of the loan, partially offset by a decrease in the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar to 1.326 for 2010 as compared to 1.393 for 2009. Interest and other income from Shurgard Europe increased from $18,496,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $24,832,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, as no interest or other income in connection with the loan or trademark license fees was recorded prior to March 31, 2008, as any such income received was fully eliminated in consolidation until March 31, 2008. 

The loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, denominated in Euros, totaling €373.7 million ($495.2 million) as of December 31, 2010, matures in March 31, 2013. During, 2010, Shurgard Europe repaid €18.2 million ($24.5 million) on the note. Future interest income recorded in connection with this loan will be dependent upon the average outstanding balance as well as the exchange rate of the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar. All such interest has been paid currently when due and we expect the interest to continue to be paid when due with Shurgard Europe’s operating cash flow. 

Interest earned on our cash balances was $3,896,000, $4,981,000, and $17,659,000 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The reductions in interest earned have been primarily due to reduced interest rates, which decreased in 2008, 2009, and 2010 and are now at historically low rates. 

Future interest income will depend upon the level of interest rates and the timing of when the cash on hand is ultimately invested; however, based upon current interest rates on our outstanding money-market fund investments and short-term investments in high-grade corporate securities of approximately 0.1%, earned interest is expected to be minimal. 

Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense was $354,006,000, $339,766,000 and $408,983,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2010, as compared to 2009 is primarily due to amortization of the tenant intangible assets we acquired in connection with the acquisition of 42 self-storage facilities during 2010. Amortization expense with respect to tenant intangible assets was $13,261,000 for 2010, as compared to $5,530,000 for 2009. We expect approximately $7.0 million in intangible amortization during the year ending December 31, 2011, with respect to our intangible assets at December 31, 2010, primarily attributable to the 42 self-storage facilities we acquired in 2010. Future intangible amortization will also depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities that have tenants in place. 

48 

The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 is due principally to a decline in amortization of tenant intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the 2006 Shurgard Merger. Amortization expense with respect to tenant intangible assets was $5,530,000 in 2009 and $51,158,000 in 2008. 

Effective March 31, 2008, depreciation and amortization ceased on the facilities owned by Shurgard Europe, which was deconsolidated effective March 31, 2008. Included in our depreciation and amortization related to Shurgard Europe’s facilities was $21,871,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2008. 

General and administrative expense: General and administrative expense was $38,487,000, $35,735,000, and $62,809,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. General and administrative expense principally consists of state income taxes, investor relations expenses, and corporate and executive salaries. In addition, general and administrative expenses includes expenses that vary depending on our activity levels in certain areas, such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities, certain expenses related to capital raising and acquisition activities, litigation expenditures, employee severance, share-based compensation, and incentive compensation for corporate and executive personnel. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $2.6 million of expenses related to the acquisition of self-storage facilities. 

General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes $2,144,000 in ongoing general and administrative expense for Shurgard Europe incurred prior to March 31, 2008 and $27,900,000 in additional incentive compensation incurred related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe. Following March 31, 2008, we record no further general and administrative expense incurred by Shurgard Europe’s ongoing operations. 

We expect ongoing general and administrative expense to approximate $35 million to $40 million in 2011, excluding expenses related to property acquisitions. Costs related to property acquisitions are included in general and administrative expense; however, such expenses for 2011 are dependent on the level of acquisitions, which is not determinable at this time. 

Interest expense: Interest expense was $30,225,000, $29,916,000 and $43,944,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

The increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 is due to $1,399,000 in interest expense on debt assumed in connection with property acquisitions during the quarter ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe effective March 31, 2008, which incurred $6,892,000 in interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2008, as well as a reduction of $5,859,000 in interest expense due to the aforementioned early retirement in February 2009 of $110.2 million face amount of senior unsecured debt. 

See Note 6 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements for a schedule of our notes payable balances, principal repayment requirements, and average interest rates. 

Capitalized interest expense totaled $385,000, $718,000 and $1,998,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our development activities. 

Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss): Our loan receivable from Shurgard Europe is denominated in Euros and we have not entered into any agreements to mitigate the impact of currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. As a result, the amount of U.S. Dollars we will receive on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at that time. In each period where we expect repatriation of these funds within two years from period end, we record the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the loan balance from the beginning to the end of the period as a foreign currency gain or loss. We recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $42,264,000, a gain of $9,662,000, and a loss of $25,362,000 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, representing the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the loan due to changes in exchange rates from the beginning to the end of each respective period. The U.S. Dollar exchange rate relative to the Euro was approximately 1.325, 1.433, and 1.409 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

49 

Future foreign exchange gains or losses will be dependent primarily upon the movement of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, the amount owed from Shurgard Europe and our continued expectation with respect to repaying the loan. 

Discontinued Operations: Discontinued operations includes the historical operations of our containerized storage and truck operations that were discontinued in 2009 and the operations of certain self-storage facilities that were discontinued. In addition to the pre-disposal ongoing revenues and expenses of these operations, discontinued operations includes the following items: (i) gains on disposition of discontinued self-storage facilities totaling approximately $7,794,000 for 2010, compared to gains of $6,018,000 for 2009, (ii) $3,500,000 in costs associated with the disposal of trucks recorded in 2009, and (iii) impairment charges associated with terminated ground leases totaling $595,000 for 2010, compared to charges of $8,205,000 recorded for 2 009. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have $456.2 million of cash and $102.3 million in short-term investments in high-grade corporate securities at December 31, 2010. We believe that our cash, the cash that we expect to receive upon maturity of the marketable securities, and the internally generated net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses, debt service requirements, capital improvements and distribution requirements to our shareholders for the foreseeable future. 

Operating as a REIT, our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted. In order for us to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be distributed to our shareholders (see “Requirement to Pay Distributions” below). However, despite the significant distribution requirements, we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow. The following table summarizes our ability to fund capital improvements to maintain our facilities, distributions to the noncontrolling interests, capital improvements to maintain our facilities, and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities. The remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    Represents net cash provided by operating activities for each respective year as presented in our December 31, 2010 consolidated statements of cash flows.    

  (b)    We present cash from operations for principal payments on debt and reinvestment because we believe it is an important measure to evaluate our ongoing liquidity. This measure is not a substitute for cash flows from operations or net cash flows in evaluating our liquidity, ability to repay our debt, or to meet our distribution requirements.    

50 

Our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt-to-total-capitalization. We expect to fund our long-term growth strategies and debt obligations with (i) cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2010, (ii) internally generated retained cash flows, (iii) depending upon current market conditions, proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, and (iv) in the case of acquisitions of facilities, the assumption of existing debt. In general, our strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital, either retained operating cash flow or capital raised through the issuance of common or preferred equity to the extent that market conditions are favorable. 

We have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt. We have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons: (i) under the REIT structure, a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders, making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone, (ii) our perpetual preferred shares have no sinking fund requirement or maturity date and do not require redemption, all of which eliminate future refinancing risks, (iii) after the end of a non-call period, we have the option to redeem the preferred shares at any time, which enables us to refinance higher coupon preferred shares with new preferred shares at lower rates if approp riate, (iv) preferred shares do not contain covenants, thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility, and (v) dividends on the preferred shares can be applied to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements. 

Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “Baa1” by Moody’s, “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A-” by Fitch Ratings. 

Summary of Current Cash Balances and Short-term Capital Commitments: At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $456.2 million of cash and $102.3 million of short-term investments in high-grade corporate securities. We also have access to our $300 million line of credit which does not expire until March 27, 2012. Our capital commitments for 2011 are approximately $153.3 million and include (i) $133.8 million in principal payments on debt and (ii) $19.5 million for the acquisition of five self-storage facilities described below. 

Loan to PSB: On February 9, 2011, we loaned PSB $121.0 million which PSB used to re-pay borrowings against their credit facility and repurchase preferred stock. The loan has a six-month term, no prepayment penalties, and bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.85%. 

Access to Additional Capital: We have a revolving line of credit for borrowings up to $300 million which expires in March 2012. There were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit at February 28, 2011. We seldom borrow on the line of credit and generally view borrowings on the line as a means to bridge capital needs until we are able to refinance them with permanent capital. 

Our ability to raise additional capital by issuing our common or preferred securities is dependent upon capital market conditions. Capital markets have improved from the severe stress experienced in late 2008 and early 2009, and we have recently issued preferred shares at favorable rates (in April and May, 2010, we issued cumulative preferred shares at a rate of 6.875% for gross proceeds of $145 million, and in October 2010 we issued cumulative preferred shares at a rate of 6.500% for gross proceeds of $125 million). Despite our recent issuances of preferred equity, there can be no assurance that market conditions will continue to permit preferred security issuances at amounts and at rates that we will find reasonable. We are not dependent, however, on raising capital to fund our operations or meet our obligations. 

Debt Service Requirements: At December 31, 2010, outstanding debt totaled approximately $568.4 million. Approximate principal maturities are as follows (amounts in thousands):

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Our current intention is to repay the debt at maturity and not seek to refinance debt maturities with additional debt. Alternatively, we may prepay debt and finance such prepayments with cash on-hand or proceeds from the issuance of preferred or common securities. 

Our portfolio of real estate facilities is substantially unencumbered. At December 31, 2010, we have 1,932 self-storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of approximately $6.9 billion that are unencumbered. 

Capital Improvement Requirements: Capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to our facilities, which keep the facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal to the customer. Capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development or expansion of facilities that add additional net rentable square footage to our portfolio. We incurred capital improvements totaling $77.5 million during 2010. During 2011, we expect to incur approximately $81 million for capital improvements and expect to fund such improvements with operating cash flow. 

Requirement to Pay Distributions: We have operated, and intend to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the REIT taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders, provided that at least 90% of our taxable income is so distributed. We believe we have satisfied the REIT distribution requirement since 1981. 

Aggregate distributions paid during 2010 totaled $754.8 million, consisting of the following (amounts in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We estimate the distribution requirements with respect to our cumulative preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2010 to be approximately $230 million per year, assuming no additional preferred share issuances or redemptions during 2011. We redeemed the Equity Shares, Series A on April 15, 2010 and no further distributions will be paid after March 31, 2010. 

On February 25, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.80 per common share. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Future distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with operating cash flow. 

We are also obligated to pay distributions to non-controlling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries. During 2010, we paid distributions totaling $5.9 million with respect to preferred partnership units. During October 2010, we repurchased all of our remaining preferred partnership units which had an annual distribution requirement of $7.3 million, and no further distributions will be paid past the repurchase date. In addition, we are required to pay distributions to other noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries based upon the operating cash flows of the respective subsidiary less any required reserves for capital expenditures or debt repayment. Such non-controlling interests received a total of $18,612,000 in 2010, $18,812,000 in 2009 and $17,716,000 in 2008, which rep resents our expectations with respect to future distribution levels.

Obligations with Respect to Acquisition and Development Activities: At December 31, 2010, we were under contract to acquire five self-storage facilities for an aggregate of $19.5 million, which we closed in January 2011. In February 2011, we acquired the leasehold interest in one of our existing self-storage properties for approximately $6.6 million. During 2011, we will continue to seek to acquire self-storage facilities from third parties; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake. 

We have a minimal development pipeline at December 31, 2010 and have no current plan to expand our development activities. We plan on financing these activities in one or more of the following ways: with available cash on-hand, the assumption of existing debt, borrowings on our line of credit, or the net proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred securities. 

European Activities: We have a 49% interest in Shurgard Europe and our institutional partner owns the remaining 51% interest. As of December 31, 2010, Shurgard Europe owed us €373.7 million ($495.2 million) pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan matures on March 31, 2013, and bears interest at 9.0% per annum. The loan is unsecured and can be prepaid in part or in full at anytime without penalty. During the year ended December 31, 2010, Shurgard Europe repaid €18.2 million ($24.5 million) of the loan. Future payments will be dependent upon Shurgard Europe’s management’s evaluation of uses for its available capital. 

Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in two joint ventures (First Shurgard and Second Shurgard). The two joint ventures collectively had approximately €205.8 million ($272.7 million) of outstanding debt payable to third parties at December 31, 2010, which is non-recourse to Shurgard Europe. One of the joint venture loans, totaling €94.5 million ($125.2 million), is due May 2011, with a right to extend one year. The other joint venture loan, totaling €111.3 million ($147.5 million), was recently refinanced and is now due in July 2013. Both joint venture loans are secured by the joint ventures’ respective facilities, and are not guaranteed by Public Storage, Shurgard Europe or any third party. 

Shurgard Europe and its joint venture partner each have the option to initiate a liquidation of First Shurgard or Second Shurgard. Under the terms of the governing agreements, initiating a liquidation would result, if the process is not otherwise halted by the initiating party, in either a sale of interests between the two partners or, in certain circumstances, the sale of assets to a third party. It is Shurgard Europe’s desire to acquire its joint venture partner’s interests in First Shurgard and Second Shurgard at some point in the future. There is no assurance that such an acquisition would occur (or the timing thereof), and would depend upon Shurgard Europe’s available capital, comparison to other investment alternatives, the potential value of the properties to a third party, and the joint venture partner’s desire to sell at a price that would be attractive to Shurgard Europe. 

Redemption of Preferred Securities: As of December 31, 2010, several series of our preferred securities were redeemable at our option upon at least 30 days notice with dividend rates ranging from 6.125% to 7.000% and have an aggregate redemption value of approximately $1.2 billion. During 2011, we have an additional $1.3 billion liquidation value of our preferred securities that become redeemable, most notably $518 million of our 7.25% Series I Cumulative Preferred Shares and $425 million of our 7.25% Series K Cumulative Preferred Shares, which are available for redemption on May 3, 2011 and August 8, 2011, respectively. Generally our strategy is to redeem a preferred security with the proceeds from the issuance of a new prefer red series having a lower dividend rate, thus reducing our cost of capital, but not necessarily reducing our overall leverage. Accordingly, the redemption of any of the series of preferred securities that are callable will depend upon many factors including current dividend rates that we might pay on newly issued preferred securities. None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders. 

Repurchases of Company’s Common Shares: Our Board of Trustees has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2010, we did not repurchase any of our common shares. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 28, 2011, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. Future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives, and the trading price of our common shares.
