Textron Aviation Segment 

Textron Aviation is a leader in general aviation. Textron Aviation manufactures, sells and services Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, and services the Hawker brand of business jets. The segment has two principal product lines: aircraft and aftermarket. Aircraft includes sales of business jets, turboprop aircraft, piston engine aircraft, and military trainer and defense aircraft. Aftermarket includes commercial parts sales, and maintenance, inspection and repair services. Revenues in the Textron Aviation segment accounted for 33%, 36% and 36% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues for Textron Aviations principal lines of business were as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The family of jets currently produced by Textron Aviation includes the Citation M2, Citation CJ3+, Citation CJ4, Citation XLS+, Citation Latitude, Citation Sovereign+, and the Citation X+, the fastest civilian jet in the world. In addition, the new Citation Longitude, a super-midsize jet which achieved first flight in October 2016, is expected to enter into service in early 2018. Textron Aviation is also continuing the development of the Citation Hemisphere, a large-cabin jet. 

Textron Aviations turboprop aircraft include the Beechcraft King Air C90GTx, King Air 250, King Air 350ER and King Air 350i, and the Cessna Caravan and Grand Caravan EX. The Cessna Denali, a high-performance single engine turboprop aircraft, is expected to achieve its first flight in 2018. In addition, Textron Aviation recently announced the Cessna Skycourier, a twin-engine, high-wing, large-utility turboprop aircraft, which is targeted for first flight in 2019. Textron Aviations piston engine aircraft include the Beechcraft Baron and Bonanza, and the Cessna Skyhawk, Skylane, and the Turbo Stationair. 

Textron Aviation also offers the T-6 trainer, which is used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, the AT-6 light attack military aircraft, and the Scorpion. The Scorpion is a highly affordable, multi-mission aircraft designed primarily for the tactical military jet aviation market. This aircraft is not yet in production, pending customer orders. 

In support of its family of aircraft, Textron Aviation operates a global network of 18 service centers, two of which are co-located with Bell Helicopter, along with more than 350 authorized independent service centers located throughout the world. Textron Aviation-owned service centers provide customers with 24-hour service and maintenance. Textron Aviation also provides its customers with around-the-clock parts support and offers a mobile support program with over 60 mobile service units and several dedicated support aircraft. In addition, Able Aerospace Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Textron Aviation, also provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft.

Textron Aviation markets its products worldwide through its own sales force, as well as through a network of authorized independent sales representatives. Textron Aviation has several competitors domestically and internationally in various market segments. Textron Aviations aircraft compete with other aircraft that vary in size, speed, range, capacity and handling characteristics on the basis of price, product quality and reliability, direct operating costs, product support and reputation. 

Bell Segment 

Bell Helicopter is one of the leading suppliers of military and commercial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and services in the world. Revenues for Bell accounted for 23%, 23% and 26% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues by Bells principal lines of business were as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bell supplies advanced military helicopters and support to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the United States. Bells primary U.S. Government programs are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters. Bell is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company (Boeing), the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Through its strategic alliance with Boeing, Bell produces and supports the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and also for Japan under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. The H-1 helicopter program includes a utility model, the UH-1Y, and an advanced attack model, the AH-1Z, which have 84% parts commonality between them. While the U.S. Marine Corps is the primary customer for H-1 helicopters, we also sell H-1 helicopters under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. 

Bell is developing the V-280 Valor, a next generation vertical lift aircraft as part of the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) initiative. The JMR-TD program is the science and technology precursor to the Department of Defenses Future Vertical Lift program. Aircraft designed through this initiative will compete to replace thousands of aging utility and attack helicopters for the U.S. Armed Forces over the next decade. The V-280 achieved its first flight in December 2017. 

Through its commercial business, Bell is a leading supplier of commercially certified helicopters and support to corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue and emergency medical helicopter operators, and foreign governments. Bell produces a variety of commercial aircraft types, including light single- and twin-engine helicopters and medium twin-engine helicopters, along with other related products. The helicopters currently offered by Bell for commercial applications include the 407GXP, 412EP, 412EPI, 429, 429WLG, 505 Jet Ranger X and Huey II. In addition, the 525 Relentless, Bells first super medium commercial helicopter, is expected to achieve certification in 2019. 

For both its military programs and its commercial products, Bell provides post-sale support and service for an installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters through a network of five Bell-operated service centers, four global parts distribution centers and over 100 independent service centers located in 35 countries. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support, including parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service and product support engineering. 

Bell competes against a number of competitors throughout the world for its helicopter business and its parts and support business. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and reliability, product support, performance and reputation.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fuel Systems and Functional Components 

Our Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line is produced by our Kautex business unit which is headquartered in Bonn, Germany and operates over 30 plants in 14 countries. Kautex is a leading developer and manufacturer of blow-molded plastic fuel systems for cars, light trucks and all-terrain vehicles. Kautex also develops and manufactures clear-vision systems for automobiles and selective catalytic reduction systems used to reduce emissions from diesel engines, as well as plastic bottles and containers for medical, household, agricultural, laboratory and industrial uses. Additionally, Kautex operates a business that produces cast iron engine camshafts, crankshafts and other engine components. Kautex serves the global automobile market, with operating facilities near its major customers around the world. 

Our automotive products have several major competitors worldwide, some of which are affiliated with the OEMs that comprise our targeted customer base. Competition typically is based on a number of factors including price, technology, environmental performance, product quality and reliability, prior experience and available manufacturing capacity. 

Specialized Vehicles 

Our Specialized Vehicles product line includes products sold by the Textron Specialized Vehicles businesses under the E-Z-GO, Textron Off Road, Arctic Cat, TUG Technologies, Douglas Equipment, Premier, Safeaero, Ransomes, Jacobsen, Cushman and Dixie Chopper brands. These businesses design, manufacture and sell golf cars, off-road utility vehicles, recreational side-by-side and all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, light transportation vehicles, aviation ground support equipment and professional turf-maintenance equipment, as well as specialized turf-care vehicles. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of Arctic Cat that we completed on March 6, 2017. 

These businesses have a diversified customer base that includes golf courses and resorts, government agencies and municipalities, consumers, outdoor enthusiasts, and commercial and industrial users such as factories, warehouses, airports, planned communities, hunting preserves, educational and corporate campuses, sporting venues, municipalities and landscaping professionals. Sales are made through a combination of factory direct resources and a network of independent distributors and dealers worldwide. We have two major competitors for both golf cars and professional turf-maintenance equipment, and several competitors for off-road utility vehicles, recreational all-terrain and light transportation vehicles, side-by-sides and snowmobiles, aviation ground support equipment, and specialized turf-care products. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and reliability, product features, product support and reputation. 

Tools and Test Equipment 

The Tools and Test Equipment product line includes products sold by businesses that design and manufacture powered equipment, electrical test and measurement instruments, mechanical and hydraulic tools, cable connectors, fiber optic assemblies, underground and aerial transmission and distribution products and power utility products. This product line encompasses the Greenlee, Greenlee Communications, Greenlee Utility, HD Electric, Klauke, Sherman+Reilly and Endura businesses and brands. Their products are used principally in the construction, maintenance, telecommunications, data communications, electrical, utility and plumbing industries, and are distributed through a global network of sales representatives and distributors, as well as through direct sales to home improvement retailers and OEMs. The businesses have plant operations in five countries with almost half of their combined revenues coming from outside the United States. These businesses face competition from numerous manufacturers based primarily on price, delivery lead time, product quality and reliability. 

Finance Segment 

Our Finance segment, or the Finance group, is a commercial finance business that consists of Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Finance segment provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters. A substantial number of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the U.S. Finance receivables originated in the U.S. are primarily for purchasers who had difficulty in accessing other sources of financing for the purchase of Textron-manufactured products. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our Finance group paid our Manufacturing group $174 million, $173 million and $194 million, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products to third parties that were financed by the Finance group.

Table of Contents 

The commercial finance business traditionally is extremely competitive. Our Finance segment is subject to competition from various types of financing institutions, including banks, leasing companies, commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment vendors. Competition within the commercial finance industry primarily is focused on price, term, structure and service. 

Our Finance segments largest business risk is the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio. See Finance Portfolio Quality in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 28 for information about the Finance segments credit performance. 

Backlog 

Our backlog at the end of 2017 and 2016 is summarized below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Approximately 38% of our total backlog at December 30, 2017 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2018. 

Backlog with the U.S. Government represented 58% of our total backlog at December 30, 2017 and excluded amounts where funding has not been formally appropriated. At December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Bells backlog included $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to a multi-year contract with the U.S. Government for the purchase of V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. 

For information regarding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard on backlog, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 48 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

U.S. Government Contracts 

In 2017, approximately 22% of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the U.S. Government, excluding those contracts under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. This business is subject to competition, changes in procurement policies and regulations, the continuing availability of funding, which is dependent upon congressional appropriations, national and international priorities for defense spending, world events, and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate. 

Our contracts with the U.S. Government generally may be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination, including, if applicable, reasonable profit on such work, as well as reasonable termination costs. If, however, the U.S. Government terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted and services rendered, an agreed-upon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property, and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government may not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and may be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract; (c) the U.S. Government may not be liable for assets we own and utilize to provide services under the fee-for-service contracts; and (d) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. 

Research and Development 

Information regarding our research and development expenditures is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 47 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We own, or are licensed under, numerous patents throughout the world relating to products, services and methods of manufacturing. Patents developed while under contract with the U.S. Government may be subject to use by the U.S. Government. We also own or license active trademark registrations and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in various foreign countries or regions, as well as trade names and service marks. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole. Some of these trademarks, trade names and service marks are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports, including: A-2PATS; Able Aerospace Services; Able Preferred; Aeronautical Accessories; AAI; acAlert; Aerosonde; AirScout; Alterra; AH-1Z; Ambush; Arctic Cat; Ascent;

These marks and their related trademark designs and logotypes (and variations of the foregoing) are trademarks, trade names or service marks of Textron Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures. 

Environmental Considerations 

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and expenditures for environmental control facilities has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional information regarding environmental matters is contained in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 66 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. 

Employees 

At December 30, 2017, we had approximately 37,000 employees.
