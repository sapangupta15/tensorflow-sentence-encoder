PART I  

ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

GENERAL  

Founded in 1935, Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Company, we, us or our) are one of the worlds largest meat protein companies and the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.  

We operate a fully vertically integrated poultry production process. Our integrated operations consist of breeding stock, contract growers, feed production, processing, further-processing, marketing and transportation of chicken and related allied products, including animal and pet food ingredients. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cobb-Vantress, Inc. (Cobb), we are one of the leading poultry breeding stock suppliers in the world. Investing in breeding stock research and development allows us to breed into our flocks the characteristics found to be most desirable.  

We also process live fed cattle and hogs and fabricate dressed beef and pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts, case ready beef and pork and fully-cooked meats. In addition, we derive value from allied products such as hides and variety meats sold to further processors and others.  

We produce a wide range of fresh, value-added, frozen and refrigerated food products. Our products are marketed and sold primarily by our sales staff to grocery retailers, grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, warehouse club stores, military commissaries, industrial food processing companies, chain restaurants or their distributors, international export companies and domestic distributors who serve restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors. Additionally, sales to the military and a portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers and trading companies.  

We have been exploring ways to commercialize our supply of poultry litter and animal fats. In June 2007, we announced a 50/50 joint venture with Syntroleum Corporation, called Dynamic Fuels LLC. Dynamic Fuels LLC produces renewable synthetic fuels targeting the renewable diesel and jet fuel markets. Construction of production facilities was completed in late fiscal 2010, and initial production began in October 2010.  

FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SEGMENTS

RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY  

Chicken: The primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers. Our vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing. Breeder flocks (i.e., grandparents) are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced. Fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets (i.e., parents). Pullets are sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries. Once chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms. There, contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards, with advice from our technical service personnel, until the broilers reach the desired processing weight. Adult chickens are transported to processing plants, which are slaughtered and converted into finished products, then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers.  

We operate our own feed mills to produce scientifically-formulated feeds. In fiscal 2010, corn and soybean meal were major production costs, representing roughly 42% of our cost of growing a live chicken. In addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens, we use cooking ingredients, packaging materials and cryogenic agents. We believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs, and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future. While we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers, from time-to-time we purchase live, ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production requirements.  

Beef: The primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle. We do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. We also enter into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities. We believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs.  

Pork: The primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs. The majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers. We employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are processed. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. We believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs. Additionally, we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs.   

Prepared Foods: The primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials, including chicken, beef, pork, corn, flour and vegetables. Some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments, while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers. We believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs.  

SEASONAL DEMAND  

Demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months. Pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months, primarily due to the holiday season, while demand decreases during the spring and summer months.  

CUSTOMERS  

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for 13.4% of our fiscal 2010 consolidated sales. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a material impact on our operations. No other single customer or customer group represents more than 10% of fiscal 2010 consolidated sales.

COMPETITION  

Our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers. Additionally, our food products compete in markets around the world.  

We seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy, which includes:  

    identifying target markets for value-added products;  

    concentrating production, sales and marketing efforts to appeal to and enhance demand from those markets; and  

    utilizing our national distribution systems and customer support services.  

Past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy, as supported by our distribution systems. The principal competitive elements are price, product safety and quality, brand identification, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of products, customer service and credit terms.  

INTERNATIONAL  

We exported to more than 100 countries in fiscal 2010. Major export markets include Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.  

We have the following international operations:  

    Tyson de Mexico, a Mexican subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated poultry production company;  

    Cobb-Vantress, a chicken breeding stock subsidiary, has business interests in Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, India, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom and Venezuela;  

    Tyson do Brazil, a Brazilian subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated poultry production company;  

    Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods, joint ventures in China in which we have a majority interest, is a vertically-integrated poultry production company;  

    Tyson Dalong, a joint venture in China in which we have a majority interest, is a chicken further processing facility;  

    Jiangsu-Tyson, a Chinese poultry breeding company, is building a vertically-integrated poultry operation with production expected to begin in fiscal 2011;  

    Godrej Tyson Foods, a joint venture in India in which we have a majority interest, is a poultry processing business; and  

    Cactus Argentina, a majority interest in a vertically-integrated beef operation joint venture in Argentina; however, we do not consolidate the entity due to the lack of controlling interest.  

We continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries. Additional information regarding export sales, long-lived assets located in foreign countries and income (loss) from foreign operations is set forth in Note 20: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  

We conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development, to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations, and to improve chicken breeding stock. In 2007, we opened the Discovery Center, which includes 19 research kitchens and a USDA-inspected pilot plant. The Discovery Center brings new market-leading retail and foodservice products to the customer faster and more effectively. Research and development costs totaled $38 million, $33 million and $30 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND FOOD SAFETY  

Our facilities for processing chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods, milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and except as described below, is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future.  

Congress and the United States Environmental Protection Agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions. It is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized, or what the final form may be. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue, it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us, and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect.

Table of Contents 

We work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality. In addition to our own internal Food Safety and Quality Assurance oversight and review, our chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution, primarily by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We are also participants in the United States Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program and are subject to the Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.  

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS  

As of October 2, 2010, we employed approximately 115,000 employees. Approximately 97,000 employees were employed in the United States and 18,000 employees were in foreign countries, primarily China, Mexico and Brazil. Approximately 29,000 employees in the United States were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, with approximately 19% of those employees included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2011. These agreements expire over periods throughout the next several years. Approximately 7,000 employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are good.  

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  

Our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers. As such, we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products. On an ongoing basis, we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research. In addition to supporting strong regional brands across multiple protein lines, we build the Tyson brand primarily through well-defined product-specific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs. These efforts are designed to present key Tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines. We utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve a leading market position for our products.  

We have the ability to produce and ship fresh, frozen and refrigerated products worldwide. Domestically, our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses, public cold storage facilities and our transportation system. Our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate less-than-truckload orders into full truckloads, thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service. In addition, we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders. Our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United States. Internationally, we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports, where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations.  

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS  

We have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application. Because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products, we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts. We also have developed non-public proprietary information regarding our production processes and other product-related matters. We utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and, where appropriate, seek patent and/or trademark protection for the technology we utilize.  

INDUSTRY PRACTICES  

Our agreements with customers are generally short-term, primarily due to the nature of our products, industry practices and fluctuations in supply, demand and price for such products. In certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers, we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer, with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable. Due to volatility of the cost of raw materials, fixed price contracts are generally limited to three months in duration.
