 Company typically acts as general partner of, and investment adviser to, its alternative investment, real estate and merchant banking funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds with subscribing investors contributing the majority.  

Institutional Investors.  

The Company provides investment management strategies and products to institutional investors worldwide, including corporations, pension plans, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and banks through a broad range of pooled vehicles and separate accounts. Additionally, the Company provides sub-advisory services to various unaffiliated financial institutions and intermediaries.

Competition.  

All aspects of the Companys businesses are highly competitive, and the Company expects them to remain so. The Company competes in the U.S. and globally for clients, market share and human talent in all aspects of its business segments. The Companys competitive position depends on its reputation and the quality and consistency of its long-term investment performance. The Companys ability to sustain or improve its competitive position also depends substantially on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs. The Company competes with commercial banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and through the internet. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. Such changes could result in the Companys remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. See also Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors herein.  

Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management Group.  

The Companys competitive position for its Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management Group business segments depends on innovation, execution capability and relative pricing. The Company competes directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers and with others on a regional or product basis.

Table of Contents 

The Companys ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is generally dependent on the Companys credit ratings) and to commit capital efficiently, particularly in its capital-intensive underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects its competitive position. Corporate clients may request that the Company provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities, and such requests are expected to increase in the future.  

It is possible that competition may become even more intense as the Company continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain areas. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure in our businesses. The complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require effective resource allocation in order for the Company to remain competitive.  

The Company has experienced intense price competition in some of its businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute securities trades electronically on exchanges and through other automated trading markets has increased the pressure on trading commissions. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely continue. It is possible that the Company will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of its competitors may seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.  

Asset Management.  

Competition in the asset management industry is affected by several factors, including the Companys reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment strategies or product offerings relative to peers and an appropriate benchmark index, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels and investment pipelines, and the types and quality of products offered. The Companys alternative investment products, such as private equity funds, real estate and hedge funds, compete with similar products offered by both alternative and traditional asset managers.  

Supervision and Regulation  

As a major financial services firm, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where it operates. Moreover, in response to the financial crisis, legislators and regulators, both in the U.S. and around the world, are in the process of adopting and implementing a wide range of reforms that will result in major changes to the way the Company is regulated and conducts its business. It will take time for the comprehensive effects of these reforms to emerge and be understood.  

Regulatory Outlook.  

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. While certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, other portions will be effective only following extended transition periods. Moreover, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will be accomplished through numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies, only a portion of which have been completed. It remains difficult to assess fully the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on the Company and on the financial services industry generally. In addition, various international developments, such as the adoption of risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee), known as Basel III, will impact the Company in the coming years.  

It is likely that 2012 and subsequent years will see further material changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which the Company operates, although it remains difficult to predict which further reform initiatives will become law, how such reforms will be implemented or the exact impact they will have on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period.

Financial Holding Company.  

The Company has operated as a bank holding company and financial holding company under the BHC Act since September 2008.  

Consolidated Supervision.  

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve also gained heightened authority to examine, prescribe regulations and take action with respect to all of the Companys subsidiaries. In particular, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is subject to (among other things) significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision, to more intensive scrutiny of its businesses and plans for expansion of those businesses, to new activities limitations, to the Volcker Rule, to a systemic risk regime which will impose especially high capital and liquidity requirements, and to comprehensive new derivatives regulation. In addition, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has exclusive rulemaking and primary enforcement and examination authority over the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer financial laws, to the extent applicable.  

Scope of Permitted Activities. The BHC Act provides a two-year period from September 21, 2008, the date that the Company became a bank holding company, for the Company to conform or dispose of certain nonconforming activities as defined by the BHC Act. Three one-year extensions may be granted by the Federal Reserve upon approval of the Companys application for each extension. The Company has received the second of these extensions with respect to certain activities relating to its real estate and other funds businesses. It has also disposed of certain nonconforming assets and conformed certain activities to the requirements of the BHC Act. Although conformance activities continue with respect to these businesses, it is possible that the Company will be required, in 2012, to seek Federal Reserve approval for the third additional year permitted by the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve may grant an extension if it finds that the extension will not be detrimental to the public interest. Based on the nonconforming real estate and other investments and businesses which are required to be sold, the Company believes there would be no material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition or operations.  

In addition, the Company is engaged in discussions with the Federal Reserve regarding its commodities activities, as the BHC Act also grandfathers activities related to the trading, sale or investment in commodities and underlying physical properties, provided that the Company was engaged in any of such activities as of September 30, 1997 in the United States and provided that certain other conditions that are within the Companys reasonable control are satisfied. If the Federal Reserve were to determine that any of the Companys commodities activities did not qualify for the BHC Act grandfather exemption, then the Company would likely be required to divest any such activities that did not otherwise conform to the BHC Act by the end of any extensions of the grace period. At this time the Company does not believe, based on its interpretation of applicable law, that any such required divestment would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or operations.  

Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule. A section of the BHC Act added by the Dodd-Frank Act (the Volcker Rule) will, over time, prohibit banking entities, including the Company and its affiliates, from engaging in proprietary trading, as defined by the regulators. The Volcker Rule will also require banking entities to either restructure or unwind certain investments and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds, as such terms are defined in the Volcker Rule and by the regulators. Comments on proposed regulations to implement the substantive Volcker Rule provisions were due by February 13, 2012. It is unclear whether final rules will be in place by July 21, 2012 when the Volcker Rule is scheduled to become effective.  

Banking entities will have a two-year transition period to come into full compliance with the Volcker Rule, subject to the possibility of extensions. While full compliance with the Volcker Rule will likely only be required

Table of Contents 

 by July 2014, subject to extensions, the Companys business and operations are expected to be impacted earlier, as operating models, investments and legal structures must be reviewed and gradually adjusted to the new legal environment. The Company continues to review its private equity fund, hedge fund and proprietary trading operations. With respect to the proprietary trading prohibition of the Volcker Rule, the Company has previously announced plans to dispose of its in-house proprietary quantitative trading unit, Process-Driven Trading (PDT), by the end of 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2011, PDT did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The Company has also previously exited other standalone proprietary trading businesses (defined as those businesses dedicated solely to investing the Companys capital), and the Company is continuing to liquidate legacy positions related to those businesses.  

There remains considerable uncertainty about the interpretation of the proposed rules, and we are unable to predict what the final version of the rules will be or the impact they may have on our businesses. We are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the Volcker Rule, and when the regulations are final, we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities and make plans to implement compliance with the Volcker Rule.  

Capital and Liquidity Standards. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company and evaluates its compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Companys national bank subsidiaries. Under current capital requirements, for the Company to remain a financial holding company, its bank subsidiaries must qualify as well capitalized by maintaining a total capital ratio (total capital to risk-weighted assets) of at least 10% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%. The capital standards applicable to the Companys bank subsidiaries also apply directly to the Company, as a holding company, and require it to remain well capitalized to maintain its status as a financial holding company. The Federal Reserve may require the Company and its peer financial holding companies to maintain risk-based and leverage capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and their particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. In addition, under the Federal Reserves leverage rules, bank holding companies that have implemented the Federal Reserves risk-based capital measure for market risk, such as the Company, are subject to a Tier 1 minimum leverage ratio of 3%.  

The Company calculates its capital ratios and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve. These standards are based upon a framework described in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I. In December 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published final regulations incorporating the Basel II Accord, which requires internationally active banking organizations, as well as certain of their U.S. bank subsidiaries, to implement Basel II standards over the next several years. In July 2010, the Company began reporting its capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to its regulators under Basel I and Basel II as part of a phased implementation of Basel II.  

In June 2011, the U.S. banking regulators published final regulations implementing a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring that certain institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, including the Company, be subject to capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. As a result, the generally applicable capital standards, which are based on Basel I standards, but may themselves change over time, will serve as a permanent floor to minimum capital requirements calculated under the Basel II standard the Company is currently required to implement, as well as future capital standards. 

In addition, when implemented, Basel III will impose a new minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 equity ratio of 6%, and the minimum total capital ratio will remain at 8.0% (plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer consisting of common equity in addition to these ratios). The new capital conservation buffer will impose a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress. Basel III also introduces new liquidity measures designed to monitor banking institutions for their ability to meet short-term

 cash flow needs and to address longer-term structural liquidity mismatches. The Federal Reserve is expected to propose rules implementing Basel III in the U.S. in 2012. However, many provisions, once adopted, will be subject to extended phase-in periods.  

The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to implement a provision under Basel III that would require global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), such as the Company, to hold an additional capital buffer. Although the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement this G-SIB surcharge, in November 2011 the Financial Stability Board endorsed a Basel Committee proposal providing that the capital surcharge would range from 1% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, and that the largest systemically important financial institutions could potentially be subject to a 3.5% capital surcharge.  

See also Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationLiquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory Requirements in Part II, Item 7 herein.  

Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends. U.S. banking regulators have recently imposed new capital planning and stress test requirements on large bank holding companies, including the Company. As of December 2011, bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, such as the Company, must submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the bank holding company and the Federal Reserve. The scenario provided by the Federal Reserve in 2011 includes a sizable shortfall in U.S. economic activity and employment, accompanied by a sizeable decline in global economic activity, sharp market price movements in European sovereign and financial sectors, among other adverse circumstances. The capital plans must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases), and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact the bank holding companys consolidated capital. The capital plans must include a discussion of how the bank holding company will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common ratio of 5%, and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary depository institutions.  

Beginning in 2012, bank holding companies subject to the capital planning requirements, including the Company, must submit their capital plans in January each year, and the Federal Reserve must object to them, in whole or in part, or provide written notice of non-objection by March 31 each year. If the Federal Reserve objects to the capital plan, or if certain material events occur after approval of a plan, the bank holding company must submit a revised capital plan within 30 days. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before taking a capital action if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after taking the proposed capital action. In addition to capital planning requirements, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Company, MSBNA and other depository institution subsidiaries of the Company, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. All of these policies and other requirements could influence the Companys ability to pay dividends, or require it to provide capital assistance to MSBNA or MS Private Bank under circumstances under which the Company would not otherwise decide to do so.

Systemic Risk Regime. The Dodd-Frank Act established a new regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions deemed to pose systemic risks. Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, such as the Company, became automatically subject to the systemic risk regime in July 2010. A new oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council), can recommend prudential standards, reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions, and must approve any finding by the Federal Reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions. The Council is also empowered to designate systemically

 important payment, clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions, subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation, and, assisted by the new Office of Financial Research within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) (established by the Dodd-Frank Act), can gather data and reports from financial institutions, including the Company.  

In December 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement certain requirements of the systemic risk regime. Among other provisions, the proposed rules would require systemically important financial institutions, such as the Company, to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event, to conduct regular liquidity stress tests, and to implement various liquidity risk management requirements. More generally, the proposed rules would require institutions to comply with a range of corporate governance requirements, such as establishment of a risk committee of the board of directors and appointment of a chief risk officer, both of which the Company already has.  

The proposed rules would also limit the aggregate exposure of each of the largest systemically important financial institutions, including the Company, to each other such institution to 10% of the aggregate capital and surplus of each institution, and limit the aggregate exposure of such institutions to any other bank holding company with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets to 25% of each institutions aggregate capital and surplus. In addition, the proposed rules would create a new early remediation regime to address financial distress or material management weaknesses determined with reference to four levels of early remediation, including heightened supervisory review, initial remediation, recovery, and resolution assessment, with specific limitations and requirements tied to each level. The proposed rules would also subject systemically important financial institutions to regular stress tests, including institution-administered tests and separate tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, and require publication of public summaries of institutions self-administered stress tests.  

The systemic risk regime also provides that, for institutions posing a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, the Federal Reserve, upon Council vote, must limit that institutions ability to merge, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate activities, impose conditions on activities or, as a last resort, require it to dispose of assets. Upon a grave threat determination by the Council, the Federal Reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemic risk regime to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15-to-1 if the Council considers it necessary to mitigate the risk. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish further standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures.  

See also Capital and Liquidity Standards above and Orderly Liquidation Authority below.  

Orderly Liquidation Authority. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial companies, including bank holding companies such as Morgan Stanley and certain covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to a new orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations. Absent such U.S. Treasury determinations, the Company as a bank holding company would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  

The orderly liquidation authority went into effect in July 2010, and rulemaking to render it fully operative is proceeding in stages, with some implementing regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed. If the Company were subjected to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable rights and powers that it must exercise with the goal of liquidating and winding up the Company, including (i) the FDICs right to assign assets and liabilities and transfer some to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (ii) the ability of the FDIC to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (iii) the broad powers given the FDIC to administer the claims process to determine which creditor receives what, and in which order, from assets not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution.

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.  

U.S. Banking Institutions. MSBNA, primarily a wholesale commercial bank, offers consumer lending and commercial lending services in addition to deposit products. Certain foreign exchange activities are also conducted in MSBNA. As an FDIC-insured national bank, MSBNA is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC.  

MS Private Bank conducts certain mortgage lending activities primarily for customers of its affiliate retail broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (MSSB LLC). MS Private Bank also offers certain deposit products, as well as personal trust and prime brokerage custody services. MS Private Bank is an FDIC-insured national bank whose activities are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC.  

Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by their federal banking regulators. Among other things, it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Current regulations generally apply only to insured banks and thrifts such as MSBNA or MS Private Bank and not to their parent holding companies, such as Morgan Stanley. The Federal Reserve is, however, subject to limitations, authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level. In addition, as described above, under the systemic risk regime, the Company will become subject to an early remediation protocol in the event of financial distress.  

Transactions with Affiliates. The Companys U.S. subsidiary banks are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on any extensions of credit to, purchase of assets from, and certain other transactions with, any affiliates. These restrictions include limits on the total amount of credit exposure that they may have to any one affiliate and to all affiliates, as well as collateral requirements, and they require all such transactions to be made on market terms. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the affiliate transaction limits will be substantially broadened. Implementing rulemaking is called for by July 2012. At that time, the Companys U.S. banking subsidiaries will also become subject to more onerous lending limits. Both reforms will place limits on the Companys U.S. banking subsidiaries ability to engage in derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions with other affiliates of the Company.  

FDIC Regulation. An FDICinsured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an insured depository institution under common control by the same bank holding company. As FDIC-insured depository institutions, MSBNA and MS Private Bank are exposed to each others losses. In addition, both institutions are exposed to changes in the cost of FDIC insurance. In 2010, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to replenish the reserve fund over a multi-year period. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, some of the restoration must be paid for exclusively by large depository institutions, including MSBNA, and assessments are calculated using a new methodology that generally favors banks that are mostly funded by deposits.  

Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management Group.  

Broker-Dealer Regulation. The Companys primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, MS&Co. and MSSB LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are members of various self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and various securities exchanges and clearing organizations. In addition, MS&Co. and MSSB LLC are registered investment advisers with the SEC. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers, representatives and other associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Violations of the laws and regulations governing a broker-dealers actions could result in censures, fines, the  

12  

Table of Contents 

 issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar consequences by both federal and state securities administrators.  

The Dodd-Frank Act includes various provisions that affect the regulation of broker-dealer sales practices and customer relationships. For example, the SEC is authorized to adopt a fiduciary duty applicable to broker-dealers when providing investment advice to retail customers. The Dodd-Frank Act also creates a new category of regulation for municipal advisors, which are subject to a fiduciary duty with respect to certain activities. The U.S. Department of Labor is considering revisions to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that could subject broker-dealers to a fiduciary duty and prohibit specified transactions for a wider range of customer interactions. These developments may impact the manner in which affected businesses are conducted, decrease profitability and increase potential liabilities. If the SEC exercises authority provided to it under the Dodd-Frank Act to prohibit or limit the use of mandatory arbitration pre-dispute agreements between a broker-dealer and its customers, it may materially increase the Companys litigation costs.  

Margin lending by broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserves restrictions on lending in connection with customer and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities. Broker-dealers are also subject to maintenance and other margin requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory organization rules. In many cases, the Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries margin policies are more stringent than these rules.  

As registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the SECs net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various exchanges, other regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Many non-U.S. regulatory authorities and exchanges also have rules relating to capital and, in some cases, liquidity requirements that apply to the Companys non-U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries. These rules are generally designed to measure general financial integrity and/or liquidity and require that at least a minimum amount of net and/or more liquid assets be maintained by the subsidiary. See also Consolidated Supervision and Capital Standards above. Rules of FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations also impose limitations and requirements on the transfer of member organizations assets.  

Compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit the Companys operations requiring the intensive use of capital. Such requirements restrict the Companys ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer subsidiaries, which in turn may limit its ability to pay dividends, repay debt, or redeem or purchase shares of its own outstanding stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely affect the Companys ability to pay dividends or to expand or maintain present business levels. In addition, such rules may require the Company to make substantial capital infusions into one or more of its broker-dealer subsidiaries in order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules.  

MS&Co. and MSSB LLC are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for customers of broker-dealers against losses in the event of the insolvency of a broker-dealer. SIPC protects customers eligible securities held by a member broker-dealer up to $500,000 per customer for all accounts in the same capacity subject to a limitation of $250,000 for claims for uninvested cash balances. To supplement this SIPC coverage, each of MS&Co. and MSSB LLC have purchased additional protection for the benefit of their customers in the form of an annual policy issued by certain underwriters and various insurance companies that provides protection for each eligible customer above SIPC limits subject to an aggregate firmwide cap of $1 billion with no per client sublimit for securities and a $1.9 million per client limit for the cash portion of any remaining shortfall. As noted under Systemic Risk Regime, the Dodd-Frank Act contains special provisions for the orderly liquidation of covered financial institutions (which could potentially include MS&Co. and/or MSSB LLC). While these provisions are generally intended to provide customers of covered broker-dealers with protections at least as beneficial as they would enjoy in a broker-dealer liquidation proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act, the details and implementation of such protections are subject to further rulemaking.

Over the past few years, the SEC has undertaken a review of a wide range of equity market structure issues. As a part of this review, the SEC has adopted new regulations and proposed various rules regarding market transparency. A new short sale uptick rule that limits the ability to sell short securities that have experienced specified price declines is now in effect. The SEC also adopted rules requiring broker-dealers to maintain risk management controls and supervisory procedures with respect to providing access to securities markets, which will become fully effective in 2012. In addition, in an effort to prevent volatile trading, self-regulatory organizations have adopted trading pauses, more commonly referred to as circuit breakers, with respect to certain securities. It is possible that the SEC or self-regulatory organizations could propose or adopt additional market structure rules in the future.  

The provisions, new rules and proposals discussed above could result in increased costs and could otherwise adversely affect trading volumes and other conditions in the markets in which we operate.  

Regulation of Registered Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities. As registered futures commission merchants, MS&Co. and MSSB LLC are subject to net capital requirements of, and their activities are regulated by, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and various commodity futures exchanges. The Companys futures and options-on-futures businesses also are regulated by the National Futures Association (NFA), a registered futures association, of which MS&Co. and MSSB LLC and certain of their affiliates are members. These regulatory requirements differ for clearing and non-clearing firms, and they address obligations related to, among other things, the registration of the futures commission merchant and certain of its associated persons, membership with the NFA, the segregation of customer funds and the holding apart of a secured amount, the use of customer funds, the receipt of an acknowledgment of certain written risk disclosure statements, the receipt of trading authorizations, the furnishing of daily confirmations and monthly statements, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, the supervision of accounts and antifraud prohibitions. Among other things, the NFA has rules covering a wide variety of areas such as advertising, telephone solicitations, risk disclosure, discretionary trading, disclosure of fees, minimum capital requirements, reporting and proficiency testing. MS&Co. and MSSB LLC have affiliates that are registered as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under certain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance. Under CFTC and NFA rules, commodity trading advisors who manage accounts and are registered with the NFA must distribute disclosure documents and maintain specified records relating to their activities, and clients and commodity pool operators have certain responsibilities with respect to each pool they operate. For each pool, a registered commodity pool operator must prepare and distribute a disclosure document; distribute periodic account statements; prepare and distribute audited annual financial reports; and keep specified records concerning the participants, transactions and operations of each pool, as well as records regarding transactions of the commodity pool operator and its principals. Violations of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity exchanges could result in remedial actions, including fines, registration restrictions or terminations, trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships.  

The Companys commodities activities are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety and other governmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. Intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by U.S. federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and by the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement and remedial proceedings involving energy companies, including those engaged in power generation and liquid hydrocarbons trading. Terminal facilities and other assets relating to the Companys commodities activities also are subject to environmental laws both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, pipeline, transport and terminal operations are subject to state laws in connection with the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal. See also Scope of Permitted Activities above.  

On October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted a position limits rule that, when effective, would impose position limits on a traders positions in futures, options, and swaps on 28 energy, metals, and agricultural commodities. In  

14  

Table of Contents 

 December 2011, industry organizations filed a lawsuit against the CFTC challenging the validity of the rule. This rule, if it withstands legal challenge and becomes effective, may affect trading strategies and affect the profitability of various businesses and transactions.  

Derivatives Regulation. Through the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company will face a comprehensive U.S. regulatory regime for its activities in certain OTC derivatives. The regulation of swaps and security-based swaps (collectively, Swaps) in the U.S. will be effected and implemented through CFTC, SEC and other agency regulations, which are currently being adopted.  

The Dodd-Frank Act requires central clearing of certain types of Swaps, public and regulatory reporting, and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or execution facilities. These requirements are subject to some exceptions and will be phased in over time. However, market participants, including the Companys entities engaging in Swaps, will have to centrally clear, report and trade on an exchange or execution facility certain Swap transactions that are currently uncleared, not reported publicly and executed bilaterally.  

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC (collectively, Swaps Entities). Certain subsidiaries of the Company will be required to register as a swap dealer and security-based swap dealer and it is possible some subsidiaries may register as a major swap participant and major security-based swap participant. Swaps Entities will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime with new obligations for the Swaps activities for which they are registered, including new capital requirements, a new margin regime for uncleared Swaps and a new segregation regime for collateral of counterparties to uncleared Swaps. Swaps Entities also will be subject to additional duties, including internal and external business conduct and documentation standards with respect to their Swaps counterparties.  

The specific parameters of these Swaps Entities requirements are being developed through CFTC, SEC and bank regulator rulemakings. The impact of the regulation on Morgan Stanley entities required to register remains unclear. It is likely, however, that the Company will face increased costs due to the registration and regulatory requirements listed above. Complying with the proposed regulation of Swaps Entities could require the Company to restructure its Swaps businesses, require extensive systems changes, require personnel changes, and raise additional potential liabilities and regulatory oversight. Compliance with Swap-related regulatory capital requirements may require the Company to devote more capital to its Swaps business. The extraterritorial impact of the rules also remains unclear.  

Morgan Stanley Swap Entities will also be subject to new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act regarding segregation of customer collateral for cleared transactions, position limits, large trader reporting regimes, compensation requirements and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements related to activities in Swaps.  

The European Union (E.U.) is in the process of amending its OTC derivatives regulations. In October 2011, the E.U. published a proposal to amend the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and recently reached an accord to require central clearing of certain OTC derivatives. The Company currently expects that, when the E.U. OTC derivatives regime is fully implemented, it will be similar to derivatives regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act, including with respect to the scope of derivatives covered, and mandatory clearing, reporting, and trading requirements. It is unclear at present how the E.U. and U.S. derivatives regulation will interact.  

Non-U.S. Regulation. The Companys institutional securities businesses also are regulated extensively by non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which the Company maintains an office. Certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries are regulated as broker-dealers under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries engaged in banking and trust activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) and several  

15  

Table of Contents 

 U.K. securities and futures exchanges, including the London Stock Exchange and Euronext.liffe, regulate the Companys activities in the U.K.; the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) and the Deutsche Bôrse AG regulate its activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; Eidgenôssische Finanzmarktaufsicht (the Financial Market Supervisory Authority) regulates its activities in Switzerland; the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of Japan, the Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese securities and futures exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange, regulate its activities in Japan; the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited regulate its operations in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Limited regulate its business in Singapore.  

Asset Management.  

Many of the subsidiaries engaged in the Companys asset management activities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Many aspects of the Companys asset management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the Company from carrying on its asset management activities in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for such failure include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on the Company engaging in various asset management activities for specified periods of time or specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines. In order to facilitate its asset management business, the Company owns a registered U.S. broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc., which acts as distributor to the Morgan Stanley mutual funds and as placement agent to certain private investment funds managed by the Companys asset management business segment. See also Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management GroupBroker-Dealer Regulation above.  

As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Companys asset management activities will be subject to certain additional laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements (including with respect to clients that are private funds), restrictions on sponsoring or investing in, or maintaining certain other relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds under the Volcker Rule (subject to certain limited exceptions) and certain rules and regulations regarding trading activities, including trading in derivatives markets. Many of these new requirements may increase the expenses associated with the Companys asset management activities and/or reduce the investment returns the Company is able to generate for its asset management clients. Many important elements of the Dodd-Frank Act will not be known until rulemaking is finalized and certain final regulations are adopted. See also Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule and Derivatives Regulation above.  

The Companys Asset Management business is also regulated outside the U.S. For example, the FSA regulates the Companys business in the U.K.; the Financial Services Agency regulates the Companys business in Japan; the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulates the Companys business in India; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates the Companys business in Singapore.  

Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions.  

The Companys Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program is coordinated on an enterprise-wide basis. In the U.S., for example, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, bank holding company subsidiaries, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, and mutual funds to implement AML programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Outside the U.S., applicable laws, rules and regulations similarly require designated types of financial institutions to implement AML programs. The Company has implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to  

16  

Table of Contents 

 comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. The Company has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to the U.S. foreign policy, national security, or economy; by other governments; or by global or regional multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Security Council.  

Anti-Corruption.  

The Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Company is also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which became effective on July 1, 2011. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules, and regulations.  

Protection of Client Information.  

Many aspects of the Companys business are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer information, including those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the E.U. Data Protection Directive and various laws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal Information (Protection) Law, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act. The Company has adopted measures designed to comply with these and related applicable requirements in all relevant jurisdictions.  

Research.  

Both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators continue to focus on research conflicts of interest. Research-related regulations have been implemented in many jurisdictions. New and revised requirements resulting from these regulations and the global research settlement with U.S. federal and state regulators (to which the Company is a party) have necessitated the development or enhancement of corresponding policies and procedures.  

Compensation Practices and Other Regulation.  

The Companys compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators issued final guidance applicable to all banking organizations, including those supervised by the Federal Reserve. This guidance was promulgated in accordance with compensation principles and standards for banks and other financial companies, which were designed to encourage the sound compensation practices established by the Financial Stability Board at the direction of the leaders of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. The guidance was designed to help ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. The scope and content of the Federal Reserves policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and may change based on findings from its horizontal review process, and the Company expects that these policies will evolve over a number of years. In this regard, in October 2011, the Federal Reserve published its first report detailing findings from its horizontal review process. In the report, the Federal Reserve announced its intention to implement the compensation disclosure requirements adopted in July 2011 by the Basel Committee.  

The Company is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which may impact its compensation practices. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must prescribe regulations to require covered financial institutions, including the Company, to report the structures of all of their incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based  

17  

Table of Contents 

 payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing employees, directors or principal shareholders with compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the covered financial institution. In April 2011, seven federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, jointly proposed an interagency rule implementing this requirement. The proposed rule is expected to be finalized in 2012. Further, pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the SEC must direct listing exchanges to require companies to implement policies relating to disclosure of incentive-based compensation that is based on publicly reported financial information and the clawback of such compensation from current or former executive officers following certain accounting restatements.  

In addition to the guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and referenced above, the Companys compensation practices may also be impacted by other regulations promulgated in accordance with the Financial Stability Board compensation principles and standards. These standards are to be implemented by local regulators. For instance, in December 2010, the FSA published a policy statement outlining amendments to the Remuneration Code, which governs remuneration of employees at certain banks, to address compensation-related rules under the E.U. Capital Requirements Directive. In October 2011, the FSA finalized and published additional guidance with respect to the Remuneration Code.  

For a discussion of certain risks relating to the Companys regulatory environment, see Risk Factors herein.
