Accounting Period

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2013, December 30, 2012 and January 1, 2012 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ending December 28, 2014 will also include 52 weeks.

Overview of Fiscal Year 2013 

We realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2013, to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our Informatics business, as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, were moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments. The principal products and services of our two operating segments are:

•Human Health. Develops diagnostics, tools and applications to help detect diseases earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. The Human Health segment serves both the diagnostics and research markets.

•Environmental Health. Provides products, services and solutions to facilitate the creation of safer food and consumer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment serves the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets.

As a result of the realignment, we reallocated goodwill from the Environmental Health segment to the Human Health segment based on the relative fair value, determined using the income approach, of the businesses within the historical Environmental Health segment. The change resulted in $215.7 million of goodwill being allocated from the Environmental Health segment to the Human Health segment.

During fiscal year 2013, we continued to see good performance from acquisitions, investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives. Our overall revenue in fiscal year 2013 increased $51.0 million, or 2%, as compared to fiscal year 2012, reflecting an increase of $35.1 million, or 3%, in our Human Health segment revenue and an increase of $15.9 million, or 2%, in our Environmental Health segment revenue. The increase in our Human Health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013 was due to growth in our diagnostics business from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions, as well as increased demand for our informatics offerings and in-vivo imaging systems in the research market. The increase in our Environmental Health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013 was due to growth in our laboratory services business, partially offset by decreased demand for some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets.

In our Human Health segment during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, we experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the United States increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East and Africa and Korea, as well as increased demand for our informatics offerings and in-vivo imaging systems in the research market. This growth was partially offset by slight declines in our medical imaging business despite continued growth in our complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor imaging technology, as well as declines in our radiometric detection businesses within the research market, as a result of sequestration concerns in the United States, European austerity and weakening research markets in Asia, particularly in Japan. As the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers, we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease, which can result in savings of long-term health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients, are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets.

30
In our Environmental Health segment, our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time, while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for our customers. During fiscal year 2013, we continued to experience growth in our laboratory services business by the addition of new customers to our OneSource multivendor service offering, partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets. We anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient, analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions.

Our consolidated gross margins decreased 44 basis points in fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012, due to pricing pressure and unfavorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, partially offset by the fiscal year 2013 mark-to-market income for our postretirement benefit plans, as compared to the mark-to-market loss in fiscal year 2012, and productivity improvements. Our consolidated operating margin increased 538 basis points in fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily due to lower pre-tax impairment charges of $6.7 million in fiscal year 2013 as compared to $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012, a pre-tax gain of $17.6 million in fiscal year 2013 as compared to a pre-tax loss of $31.8 million in fiscal year 2012 for the mark-to-market adjustments for our postretirement plans and cost containment and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by higher restructuring costs and lower gross margins.

We believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. Overall, we believe that our strategic focus on Human Health and Environmental Health coupled with our breadth of end markets, deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Revenue

2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $2,166.2 million, as compared to $2,115.2 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, which includes an approximate 1% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 0.4% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in revenue reflects a $35.1 million, or 3%, increase in our Human Health segment revenue, due to an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $22.0 million and an increase in research market revenue of $13.1 million. Our Environmental Health segment revenue increased $15.9 million, or 2%, due to an increase in laboratory services market revenue of $23.2 million, partially offset by decreases in environmental and industrial markets revenue of $7.3 million. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $7.3 million of revenue primarily related to our informatics business in our Human Health segment for fiscal year 2013 and $26.2 million for fiscal year 2012 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue for fiscal year 2012 was $2,115.2 million, as compared to $1,918.5 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of $196.7 million, or 10%, which includes an approximate 7% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 2% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in revenue reflects a $196.8 million, or 20%, increase in our Human Health segment revenue, due to an increase in research market revenue of $148.1 million and an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $48.7 million. Our Environmental Health segment revenue for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 included an increase in revenue of $10.3 million from the laboratory services market, which was almost completely offset by decreases in revenue of $10.3 million from the environmental and industrial markets. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $26.2 million of revenue primarily related to our informatics business in our Human Health segment for fiscal year 2012 and $30.8 million for fiscal year 2011 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

Cost of Revenue

2013 Compared to 2012. Cost of revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $1,189.3 million, as compared to $1,152.0 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of approximately $37.3 million, or 3%. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 54.9% in fiscal year 2013 from 54.5% in fiscal year 2012, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of approximately 44 basis points to 45.1% in fiscal year 2013 from 45.5% in fiscal year 2012. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $53.1 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $51.8 million for fiscal year 2012. The mark-to-market adjustment for 

31
postretirement benefit plans was a loss of $0.8 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to a loss of $3.7 million for fiscal year 2012. Stock-based compensation expense was $1.3 million for both fiscal years 2013 and 2012. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an expense of approximately $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $5.2 million for fiscal year 2012. Acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs added an expense of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013. In addition to the factors noted above, the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of pricing pressure and unfavorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, partially offset by productivity improvements.

2012 Compared to 2011. Cost of revenue for fiscal year 2012 was $1,152.0 million, as compared to $1,070.7 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of approximately $81.3 million, or 8%. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased to 54.5% in fiscal year 2012 from 55.8% in fiscal year 2011, resulting in an increase in gross margin of approximately 135 basis points to 45.5% in fiscal year 2012 from 44.2% in fiscal year 2011. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $51.8 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to $53.4 million for fiscal year 2011. The mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss of $3.7 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to a loss of $4.2 million for fiscal year 2011. Stock-based compensation expense increased and was $1.3 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to $1.1 million for fiscal year 2011. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an expense of approximately $5.2 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to $4.1 million for fiscal year 2011. In addition to the factors noted above, the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of increased sales volume, changes in product mix with growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and productivity improvements, partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

2013 Compared to 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2013 were $585.9 million, as compared to $632.7 million for fiscal year 2012, a decrease of approximately $46.9 million, or 7%. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased and were 27.0% in fiscal year 2013, compared to 29.9% in fiscal year 2012. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $36.9 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $38.9 million for fiscal year 2012. The mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was income of $18.1 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to a loss of $27.9 million for fiscal year 2012. Stock-based compensation expense decreased and was $11.9 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $19.0 million for fiscal year 2012. Environmental charges related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities were $4.6 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs added an expense of $1.1 million for fiscal year 2013 and $0.3 million for fiscal year 2012. In addition to the factors noted above, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of cost containment and productivity initiatives.

2012 Compared to 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2012 were $632.7 million, as compared to $624.4 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of approximately $8.3 million, or 1%. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased and were 29.9% in fiscal year 2012, compared to 32.5% in fiscal year 2011. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $38.9 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to $25.9 million for fiscal year 2011. The mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss of $27.9 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to a loss of $62.9 million for fiscal year 2011. Stock-based compensation expense increased and was $19.0 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to $13.8 million for fiscal year 2011. Acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs added an expense of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2012 and $11.2 million for fiscal year 2011. In addition to the factors noted above, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to acquisitions and growth and productivity investments, particularly in emerging territories, offset by cost containment initiatives.

Research and Development Expenses

2013 Compared to 2012. Research and development expenses for fiscal year 2013 were $133.0 million, as compared to $132.6 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.3%. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 6.1% in fiscal year 2013, as compared to 6.3% in fiscal year 2012. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $0.3 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $0.5 million for fiscal year 2012. The mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was income of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to a loss of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2012. Stock-based compensation expense increased and was $0.9 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $0.8 million for fiscal year 2012. Acquisition related costs added an expense of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013. We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. We directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

32
2012 Compared to 2011. Research and development expenses for fiscal year 2012 were $132.6 million, as compared to $115.8 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of $16.8 million, or 15%.

Stock-based compensation expense increased and was $0.8 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to $0.6 million for fiscal year 2011. We directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2012 and 2011, primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

Restructuring and Contract Termination Charges, Net

We have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, alignment with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units. Restructuring and contract termination charges for fiscal year 2013 were a $33.9 million charge, as compared to a $25.1 million charge for fiscal year 2012 and an $13.5 million charge for fiscal year 2011.

The following table summarizes our restructuring and contract termination accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan, as well as contract termination, during fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The restructuring plans for the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2013 were principally intended to shift certain of our research and development resources into a newly opened Center for Innovation. The restructuring plan for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 was principally intended to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center as well as realign operations, research and development resources and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions. The restructuring plan for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets. The restructuring plan for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 was principally intended to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets. The restructuring plan for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 was principally intended to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center. The restructuring plans for the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2012 were principally intended to realign operations, research and development resources and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions. We expect the impact of future cost savings on operating results and cash flows from restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2013 will exceed $9.0 million annually beginning in fiscal year 2015. We expect the impact of future cost savings on operating results and cash flows from restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2012 will exceed $11.0 million annually beginning in fiscal year 2014. These future cost savings will be primarily a decrease to cost of revenue and a decrease to selling, general and administrative expenses.

Q4 2013 Restructuring Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, our management approved a plan principally intended to shift certain of our research and development resources into a newly opened Center for Innovation (the “Q4 2013 Plan”). As a result of the Q4 

33
2013 Plan, we recognized a $8.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space and recognized a $3.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. 

As part of the Q4 2013 Plan, we reduced headcount by 74 employees. All employees were notified of termination under the Q4 2013 Plan by December 29, 2013, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $2.0 million for workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. We also anticipate that the remaining payments of $6.9 million, net of estimated sublease income, for the closure of the excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year 2019, in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases.

The following table summarizes the components of our Q4 2013 Plan activity recognized by segment:

Q2 2013 Restructuring Plan

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, our management approved a plan principally intended to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center as well as realign operations, research and development resources, and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions (the “Q2 2013 Plan”). As a result of the Q2 2013 Plan, we initially recognized a $9.9 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space, and recognized a $8.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. Subsequent to the initial charge, we recorded an additional $0.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment for services that were provided for one-time benefits in which the employee was required to render service beyond the legal notification period. 

As part of the Q2 2013 Plan, we reduced headcount by 265 employees. All employees were notified of termination under the Q2 2013 Plan by June 30, 2013. We anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $12.8 million for workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, as local law requires some severance to be paid in monthly installments through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. The closure of the facility space will not require any additional payments.

As a result of the Q3 2012 Plan, and during fiscal year 2012, we recognized $3.9 million pre-tax restructuring charges in each of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. During fiscal year 2013, we also recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.3 million in each of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments due to lower than expected costs associated with remaining severance payments, as local law requires some severance to be paid in monthly installments through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.

35
As part of the Q3 2012 Plan, we will reduce headcount by 66 employees. All employees were notified of termination by September 30, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $3.8 million for workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.

Q2 2012 Restructuring Plan

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, our management approved a plan to realign operations, research and development resources, and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions (the “Q2 2012 Plan”). As a result of the Q2 2012 Plan, and during fiscal year 2012, we recognized a $7.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and recognized a $0.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. During fiscal year 2013 we recorded an additional $2.1 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment for services that were provided for one-time benefits in which the employee was required to render service beyond the legal notification period. In addition during fiscal year 2013, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.3 million due to lower than expected costs associated with remaining severance payments. We expect to recognize an additional $0.1 million of incremental restructuring expense in future periods as services are provided for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits. This expense will be recognized ratably over the required service period.

As part of the Q2 2012 Plan, we will reduce headcount by 203 employees. All employees were notified of termination by July 1, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $1.3 million for workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.

Q1 2012 Restructuring Plan

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, our management approved a plan to realign operations and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions (the “Q1 2012 Plan”). As a result of the Q1 2012 Plan, and during fiscal year 2012, we recognized a $5.4 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space and recognized a $1.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. During fiscal year 2013, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million in our Human Health segment and a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.1 million in our Environmental Health segment due to lower than expected costs associated with remaining severance payments. 

As part of the Q1 2012 Plan, we reduced headcount by 112 employees. All employees were notified of termination and actions related to the closure of excess facility space were completed by April 1, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $0.1 million for workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. The closure of the excess facility space will not require any additional payments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2011 were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our Human Health and Environmental Health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy. During fiscal year 2013, we paid $2.4 million related to these plans and recorded a reversal of $1.1 million primarily related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions within each of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments. As of December 29, 2013, we had $7.5 million of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans, primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities and remaining severance payments for workforce reductions in both our Human Health and Environmental Health segments. We expect to make payments for these leases, the terms of which vary in length, through fiscal year 2022.

Contract Termination Charges

We have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. We recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2013, a pre-tax charge of $1.5 million in fiscal year 2012 and a pre-tax charge of $2.0 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in our Environmental Health segment. We made payments for these obligations of $1.0 million during fiscal year 2013, $2.9 million during fiscal year 2012, and $0.4 million during fiscal year 2011. The remaining balance of these accruals as of December 29, 2013 was $0.3 million. 

Impairment of Assets

2013 Compared to 2012. Impairment of assets was $6.7 million in fiscal year 2013, as compared to $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012. The fiscal year 2013 pre-tax impairment charge was $6.7 million for the impairment of certain long-lived assets within our Human Health segment as the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value. Additional information regarding these impairments is discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

2012 Compared to 2011. Impairment of assets was $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012, as compared to $3.0 million in fiscal year 2011. As part of integrating our recent acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the PerkinElmer trade name. Accordingly, we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012. We recognized $73.4 million pre-tax impairment charges in our Human Health segment and also recognized $0.7 million pre-tax impairment charges in our Environmental Health segment. The fiscal year 2011 pre-tax impairment charge was $3.0 million for the impairment of intangible assets within our Human Health segment for the full impairment of license agreements that we no longer intend to use.

Interest and Other Expense, Net

Interest and other expense, net, consisted of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 Compared to 2012. Interest and other expense, net, for fiscal year 2013 was an expense of $64.1 million, as compared to an expense of $48.0 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $16.2 million. The increase in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to an increase in other expense, net, resulting from a prepayment premium of $11.1 million for the redemption of our 2015 Notes. Interest expense increased by $4.1 million in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily due to the write-off of $2.8 million for the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and the write-off of $0.2 million for the remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of our 2015 Notes. Interest income decreased by $0.1 million in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily due to lower cash balances throughout fiscal year 2013. Other expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased by $11.9 million as compared to fiscal year 2012, and consisted primarily of a prepayment premium of $11.1 million for the redemption of our 2015 Notes, expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

2012 Compared to 2011. Interest and other expense, net, for fiscal year 2012 was an expense of $48.0 million, as compared to an expense of $26.8 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of $21.2 million. The increase in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to higher debt balances and an increase of fixed rate debt to partially fund our acquisition of Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. ("Caliper") in fiscal year 2011. Interest expense increased by $21.0 million in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011, primarily due to the increased debt and the higher interest rates on those debt balances associated with the issuance of the 2021 Notes. Interest income decreased by $1.1 million in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011, primarily due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates on invested cash. For fiscal year 2011, acquisition related financing costs added expense of $3.1 million, and is included in interest expense. Other expenses for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 decreased by $1.0 million, and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities.

(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes

2013 Compared to 2012. The fiscal year 2013 benefit from income taxes on continuing operations was $14.6 million, as compared to a benefit of $17.9 million for fiscal year 2012. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was a benefit of 9.5% for fiscal year 2013 as compared to a benefit of 35.3% for fiscal year 2012. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $24.0 million related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions. The $24.0 million of discrete items includes $9.4 million for lapses in statutes of limitations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and $9.2 million primarily for lapses in statues of limitations and audit settlements in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, which included the pre-tax impairment charges of $74.2 million, partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

2012 Compared to 2011. The fiscal year 2012 benefit from income taxes on continuing operations was $17.9 million, as compared to a provision of $63.2 million for fiscal year 2011. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was a benefit of 35.3% for fiscal year 2012 as compared to an expense of 98.2% for fiscal year 2011. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, which included the pre-tax impairment charges of $74.2 million, partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions. The fiscal year 2011 provision for incomes taxes includes a provision of $79.7 million related to our planned $350.0 million repatriation of previously unremitted earnings. 

Discontinued Operations

As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and 

38
related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Any remaining liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2013 and December 30, 2012.

We recorded the following pre-tax gains and losses, which have been reported as a gain or loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In June 2010, we sold our Photoflash business, which was included in our Environmental Health segment, for $13.5 million, including an adjustment for net working capital, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million in fiscal year 2013 and a pre-tax gain of $2.5 million in fiscal year 2012 for contingent consideration related to this sale. 

In August 1999, we sold the assets of our Technical Service business for approximately $250.0 million in cash and the assumption by us of certain liabilities of our Technical Services business. During fiscal year 2013, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million for a contingency related to this business.

During fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2011. The fiscal year 2011 pre-tax gain included a $4.0 million gain for contingent consideration related to the sale of our semiconductor business in fiscal year 2006, which was partially offset by a pre-tax loss of $1.8 million related to updating the net working capital adjustment associated with the sale of our Illumination and Detection Solutions ("IDS") business in fiscal year 2010.

We recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2013, a tax provision of $0.9 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2012 and a tax benefit of $4.5 million in fiscal year 2011 on discontinued operations. The recognition of $4.5 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2011 was primarily the result of a change in estimate related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, as further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, partially offset by the tax provision on the contingent consideration received in fiscal year 2011 related to the sale of our semiconductor business in fiscal year 2006. 

Business Combinations

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2013

We completed the acquisition of four businesses for total consideration of $11.4 million, in cash. As of the closing dates, we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration for the four acquired businesses of up to $2.2 million, which at closing had an estimated fair value of $1.1 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our operations from the acquisition dates. As of December 29, 2013, the purchase accounting allocations related to these acquisitions were preliminary.

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2012

Acquisition of Haoyuan Biotech Co., Ltd. In November 2012, we acquired all outstanding stock of Haoyuan. Haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acid-based blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets. We expect this acquisition to extend our capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening, as well as deepen our position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in China. We paid the shareholders of Haoyuan $38.0 million in cash for the stock of Haoyuan. We recorded a receivable of $2.7 million from the shareholders of Haoyuan as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of certain contingencies. As of the closing date, we potentially had to pay the shareholders additional contingent consideration of up to $30.0 million, which at closing had an estimated fair value of $1.9 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is 

39
tax deductible. We reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date. 

We do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 to be material to our consolidated results of operations; therefore, we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to December 29, 2013 and December 30, 2012 were minimal. We have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.

As of December 29, 2013 the purchase price allocation for the Haoyuan acquisition was final. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2013 were based upon an initial valuation. Our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuation are subject to change within the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period. During the measurement period, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. Adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements. The effect of adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The effects of any such adjustments, if material, may cause changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income or expense recognized in prior periods. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement period are included in current period earnings.

Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period. We may have to pay contingent consideration, related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $31.3 million as of December 29, 2013. As of December 29, 2013, we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisitions of Dexela Limited, Haoyuan and Tetra Teknolojik Sistemler Limited Sirketi, with an estimated fair value of $4.9 million. The earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed three years from the acquisition date. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. 

In connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. We do not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. During fiscal year 2013, we accrued an additional $5.7 million related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities, of which $4.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. We have accrued $13.5 million as of December 29, 2013, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. We filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In 2007, after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excluded certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents, summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants. The case was assigned to a new district court judge in January 2009 and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided Enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the “Connecticut Case”), which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo’s case against us. In March 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. The district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants. On September 12, 2012, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. On December 21, 2012, we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion, which the court also granted in part and denied in part. The case is expected to go to trial in March 2014.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above, and we are contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Various tax years after 2006 remain open to examination by certain tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as China, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. We make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 29, 2013 should not have a material adverse effect 

41
on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

We announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2013 to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our Informatics business, as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, were moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments.

Human Health

2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $1,209.8 million, as compared to $1,174.6 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $35.1 million, or 3%, which includes an approximate 2% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 0.3% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The increase in revenue in our Human Health segment was a result of an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $22.0 million and an increase in research market revenue of $13.1 million. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $7.3 million of revenue in our Human Health segment for fiscal year 2013 and $26.2 million of revenue in our Human Health segment for fiscal year 2012 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. This increase in our Human Health segment during fiscal year 2013 was due to growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the United States increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East and Africa, and Korea, as well as increased demand for our informatics offerings and in-vivo imaging systems in the research market. This growth was partially offset by slight declines in our medical imaging business despite continued growth in our complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor imaging technology, as well as declines in our radiometric detection businesses within the research market, as a result of sequestration concerns in the United States, European austerity and weakening research markets in Asia, particularly in Japan.

Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 was $146.1 million, as compared to $59.2 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $86.9 million, or 147%. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $80.2 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $80.8 million for fiscal year 2012. Restructuring and contract termination charges increased and were $22.2 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $17.6 million for fiscal year 2012. Impairment of assets was a charge of $6.7 million for fiscal year 2013 as the carrying amounts of certain long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value, as compared to $73.4 million for fiscal year 2012 as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy. Acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs added an expense of $1.4 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to an expense of $0.1 million for fiscal year 2012. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions was $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $5.2 million for fiscal year 2012. In addition to the factors noted above, increased sales volume in the diagnostics and research markets, favorable changes in product mix, and cost containment initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2013, which were partially offset by higher costs related to growth and productivity investments.

2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue for fiscal year 2012 was $1,174.6 million, as compared to $977.9 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of $196.8 million, or 20%, which includes an approximate 15% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 2% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2012, as compared to fiscal year 2011, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The increase in revenue in our Human Health segment was a result of an increase in research market revenue of $148.1 million and an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $48.7 million. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $26.2 million of revenue in our Human Health segment for fiscal year 2012 and $30.8 million of revenue in our Human Health segment for fiscal year 2011 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. This increase in our Human Health segment revenue during fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to growth in the research market due to growth in our informatics offerings, continued demand for our in-vivo imaging systems with the addition of Caliper imaging systems, as well as increased demand for our automation tools and our Operetta® cellular imaging systems. The growth in the research market was partially offset by a decline in demand for our suite of radioactive reagents, and reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from reduced research and development spending. We also experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the United States began to stabilize and from 

42
continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets such as China. In our medical imaging business, we had growth in our traditional diagnostic imaging offerings and continued growth from our therapeutic and non-medical applications, as well as increased demand for our CMOS imaging technology.

Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 was $59.2 million, as compared to $89.7 million for fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $30.5 million, or 34%. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $80.8 million for fiscal year 2012 and $64.9 million for fiscal year 2011. Restructuring and contract termination charges increased and were $17.6 million for fiscal year 2012 as compared to $6.3 million for fiscal year 2011. Impairment of assets was a charge of $73.4 million for fiscal year 2012 as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, as compared to $3.0 million for fiscal year 2011 for the full impairment of license agreements that we no longer intend to use. Acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs added an expense of $0.1 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to an expense of $10.8 million for fiscal year 2011. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions was $5.2 million for fiscal year 2012 as compared to $4.1 million for fiscal year 2011. In addition to the factors noted above, incremental costs related to acquisitions and growth and productivity investments, particularly in emerging territories, decreased operating income for fiscal year 2012, which was partially offset by increased sales volume, favorable changes in product mix and cost containment initiatives.

Environmental Health

2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $956.5 million, as compared to $940.6 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $15.9 million, or 2%, which includes an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and an approximate 0.4% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The increase in revenue in our Environmental Health segment was a result of an increase in revenue of $23.2 million from the laboratory services market, partially offset by decreases in revenue of $7.3 million from the environmental and industrial markets. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.01 million of revenue for fiscal year 2013 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. This increase in our Environmental Health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to growth in our laboratory services business by the addition of new customers to our OneSource multivendor service offering, partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets.

Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 was $97.1 million, as compared to $111.8 million for fiscal year 2012, a decrease of $14.8 million, or 13%. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $10.1 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $10.4 million for fiscal year 2012. Restructuring and contract termination charges increased and were $11.8 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $7.6 million for fiscal year 2012. Impairment of assets decreased and was a charge of zero for fiscal year 2013 as compared to a charge of $0.7 million for fiscal year 2012 as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy. Acquisition related costs for contingent consideration and other costs was an expense of $0.2 million for both fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2012. In addition to the factors noted above, pricing pressure, unfavorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, and increased costs related to growth investments decreased operating income for fiscal year 2013, which was partially offset by increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives.

2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue for both fiscal years 2012 and 2011 was $940.6 million. Revenue for fiscal year 2012 includes an approximate 2% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and no impact to revenue attributable to acquisitions. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2012, as compared to fiscal year 2011, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Our Environmental Health segment revenue for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 included an increase in revenue of $10.3 million from the laboratory services market, which was almost completely offset by decreases in revenue of $10.3 million from the environmental and industrial markets, due primarily to decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets, partially offset by continued strength in our inorganic analysis solutions.

Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 was $111.8 million, as compared to $108.9 million for fiscal year 2011, an increase of $2.9 million, or 3%. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $10.4 million for fiscal year 2012 as compared to $15.1 million for fiscal year 2011. Restructuring and contract termination charges increased and were $7.6 million for fiscal year 2012 as compared to $7.1 million for fiscal year 2011. Impairment of assets was a charge of $0.7 million for fiscal year 2012 as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy and no impairment occurred in our Environmental Health segment during fiscal year 2011. Acquisition related costs for contingent consideration and other costs was an expense of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2012, 

43
as compared to an expense of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2011. In addition to the factors noted above, increased sales volume, changes in product mix with growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and cost containment initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2012, which was offset by increased costs related to growth and productivity investments, particularly in emerging territories.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:

•changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

•increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,

•a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2013 

Operating Activities. Net cash provided by continuing operations was $158.1 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of $153.6 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $4.5 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $167.9 million, and non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $128.5 million, restructuring and contract termination charges, net, of $33.9 million, stock based compensation expense of $14.1 million and impairment of assets charge of $6.7 million. These amounts were partially offset by a net decrease of $144.8 million in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, a net increase in working capital of $30.1 million and income related to our postretirement benefit plans, including the mark-to-market adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, of $18.2 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital for fiscal year 2013, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $14.4 million, an increase in inventory of $13.9 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.8 million. The increase in accounts receivable was a result of higher sales volume late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. The increase in inventory was primarily a result of realigning operations, research and development resources, and production resources within our Environmental Health and Human Health segments to ensure responsiveness to customer requirements as this realignment occurs. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily a result of the timing of disbursements during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, net, decreased cash provided by operating activities by $144.8 million for fiscal year 2013, and primarily related to the timing of payments for taxes, defined benefit pension plans, royalties, restructuring, and salary and benefits. During fiscal year 2013, we paid $40.3 million for prepaid royalties and we made contributions of $37.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States. We also contributed $20.2 million, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the United States during fiscal year 2013, which includes an additional contribution of $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom.

Investing Activities. Net cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations was $1.7 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to net cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations of $82.8 million for fiscal year 2012, 

44
a decrease of $81.1 million. Proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment was $52.2 million for fiscal year 2013, primarily due to the sale of a building located in Boston, Massachusetts for net proceeds of $47.6 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2013 were $39.0 million, primarily for manufacturing equipment and other capital equipment purchases, which included $5.9 million of capital improvements to leased buildings, which have been funded by the lessor, as described below in our financing lease obligations. For fiscal year 2013, we used $15.7 million of net cash for acquisitions and investments, as compared to $40.9 million used in fiscal year 2012. 

Financing Activities. Net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations was $154.2 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations of $44.2 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $110.0 million. For fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock, including 127,544 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $127.4 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases of 82,186 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $2.1 million, including commissions, for fiscal year 2012. This use of cash in fiscal year 2013 was partially offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $20.3 million. This compares to the proceeds from common stock option exercises of $34.2 million, including $1.8 million for the related excess tax benefit, for fiscal year 2012. During fiscal year 2013, borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled $677.0 million, which was offset by debt reductions of $538.0 million and the prepayment of our 2015 Notes of $150.0 million. This compares to borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $395.0 million, which was offset by debt reductions of $435.9 million in fiscal year 2012. We paid $31.6 million and $31.9 million in dividends during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. In fiscal year 2013, we paid a prepayment premium of $11.1 million for the redemption of our 2015 Notes and also received $1.4 million for settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts. This compares to $4.1 million received for the settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts during fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2012, we paid $0.4 million for debt issuance costs and $12.5 million in contingent consideration recorded at the acquisition date fair value. We also recorded $5.9 million and $5.5 million of financing for fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2012, respectively, related to capital improvements to leased buildings, which have been funded by the lessor, as described below in our financing lease obligations.

Fiscal Year 2012 

Operating Activities. Net cash provided by continuing operations was $153.6 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of $234.0 million for fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $80.4 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2012 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $68.4 million, and non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $126.9 million, impairment of assets charge of $74.2 million, the loss related to our postretirement benefit plans, including the mark-to-market adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 of $35.3 million, restructuring and contract termination charges, net, of $25.1 million, and stock based compensation expense of $21.0 million. These amounts were partially offset by a net increase in working capital of $60.7 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital for fiscal year 2012, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $44.6 million, an increase in inventory of $8.2 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $7.9 million. The increase in accounts receivable was a result of higher sales volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. The increase in inventory was primarily a result of realigning operations, research and development resources and production resources within our Environmental Health and Human Health segments to ensure responsiveness to customer requirements as this realignment occurs. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily a result of the timing of disbursements during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, net, decreased cash provided by operating activities by $136.7 million for fiscal year 2012, and primarily related to the timing of payments for taxes, restructuring, and salary and benefits.

Investing Activities. Net cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations was $82.8 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to net cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations of $942.1 million for fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $859.3 million. For fiscal year 2012, we used $40.9 million of net cash for acquisitions and investments, as compared to $914.0 million used in fiscal year 2011. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2012 were $42.4 million, primarily for manufacturing equipment and other capital equipment purchases, which included $5.5 million of capital improvements to leased buildings, which have been funded by the lessor, as described below in our financing lease obligations. Restricted cash balances decreased for fiscal year 2012 by $0.5 million, as compared to a decrease in restricted cash balances of $1.3 million for fiscal year 2011.

Financing Activities. Net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations was $44.2 million for fiscal year 2012, as compared to net cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations of $399.1 million for fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $443.3 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 82,186 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $2.1 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, including 84,243 

45
shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $110.0 million, including commissions, for fiscal year 2011. This use of cash in fiscal year 2012 was offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $34.2 million, including $1.8 million for the related excess tax benefit. This compares to the proceeds from common stock option exercises of $33.1 million, including $9.3 million for the related excess tax benefit, for fiscal year 2011. During fiscal year 2012, borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled $395.0 million, which was offset by debt reductions of $435.9 million. This compares to borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $787.0 million and net proceeds of $496.9 million from the issuance of our ten-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 5%, which was partially offset by debt reductions of $763.0 million in fiscal year 2011. We paid $31.9 million and $31.8 million in dividends during fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. In fiscal year 2012, we received $4.1 million for settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, we paid $0.4 million for debt issuance costs and we settled $12.5 million in contingent consideration recorded at the acquisition date fair value during fiscal year 2012, as compared to $10.5 million for debt issuance costs and $0.1 million in contingent consideration recorded at the acquisition date fair value during fiscal year 2011. We also recorded $5.5 million of financing related to capital improvements to leased buildings, which have been funded by the lessor, as described below in our financing lease obligations.

Borrowing Arrangements

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. On January 8, 2014, we refinanced our debt held under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our former senior unsecured revolving credit facility provided for $700.0 million of revolving loans and had an initial maturity of December 16, 2016. As of December 29, 2013, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $12.0 million were treated as issued and outstanding under the former senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 29, 2013, we had $291.0 million available for additional borrowing under the former facility. The interest rates under the former senior unsecured revolving credit facility were based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate was the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) one-month Libor plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 29, 2013 was 130 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of December 29, 2013 was 0.17%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 1.47%, which was the interest applicable to borrowings outstanding under the Eurocurrency rate as of December 29, 2013. At December 29, 2013 and December 30, 2012, we had $397.0 million and $258.0 million, respectively, of borrowings in U.S. Dollars outstanding under the former senior unsecured revolving credit facility with interest based primarily on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The credit agreement for the former facility contained affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in the credit agreement for our new credit facility. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 29, 2013. 

The new senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for $700.0 million of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of January 8, 2019. The interest rates under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility will be based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate will be the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) one-month Libor plus 1.00%. The new credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in the credit agreement for our previous facility. The financial covenants in our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility include a debt-to-capital ratio, and two contingent covenants, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. We use the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances.

6% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2015. On May 30, 2008, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2015 in a private placement and received $150.0 million of proceeds from the issuance. The 2015 Notes were scheduled to mature in May 2015 and paid interest at an annual rate of 6%. Interest on the 2015 Notes was payable semi-annually on May 30th and November 30th of each year. We had the option to redeem some or all of the 2015 Notes at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. In December 2013, we redeemed all of our 2015 Notes for a redemption price that included the outstanding principal amount of $150.0 million and a prepayment premium of $11.1 million, which is included in other expense, net. The transaction also resulted in the write-off of $2.8 million for the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and the write-off of $0.2 million for the remaining deferred debt issuance costs. Both of these amounts are included in interest expense.

5% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2021. On October 25, 2011, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2021 in a registered public offering and received $496.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2021 Notes were issued at 99.372% of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of $3.1 million. As of 

46
December 29, 2013, the 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of $497.4 million, net of $2.6 million of unamortized original issue discount. The 2021 Notes mature in November 2021 and bear interest at an annual rate of 5%. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th each year. Prior to August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 Notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes ) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 Notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holder's 2021 Notes for 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 29, 2013. 

Financing Lease Obligations. In September 2012, we entered into agreements with the lessors of buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. We provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, which resulted in us being considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, we will not be reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. We are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases will qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for us and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, we capitalized $29.3 million in property and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. We have also capitalized $11.5 million in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. At December 29, 2013, we had $40.3 million recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which $2.6 million was recorded as short-term debt and $37.7 million was recorded as long-term debt. At December 30, 2012, we had $34.6 million recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which $1.7 million was recorded as short-term debt and $32.9 million was recorded as long-term debt. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.

Dividends

Our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. At December 29, 2013, we had accrued $7.9 million for dividends declared on October 24, 2013 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, payable in February 2014. On January 24, 2014, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 that will be payable in May 2014. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

47
Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 29, 2013 for continuing and discontinued operations. Purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________________

(1) The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amount included in this table does not include interest obligations. On January 8, 2014, we refinanced our debt held under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with an initial maturity of January 8, 2019.

(2) The 2021 Notes include interest obligations.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(4) We do not expect to cash settle any uncertain tax positions during fiscal year 2014. We have excluded $20.2 million, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Capital Expenditures

During fiscal year 2014, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2013, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. 

Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

At December 29, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $173.2 million, of which $168.6 million was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we had $291.0 million of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We had no other liquid investments at December 29, 2013. 

We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Of the $168.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries at December 29, 2013, we would incur U.S. taxes on approximately $145.0 million if transferred to the U.S. without proper planning. We expect the remaining accumulated non-U.S. cash balances, that may not be transferred to the U.S. without incurring U.S. taxes, will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.

On October 24, 2012, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 6.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 24, 2014 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2013, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $123.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of December 29, 2013, approximately 2.4 million shares authorized by our Board under the Repurchase Program remained available for repurchase.

Our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 127,544 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $4.4 million.

The repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding, but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in 

48
connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

Distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.

Our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. With respect to plans outside of the United States, we expect to contribute $11.1 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2014. We could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. During fiscal year 2013, we made contributions of $37.0 million for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States. During fiscal year 2013, we contributed $20.2 million, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the United States, which includes an additional contribution of $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom. During fiscal year 2012, we made a contribution of $17.0 million for the 2011 plan year to our defined benefit pension plans in the United States, and $10.9 million in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the United States. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans. 

We entered into a strategic agreement in fiscal year 2012 under which we acquired certain intangible assets and received a license to certain core technology for an analytics and data discovery platform, as well as the exclusive right to distribute the platform in certain scientific research and development markets. During fiscal year 2012, we paid $6.8 million for net intangible assets and $25.0 million for prepaid royalties. During fiscal year 2013, we extended the existing agreement for an additional year. In addition, we entered into a new agreement to expand the distribution rights to the clinical and other related markets and acquired additional intangible assets. During fiscal year 2013, we paid $7.0 million for net intangible assets and $40.3 million for prepaid royalties. We do not expect to pay any additional prepaid royalties within the next twelve months. We expense royalties as revenue is recognized.

On August 22, 2013, we sold one of our facilities located in Boston, Massachusetts for net proceeds of $47.6 million. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the property, we entered into a lease agreement to lease back the property for our continued use. The lease has an initial term of 15 years and we have the right to extend the term of the lease for two additional periods of ten years each. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease and we have deferred $26.5 million of gains which will be amortized in operating expenses over the initial lease term of 15 years. During fiscal year 2013, we amortized $0.6 million of deferred gains related to the lease. At December 29, 2013, $25.9 million of these deferred gains remained to be amortized.

Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we adopted new guidance on additional disclosure requirements of other comprehensive income. This new guidance requires the presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into net income were not material for fiscal years 2013, 2012 or 2011. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. We believe that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows or do not apply to our operations. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, bad debts, inventories, accounting for business combinations and dispositions, long-lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other 

49
postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition. We record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. For revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of our products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as services are rendered. 

In limited circumstances, we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, such as cord blood processing and storage. For these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of our or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. BESP is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.

Revenue from software licenses and services was 5% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013, 3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012, and 2% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2011. We sell our software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. For the undelivered elements, we determine VSOE of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine VSOE for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period. We determine VSOE for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved.

We recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. If VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period. 

The majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.

Warranty costs. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period.

Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Accounts are written-off only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted.

Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for 

50
excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.

Business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.

Value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. 

Through fiscal year 2013, we conducted annual goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units: analytical sciences and laboratory services, diagnostics, life sciences technology and medical imaging. We completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of January 1, 2013 and January 2, 2012, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. At January 1, 2013, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 30.0% for each reporting unit. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future. As part of integrating our recent acquisitions, in fiscal year 2012, we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the PerkinElmer trade name. Accordingly, we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012. We concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names. We do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes. During fiscal year 2013, we recorded a charge of $6.7 million for the impairment of certain long-lived assets within our Human Health segment, as the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value. We recorded a charge of $3.0 million for the impairment of intangible assets during fiscal year 2011 within our Human Health segment for the full impairment of license agreements that we no longer intend to use. These non-cash impairments of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, have been recorded as a separate component of operating expenses.

Employee compensation and benefits. We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement. 

We recognized income of $18.2 million in fiscal year 2013, a loss of $35.3 million in fiscal year 2012 and a loss of $75.0 million in fiscal year 2011 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which includes the charge for the mark-to-market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans, which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter. The gain or expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pre-tax income of $17.6 million in fiscal year 2013, a pre-tax loss of $31.8 million in fiscal year 2012 and a pre-tax loss of $67.9 million in fiscal year 2011. We expect expenses of approximately $1.7 million in fiscal year 2014 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. It is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2014. Mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2014. Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2014. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year.

As of December 29, 2013, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the United States to be 7.25% and to be 5.30% for all plans outside the United States. In addition, as of December 29, 2013 we estimate the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the United States to be 4.77% and to be 3.77% for all plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date. 

If any of our assumptions were to change as of December 29, 2013, our pension plan expenses would also change.

We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

52
Restructuring activities. Our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (iii) impairment of assets as discussed above under “Value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges, net.”

Dispositions. When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013, we recorded $1.8 million in pre-tax losses from the disposition of discontinued operations. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings.

Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including state net operating loss carryforwards, state income tax credit carryforwards, and certain foreign tax attributes. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision.

Taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost. Our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements. As of December 29, 2013, the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the U.S. indefinitely and for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately $607.0 million. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.
