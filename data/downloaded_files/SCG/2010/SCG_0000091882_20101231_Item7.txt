ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 OVERVIEW  

 SCANA, through its wholly-owned regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in parts of South Carolina and in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Through a wholly-owned nonregulated subsidiary, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in Georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast. Other wholly-owned nonregulated subsidiaries provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units. A service company subsidiary of SCANA provides administrative, management and other services to SCANA and its subsidiaries.  

 The following map indicates areas where the Company's significant business segments conduct their activities, as further described in this overview section.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Key Earnings Drivers and Outlook 

 During 2010, the lingering effects of an economic recession showed modest signs of improvement in the southeast. At December 31, 2010 a preliminary estimate of seasonally adjusted unemployment nationwide was 9.4% compared to comparable unemployment rates in the states in which the Company primarily provides service (10.2% in Georgia, 9.8% in North Carolina and 10.7% in South Carolina). Though improved from December 2009, these unemployment rates remain stubbornly high and indicate that economic recovery in the southeast lags the nation. Customer growth rates in the Company's regulated and retail gas business segments were slightly positive in 2010, though customer usage within the regulated business segments continued to decline. The Company expects customer growth to be similar and usage patterns to continue in 2011.  

 Over the next five years, key earnings drivers for the Company will be additions to rate base at its regulated subsidiaries, consisting primarily of capital expenditures for new generating capacity, environmental facilities and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth and usage in each of the regulated utility businesses, earnings in the natural gas marketing business in Georgia and the level of growth of operation and maintenance expenses and taxes.  

 Electric Operations 

 The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2010 SCE&G provided electricity to approximately 660,600 customers in an area covering nearly 17,000 square miles. GENCO owns a coal-fired generating station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&G's nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission allowances.  

 Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. SCE&G's allowed return on equity is 10.7% for non-BLRA expenditures, and 11.0% for BLRA-related expenditures. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers' bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources.

 SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, has contracted with Westinghouse and Stone & Webster, Inc. for the design and construction of the New Units at the site of Summer Station. The contract provides that SCE&G and Santee Cooper will be joint owners and share operating costs and generation output of the New Units, with SCE&G responsible for 55 percent of the cost and receiving 55 percent of the output, and Santee Cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining 45 percent. Assuming timely receipt of federal approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled, the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in 2016, and the second in 2019.  

 SCE&G's latest Integrated Resource Plan filed with the SCPSC in February 2011 continues to support SCE&G's need for 55% of the output of the two units. As previously reported, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long-term power supply plan, including the level of its participation in the New Units. Santee Cooper has more recently indicated that it will seek to reduce its 45% ownership in the New Units. If Santee Cooper's ownership interest in one or both of the units changes, SCE&G believes that one or more additional parties will be available to participate as joint owners.  

 SCE&G is unable to predict whether any change in Santee Cooper's ownership interest or the addition of new joint owners will increase project costs or delay the commercial operation dates of the New Units. Any such project cost increase or delay could be material.  

 The successful completion of the project would result in a substantial increase of the Company's utility plant in service. Financing and managing the construction of these plants, together with continuing environmental construction projects, represents a significant challenge to the Company.  

 SCE&G expects to receive a COL for the New Units from the NRC in late 2011 or early 2012, which would support both the project schedule and the substantial completion dates for the New Units in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Environmental and safety reviews by the NRC are currently in progress and are part of the NRC's 30-month review schedule which began July 31, 2008.  

 In 2009, the SCPSC approved SCE&G's combined application pursuant to the BLRA seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review order relating to the proposed construction and operation by SCE&G and Santee Cooper of the New Units at Summer Station. Under the BLRA, the SCPSC conducted a full pre-construction prudency review of the proposed units and the engineering, procurement, and construction contract under which they are being built. The SCPSC prudency finding is binding on all future related rate proceedings so long as the construction proceeds in accordance with schedules, estimates and projections as approved by the SCPSC.  

 In May 2009, two intervenors filed separate appeals of the order with the South Carolina Supreme Court. With regard to the first appeal, which challenged the SCPSC's prudency finding, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion on April 26, 2010, affirming the decision of the SCPSC. As for the second appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the SCPSC's decision to allow SCE&G to include a pre-approved cost contingency amount associated inflation (contingency reserve) as part of its anticipated capital costs allowed under the BLRA. SCE&G's share of the project, as originally approved by the SCPSC, is $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars. Approximately $438 million of the anticipated capital costs (in 2007 dollars) represented contingency costs associated with the project. Without the pre-approved contingency reserve, SCE&G must seek SCPSC approval for the recovery of any additional capital costs. The Court's ruling, however, does not affect the project schedule or disturb the SCPSC's issuance of a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity, which is necessary to construct the New Units. On November 15, 2010, SCE&G filed a petition to the SCPSC seeking an order approving an updated capital cost schedule for the construction of the company's New Units that reflects the removal of the contingency reserve and incorporates presently identifiable additional capital costs of $173.9 million. A hearing on this petition is scheduled for April 4, 2011, and the SCPSC is expected to rule on the request in May 2011.

Table of Contents 

 In January 2010, the SCPSC approved SCE&G's request for an order pursuant to the BLRA to approve an updated construction and capital cost schedule for the construction of the New Units at Summer Station. The updated schedule provides details of the construction and capital cost schedule beyond what was proposed and included in the original BLRA filing. The revised schedule does not change the previously announced completion date for the New Units or the originally announced cost.  

 Under the BLRA, SCE&G is allowed to file revised rates with the SCPSC each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation. Requested rate adjustments are based on SCE&G's updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 11%, and have been approved by the SCPSC annually (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more details).  

 On January 27, 2011, SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, Westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&G's exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 passive reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. Westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Summer Station Unit 1 under a services alliance arrangement, and SCE&G has also contracted for Westinghouse to provide similar support services to the New Units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation in 2016 and 2019, respectively.  

 The Company expects that significant federal legislative initiatives related to energy, will be hampered through 2012 due to each chamber of Congress being controlled by different political parties. Significant regulatory initiatives by the EPA and other federal agencies, however, will likely proceed. These initiatives may require the Company to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity from energy sources that exclude fossil fuels, nuclear or hydro facilities (for example, under an RES). New legislation or regulations may also impose stringent requirements on existing power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such initiatives will be enacted, and if they are, the conditions they would impose on utilities.  

 The EPA has publicly stated its intention to propose new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCR, such as ash. Such regulations could result in the treatment of some CCRs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities, such as SCE&G and GENCO. While the Company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be, the Company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates.  

 Gas Distribution 

 The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy and is primarily engaged in the purchase, transportation and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. At December 31, 2010 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 795,500 customers in areas covering 34,600 square miles.  

 Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity.  

 Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes  

38 

Table of Contents 

with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact the Company's ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. One effect of the recent economic recession was an overall decrease in demand for natural gas which, coupled with discoveries of shale gas in the United States, resulted in significantly lower prices for this commodity in 2009 and 2010.  

 Retail Gas Marketing 

 SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, comprises the retail gas marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas to approximately 460,000 customers (as of December 31, 2010, and includes regulated division customers described below) throughout Georgia. SCANA Energy's total customer base represents an approximately 30% share of the customers in Georgia's deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA Energy's competitors include an affiliate of a large energy company with experience in Georgia's energy market, as well as several electric membership cooperatives. SCANA Energy's ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors, its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors.  

 As Georgia's regulated provider, SCANA Energy provides service to low-income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the GPSC, and SCANA Energy receives funding from the Universal Service Fund to offset some of the bad debt associated with the low-income group. SCANA Energy's contract to serve as Georgia's regulated provider of natural gas is for a term ending August 31, 2012. SCANA Energy files financial and other information periodically with the GPSC, and such information is available at www.psc.state.ga.us (which is not intended as an active hyperlink; the information on the GPSC website is not part of this or any other report filed with the SEC). Included in the above customer count, SCANA Energy's regulated division served approximately 90,000 customers (as of December 31, 2010).  

 SCANA Energy and SCANA's other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and other financial instruments, including commodity swaps and futures contracts, to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. As a part of this risk management process, at any given time, a portion of SCANA's projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract. Since SCANA Energy operates in a competitive market, it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and/or pricing, thereby reducing expected margins and profitability. Further, there can be no assurance that Georgia's gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve.  

 Energy Marketing 

 The divisions of SEMI excluding SCANA Energy comprise the energy marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy-related risk management services to customers.  

 The operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control growth of costs. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. In addition, certain pipeline capacity available for Energy Marketing to serve industrial and other customers is dependent upon the market share held by SCANA Energy in the retail market.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Diluted Earnings Per Share  

 In May 2010, SCANA entered into equity forward sales contracts for approximately 6.6 million common shares. During periods when the average market price of SCANA's common stock is above the per share adjusted forward sales price, the Company computes diluted earnings per share giving effect to this dilutive potential common stock utilizing the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect was $.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2010.  

 Pension Cost (Income)  

 Pension cost (income) was recorded on the Company's income statements and balance sheets as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In connection with the SCPSC's July 2010 electric rate order, SCE&G began deferring all pension expense related to retail electric operations as a regulatory asset. These amounts will be deferred until future rate recovery is provided for by the SCPSC. From January 2009 until the July 2010 order, the  

40 

Table of Contents 

SCPSC allowed SCE&G to mitigate a significant portion of pension cost by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level of pension income which was included in rates. This pension cost arose due to the significant decline in plan asset values during the fourth quarter of 2008 stemming from turmoil in the financial markets. The Company had recorded significant pension income in 2008.  

 No contribution to the pension trust was necessary, nor did limitations on benefit payments apply, in or for any period reported.  

 AFC  

 AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 5.6% of income before income taxes in 2010, 9.8% in 2009 and 5.6% in 2008, respectively.  

 Electric Operations 

 Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margin (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  2010 vs 2009   Margin increased by $37.0 million due to higher SCPSC-approved retail electric base rates in July 2010 and by $30.7 million due to an increase in base rates approved by the SCPSC under the BLRA. In addition, margin increased by $54.2 million (net of eWNA after its implementation) due to weather, by $5.8 million due to higher transmission revenue and off-system sales and by $13.6 million due to the adoption of SCPSC-approved lower electric depreciation rates in 2009, the effect of which was offset by a reduction in the recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue). During the first quarter of 2010, the Company deferred $25 million of incremental revenue as a result of the abnormally cold weather in SCE&G's service territory (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Also, margin in the first quarter of 2010 was adjusted downward by $17.4 million pursuant to an SCPSC regulatory order issued in connection with SCE&G's annual fuel cost proceeding. (See also discussion at "Income Taxes".) Finally, pursuant to the SCPSC-approved retail electric base rate order in 2010, SCE&G adopted an eWNA thereby mitigating the effects of abnormal weather on its margins.     

41 

Table of Contents 

  2009 vs 2008    Margin decreased by $6.6 million due to lower residential and commercial usage (including the partially offsetting effects of favorable weather), by $11.9 million due to lower industrial sales, by lower off-system sales of $15.9 million. Margin also decreased by $13.6 million due to the adoption of new, lower SCPSC-approved electric depreciation rates, the effect of which was offset within operating revenues. The decreases were partially offset by higher residential and commercial customer growth of $6.2 million and by increases in base rates by the SCPSC under the BLRA of $10.8 million which became effective for bills rendered on or after March 29, 2009.     

 Sales volumes (in MWh) related to the electric margin above, by class, were as follows:

 Gas Distribution 

 Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy. Gas distribution sales margin (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  2010 vs 2009   Margin at SCE&G increased by $9.2 million due to an SCPSC-approved increase in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2009 and $3.3 million due to increased customer usage. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million due to an SCPSC-approved decrease in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2010. Margin at PSNC Energy increased by $4.0 million primarily due to residential customer growth and improved industrial usage.     

42 

Table of Contents 

  2009 vs 2008    Margin increased by $2.7 million due to an SCPSC-approved increase in retail gas base rates at SCE&G which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2008 and by $3.7 million due to an SCPSC-approved increase in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2009, both of which were offset by a decrease of $3.0 million due to lower customer usage at SCE&G. The NCUC-approved rate increase at PSNC Energy, for services rendered on or after November 1, 2008, increased margin by $6.6 million.     

 Sales volumes (in DT) by class, including transportation gas, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Resolution of EIZ Credits  

 In September 2009, as a result of a favorable decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court regarding SCE&G's EIZ Credits, SCE&G recorded the refund of the previously contested EIZ Credits of $15.3 million and an additional $14.3 million of interest income. SCE&G recorded a multi-year catch-up adjustment in the third quarter 2009 of approximately $6.3 million ($4.0 million after federal tax effect) as a reduction in income taxes. The interest income of $14.3 million ($8.8 million after tax effect) was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 within other income.  

 Interest Expense 

 Components of interest expense, net of the debt component of AFC, were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Interest on long-term debt increased in each year primarily due to increased long-term borrowings over the prior year. Other interest expense decreased in each year primarily due to lower principal balances on short-term debt over the prior year.  

 Income Taxes 

 Income tax expense (and the effective tax rate) decreased in 2010 primarily due to the recognition of certain previously deferred state income tax credits pursuant to both the settlement of a fuel cost proceeding in the first quarter of 2010 and the retail electric base rate increase in July 2010. (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciling differences between income tax expense and statutory tax expense.) Income tax expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to the resolution of the contested EIZ Credits in favor of the Company (see discussion above at Other Income (Expense)) and changes in operating income.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds, the incurrence of additional short- and long-term indebtedness and sales of equity securities. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 2.92.  

 Cash requirements for SCANA's regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief.  

 The Company also obtains equity from SCANA's stock plans. Shares of SCANA common stock are acquired on behalf of participants in SCANA's Investor Plus Plan and Stock Purchase-Savings Plan through the original issuance of shares, rather than being purchased on the open market. This provided approximately $94 million of additional equity during 2010 and is expected to provide approximately $95 million in 2011. Due primarily to new nuclear construction plans, the Company anticipates keeping this strategy in place for the foreseeable future.  

 The Company also expects to issue common stock under forward contracts executed in 2010. In order to facilitate the issuance of additional equity to fund capital expenditures for normal operations and new nuclear as well as to provide shares for issuance under compensation plans and for future business opportunities that may require the issuance of common stock, at the 2011 Annual Meeting, our Board is proposing to amend SCANA's articles of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock which are authorized for issuance from 150,000,000 to 200,000,000.  

 SCANA's leverage ratio of debt to capital was approximately 57% at December 31, 2010. SCANA has publicly announced its desire to maintain its leverage ratio at levels between 54% and 57%, but SCANA's ability to do so depends on a number of factors. In the future, if SCANA is not able to maintain its leverage ratio within the desired range, the Company's debt ratings may be affected, it may be required to pay higher interest rates on its long- and short-term indebtedness, and its access to the capital markets may be limited.  

Capital Expenditures  

 Cash outlays for property additions and construction expenditures, including nuclear fuel, net of AFC, were $876 million in 2010 and are estimated to be $1.1 billion in 2011.

 The Company's current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for 2011-2013, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows:  

 Estimated Capital Expenditures 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The Company's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2010 are summarized as follows:  

 Contractual Cash Obligations 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Included in the table above in purchase obligations is SCE&G's portion of a contractual agreement for the design and construction of the new units at the Summer Station site. SCE&G expects to be a joint owner and share operating costs and generation output of the new units, with SCE&G accounting for 55 percent of the cost and output and the other joint owner(s) the remaining 45 percent. Assuming timely receipt of federal approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled, the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in 2016, and the second in 2019. SCE&G's estimated projected costs for the two additional units, in future dollars and excluding AFC, are summarized below. To the extent that actual contracts were put in place by December 31, 2010, obligations arising from these contracts are included in the purchase obligations within the Contractual Cash Obligations table above.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Also included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the Company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. The Company may terminate such arrangements without penalty.  

47 

           Table of Contents  

 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases. Forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary "make-whole" or default provisions, but are not considered to be "take-or-pay" contracts. Certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses; therefore, the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates. Also included in other commercial commitments is a "take-and-pay" contract for natural gas which expires in 2019 and estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded under current regulations, and no significant contributions are anticipated until after 2011. Cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were $11.7 million in 2010, and such annual payments are expected to be the same or increase up to $14.1 million in the future.  

 In addition, the Company is party to certain NYMEX futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. See further discussion at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. At December 31, 2010, the Company had posted $1.9 million in cash collateral for such contracts. In addition, the Company had posted $20 million in cash collateral for interest rate derivative contracts.  

 The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station Unit 1 and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations table. See Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  

Financing Limits and Related Matters  

 The Company's issuance of various securities, including long-term and short-term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and FERC. Financing programs currently utilized by the Company follow.  

 SCE&G and GENCO have obtained FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness (pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act). SCE&G may issue up to $1.2 billion of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less, and GENCO may issue up to $150 million of short-term indebtedness. The authority to make such issuances will expire in October 2012.  

 On October 25, 2010, SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy entered into Five-Year Credit Agreements in the amounts of $300 million, $1.1 billion (of which $400 million relates to Fuel Company) and $100 million, respectively, which are scheduled to expire October 23, 2015. These credit agreements are used for general corporate purposes, including liquidity support for each company's commercial paper program, and working capital needs and, in the case of Fuel Company, to finance or refinance the purchase of nuclear fuel, fossil fuel, and emission and other environmental allowances. These committed long-term facilities are revolving lines of credit under credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N. A. and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. each provide 10% of the aggregate $1.5 billion credit facilities, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., TD Bank N.A. and UBS Loan Finance LLC each provide 8%, and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Union Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association each provide 5.3%. Three other banks provide the remaining 6%. These bank credit facilities support the issuance of commercial paper by SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy. When the commercial paper markets are dislocated (due to either price or availability constraints), the  

48 

Table of Contents 

credit facilities are available to support the borrowing needs of SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy.  

 At December 31, 2010 and 2009, SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy had available the following committed LOC and had outstanding the following LOC advances, commercial paper, and LOC-supported letter of credit obligations:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)The Company's committed long-term facilities serve to back-up the issuance of commercial paper or to provide liquidity support. Subsequent to execution of the five year credit agreements described above, commercial paper could be issued in amounts up to $300 million by SCANA, $700 million by SCE&G, $400 million by Fuel Company and $100 million by PSNC Energy.   

 As of December 31, 2010, the Company had not borrowed from its $1.5 billion credit facilities, had approximately $420 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding, was obligated under $3.3 million in LOC supported letters of credit, and held approximately $52 million in cash and temporary investments. The Company regularly monitors the commercial paper and short-term credit markets to optimize the timing for repayment of the outstanding balance on its draws, while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity. Average short-term borrowings outstanding during 2010 were approximately $330 million. Short-term cash needs were met through a variety of methods in the first part of 2010, including issuance of commercial paper and draws against credit facilities. By year end, all short-term needs were being met with commercial paper due to more favorable interest rates and market liquidity.  

 At December 31, 2010, the Company had net available liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion. The Company's long-term debt portfolio has a weighted average maturity of almost 15 years and bears an average cost of 6.4%. A significant portion of long-term debt, other than credit facility draws, effectively bears fixed interest rates or is swapped to fixed. To further preserve liquidity, the Company rigorously reviews its projected capital expenditures and operating costs and adjusts them where possible without impacting safety, reliability, and core customer service.  

 The Company's articles of incorporation do not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. However, SCANA's junior subordinated indenture (relating to the hereinafter defined Hybrids), SCE&G's bond indenture (relating to the hereinafter defined Bonds) and PSNC Energy's note purchase and debenture purchase agreements each contain provisions that, under certain circumstances, which the Company considers to be remote, could limit the payment of cash dividends on their respective common stock.  

 With respect to hydroelectric projects, the Federal Power Act requires the appropriation of a portion of certain earnings therefrom. At December 31, 2010, approximately $58 million of retained earnings were restricted by this requirement as to payment of cash dividends on SCE&G's common stock.

 SCANA Corporation   

 SCANA has in effect an indenture which permits the issuance of unsecured debt securities from time to time including its medium-term notes. This indenture contains no specific limit on the amount of unsecured debt securities which may be issued.  

 SCANA has outstanding $150 million of enhanced junior subordinated notes (Hybrids) bearing an interest rate of 7.70% and maturing on January 30, 2065, subject to extension to January 30, 2080. Because their structure and terms are characteristic of both debt instruments and equity securities, the rating agencies consider securities like the Hybrids to be hybrid debt instruments and give some "equity credit" to the issuers of such securities for purposes of computing leverage ratios of debt to capital. The Hybrids are only subject to redemption at SCANA's option and may be redeemed at any time, although the redemption prices payable by SCANA differ depending on the timing of the redemption and the circumstances (if any) giving rise thereto.  

 In connection with the Hybrids, SCANA executed an RCC in favor of the holders of certain designated debt (referred to as "covered debt"). Under the terms of the RCC, SCANA agreed not to redeem or repurchase all or part of the Hybrids prior to the termination date of the RCC, unless it uses the proceeds of certain qualifying securities sold to non-affiliates within 180 days prior to the redemption or repurchase date. The proceeds SCANA receives from such qualifying securities, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must exceed the redemption or repurchase price of the Hybrids. Qualifying securities include common stock, and other securities that generally rank equal to or junior to the Hybrids and include distribution, deferral and long-dated maturity features similar to the Hybrids. For purposes of the RCC, non-affiliates include (but are not limited to) individuals enrolled in SCANA's dividend reinvestment plan, direct stock purchase plan and employee benefit plans.  

 The RCC is scheduled to terminate on the earliest to occur of the following: (a) January 30, 2035 (or later, if the maturity date of the Hybrids is extended), (b) the date on which SCANA no longer has any eligible debt which ranks senior in right of payment to the Hybrids, (c) the date on which the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of "covered debt" agree to the termination thereof or (d) the date on which the Hybrids are accelerated following an event of default with respect thereto. SCANA's $250 million in Medium Term Notes due April 1, 2020 were initially designated as "covered debt" under the RCC.   

 South Carolina Electric & Gas Company   

 SCE&G is subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its first mortgage bonds (Bonds) have been issued. Bonds may be issued under the Mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of (1) 70% of Unfunded Net Property Additions (as therein defined), (2) the aggregate principal amount of retired Bonds and (3) cash deposited with the trustee. Bonds, other than certain Bonds issued on the basis of retired Bonds, may be issued under the Mortgage only if Adjusted Net Earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice (2.0) the annual interest requirements on all outstanding Bonds and Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Bond Ratio was 5.36.  

Financing Activities  

 In February 2011, PSNC Energy issued $150 million of 4.59% unsecured senior notes due February 14, 2021. Proceeds from these notes were used to retire PSNC Energy's $150 million medium term notes due February 15, 2011. In January 2011, SCE&G issued $250 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds maturing on February 1, 2041. Proceeds from the sale were used to retire SCE&G's $150 million First Mortgage Bonds due February 1, 2011 and for general corporate purposes. The  

50 

Table of Contents 

borrowings refinanced by these 2011 issuances are classified within Long-term Debt, Net in the consolidated balance sheet.  

 During 2010 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $33 million primarily due to repayment of long-term debt and payment of dividends, partially offset by issuances of common stock and short and long-term debt.  

 In March 2010, PSNC Energy issued $100 million of 6.54% unsecured notes due March 30, 2020. Proceeds from these notes were used to pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.  

 On May 17, 2010, SCANA issued common stock valued at $59.2 million (at time of issue) in a public offering and entered into forward sale agreements of approximately 6.6 million shares to be sold over the subsequent 22 months. There have been no shares issued under the forward sale agreements.  

 For additional information on significant financing activities, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 In February 2011, SCANA increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on SCANA common stock to $.485 per share, an increase of 2.1% from the prior declared dividend. The dividend is payable April 1, 2011 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2011.  

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  

 The Company's regulated operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes. Applicable statutes and rules include the CAA, CAIR, CWA, Nuclear Waste Act and the CERCLA, among others. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, which the Company expects to recover through existing ratemaking provisions.  

 For the three years ended December 31, 2010, the Company's capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at its fossil fuel generating stations totaled $373.9 million. In addition, the Company made expenditures to operate and maintain environmental control equipment at its fossil plants of $6.5 million during 2010, $5.6 million during 2009, and $5.8 million during 2008, which are included in "Other operation and maintenance" expense and made expenditures to handle waste ash of $5.9 million in 2010, $6.5 million in 2009, and $4.9 million in 2008, which are included in "Fuel used in electric generation." In addition, included within "Other operation and maintenance" expense is annual amortization of $1.4 million in each of 2010, 2009, and 2008 related to SCE&G's recovery of MGP remediation costs as approved by the SCPSC. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $14.5 million for 2011 and $113.3 million for the four-year period 2011-2015. These expenditures are included in the Company's Estimated Capital Expenditures table, are discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include known costs related to the matters discussed below.  

 On June 26, 2009, the United States House of Representatives narrowly passed energy legislation that would mandate significant reductions in GHG emissions and require electric utilities to generate an increasing percentage of their power from renewable sources. The United States Senate considered but did not pass legislation that would address GHG emissions and would establish an RES. The Company cannot predict if or when any such energy legislation will become law or what requirements would be imposed on the Company by such legislation. The Company expects that any costs incurred to comply with such legislation would be recoverable through rates.  

 At the state level, no significant environmental legislation that would affect the Company's operations advanced during 2010. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be introduced or enacted in 2011, or if new regulations or changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be implemented in the coming year.

 Air Quality  

 With the pervasive emergence of concern over the issue of global climate change as a significant influence upon the economy, SCANA, SCE&G and GENCO are subject to certain climate-related financial risks, including those involving regulatory requirements responsive to GHG emissions, as well as those involving physical impacts which could arise from global climate change. Certain other business and financial risks arising from such climate change could also arise. The Company cannot predict all of the climate-related regulatory and physical risks nor the related consequences which might impact the Company, and the following discussion should not be considered all-inclusive.  

 From a regulatory perspective, SCANA, SCE&G and GENCO continually monitor and evaluate their current and projected emission levels and strive to comply with all state and federal regulations regarding those emissions. SCE&G and GENCO participate in the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance programs with respect to coal plant emissions and also have constructed additional pollution control equipment at several larger coal-fired electric generating plants. Further, SCE&G has announced plans to construct the New Units which are expected to significantly reduce GHG emission levels once they are completed and dispatched, potentially displacing some of the current coal-fired generation sources.  

 See also the discussion of the court action on the CAIR below. Even while the rule has been remanded, the requirements are still in effect thus requiring the scrubber and SCR projects.  

 In 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR which requires the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. CAIR set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and beginning in 2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur dioxide. Numerous states, environmental organizations, industry groups and individual companies challenged the rule, seeking a change in the method CAIR used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances. On December 23, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the rule but did not vacate it. Prior to the Court of Appeals' decision, SCE&G and GENCO had determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the CAIR requirements. SCE&G has completed the installation of SCR technology at Cope Station for nitrogen oxide reduction and GENCO has completed installation of a wet limestone scrubber at Williams Station for sulfur dioxide reduction. SCE&G also installed a wet limestone scrubber at Wateree Station. The Company has incurred capital expenditures totaling approximately $517 million through 2010 for these projects. The EPA has proposed a revised rule which is currently being reviewed by the Company. Any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the EPA in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates.  

 In June 2010, the EPA issued a final rule for a one-hour ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide emissions. Initial evaluation of this new standard indicated that SCE&G's McMeekin Station in Lexington County may be required to reduce its sulfur dioxide emissions to a level determined by EPA and/or DHEC. The costs incurred to comply with this new standard are expected to be recovered through rates.  

 Physical effects associated with climate changes could include the impact of possible changes in weather patterns, such as storm frequency and intensity, and the resultant potential damage to the Company's electric system, as well as impacts on customers and on the Company's supply chain and many others. Much of the service territory of SCE&G is subject to the damaging effects of Atlantic and Gulf coast hurricanes and also to the damaging impact of winter ice storms. To help mitigate the financial risks arising from these potential occurrences, SCE&G maintains insurance on certain properties and has collected funds from customers for its storm damage reserve (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). As part of its ongoing operations, SCE&G maintains emergency response and storm preparation plans and teams, and applicable personnel participate in ongoing

training and related simulations in advance of such storms, all in order to allow the Company to protect its assets and to return its systems to normal reliable operation in a timely fashion following any such event.  

 In December 2009, the EPA issued a final finding that atmospheric concentrations of GHG endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of Section 202(a) of the CAA. The rule, which became effective in January 2010, enables the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA. The EPA has committed to issue new rules regulating such emissions by November 2011. On May 13, 2010, the EPA finalized the GHG Tailoring Rule, which sets thresholds for GHG emissions that define when permits under the New Source Review, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, and the Title V Operation Permits programs are required for new and existing facilities (such as SCE&G's and GENCO's generating facilities). The Company expects that any costs incurred to comply with GHG emission requirements will be recoverable through rates.  

 In 2005 the EPA issued the CAMR which established a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal-fired power plants. Numerous parties challenged the rule, and on February 8, 2008, the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units. The Company expects the EPA to issue a new rule on mercury emissions in 2011 but cannot predict what requirements it will impose.  

 The EPA is conducting an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry related to the new source review provisions and the new source performance standards of the CAA. As part of the initiative, many utilities have received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA. In addition, the DOJ, on behalf of EPA, has taken civil enforcement action against several utilities. The primary basis for these actions is the assertion by EPA that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities at their coal-fired power plants constituted "major modifications" which required the installation of costly BACT. Some of the utilities subject to the actions have reached settlement.  

 To date, SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The current state of continued DOJ civil enforcement is the subject of industry-wide speculation, and it cannot be determined whether the Company will be affected by the initiative in the future. The Company believes that any enforcement action relative to its compliance with the CAA would be without merit. The Company further believes that installation of equipment responsive to CAIR previously discussed will mitigate many of the alleged concerns with NSR.  

 Water Quality  

 The CWA provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the CWA, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued and renewed for all of SCE&G's and GENCO's generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for new cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The EPA has said that it will issue a rule that modifies requirements for existing intake structures by mid March 2011. The Company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the CWA. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity-based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, SCE&G and GENCO. The Company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates.

 Hazardous and Solid Wastes  

 The EPA has publicly stated its intention to propose new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCRs, such as ash, in 2011. Such regulations could result in the treatment of some CCRs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities, such as SCE&G and GENCO. While the Company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be, the Company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates.  

 The Nuclear Waste Act required that the United States government accept and permanently dispose of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste with the DOE in 1983. As of December 31, 2010, the federal government has not accepted any spent fuel from Summer Station Unit 1 or any other nuclear generating facility, and it remains unclear when the repository may become available. SCE&G has on-site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2017 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of Summer Station Unit 1 through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available.  

 The provisions of CERCLA authorize the EPA to require the clean-up of hazardous waste sites. In addition, the states of South Carolina and North Carolina have similar laws. The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean-up. In addition, regulators from the EPA and other federal or state agencies periodically notify the Company that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean-up relate solely to regulated operations. Such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized, with recovery provided through rates. The Company has assessed the following matters:   

Electric Operations   

 SCE&G has been named, along with 53 others, by the EPA as a PRP at the AER Superfund site located in Augusta, Georgia. The PRPs funded a Remedial Investigation and Risk Assessment which was completed and approved by the EPA and funded a Feasibility Study that was completed in 2010. A clean-up cost has been estimated and the PRPs have agreed to an allocation of those costs based primarily on volume and type of material each PRP sent to the site. SCE&G's allocation will not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost allocated to SCE&G arising from the remediation of this site is expected to be recoverable through rates.   

Gas Distribution   

 SCE&G is responsible for four decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by-product chemicals. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until 2012 and will cost an additional $8.9 million. In addition, the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior has made an initial demand to SCE&G for payment of $9.1 million for certain costs and damages relating to the MGP site in Charleston, South Carolina. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of these four sites through rates. At December 31, 2010, deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $26.4 million, and are included in regulatory assets.  

54 

           Table of Contents  

 PSNC Energy is responsible for environmental clean up at five sites in North Carolina on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energy's actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as actual site conditions, third-party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. PSNC Energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of $4.2 million, the estimated remaining liability at December 31, 2010. PSNC Energy expects to recover through rates any costs allocable to PSNC Energy arising from the remediation of these sites.  

 REGULATORY MATTERS  

 Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 SCANA is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC as to the issuance of certain securities and other matters and is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC as to certain acquisitions and other matters.  

 South Carolina Electric & Gas Company  

 SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC as to the issuance of certain securities and other matters; the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings) and other matters; and FERC as to issuance of short-term borrowings, certain acquisitions and other matters.  

 GENCO is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings) and is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC as to issuance of short-term borrowings, accounting, certain acquisitions and other matters.  

 SCE&G and GENCO are subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act, administered by FERC and DOE, in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and in the sale of electric energy at wholesale for resale, as well as with respect to licensed hydroelectric projects and certain other matters, including accounting.  

 Natural gas distribution companies may request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC.  

 Effective February 12, 2010, the PHMSA issued a final rule establishing integrity management requirements for gas distribution pipeline systems, similar to those for transmission pipelines discussed below. The rule gives SCE&G until August 2, 2011 to develop and implement a program for compliance with the rule. SCE&G is in the process of developing the plan and procedures to ensure that it will be fully compliant with the new law. SCE&G believes that any additional costs incurred to comply with the rule will be recoverable through rates.  

 Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated  

 PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters.  

 The Pipeline Safety Act directed the DOT to establish the Integrity Management Rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations. Of PSNC Energy's approximately 593 miles of transmission pipeline subject to the Pipeline Safety Act, approximately 63 miles are located within these areas. Through December 2010, PSNC Energy has assessed 98 percent of the pipeline and is required to complete its assessment of the remainder by December 2012. PSNC Energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline approximately every seven years. PSNC Energy currently estimates the total costs through December  

55 

Table of Contents 

2012 to be $8.1 million for the initial assessments, not including any subsequent remediation that may be required. Costs totaling $2.3 million are being recovered through rates over a three-year period beginning November 1, 2008. The NCUC has authorized continuation of deferral accounting for certain costs incurred to comply with DOT's pipeline integrity management requirements until resolution of PSNC Energy's next general rate proceeding.  

 Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation  

 CGT has approximately 72 miles of transmission line that are covered by the Integrity Management Rule of the Pipeline Safety Act. CGT currently estimates the total cost to be $8.3 million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through December 2012.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Following are descriptions of the Company's accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations.  

Utility Regulation  

 SCANA's regulated utilities record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods in accordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated utilities. In the future, in the event of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria of accounting for rate-regulated utilities, and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company's and SCE&G's Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write-off would be recorded. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company's regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Company's environmental assessment program.  

 The Company's generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write-downs would be necessary and, if they were, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Company's results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2010, the Company's net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.  

Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues  

 Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of the Company's utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers for which they have not yet been billed. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. Accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $221.1 million at December 31, 2010 and $187.2 million at December 31, 2009, compared to total revenues of $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Nuclear Decommissioning  

 Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&G's accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Company's financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings-neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers).  

 SCE&G's two-thirds share of estimated site-specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station Unit 1, including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination, totals $451.0 million, stated in 2006 dollars. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one-third ownership interest in Summer Station Unit 1. The cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use.  

 Under SCE&G's method of funding decommissioning costs, amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds and interest thereon, less expenses. The trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies and cash held by the trust. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after-tax basis.  

Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits  

 The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and changes in funded status as a component of net periodic benefit cost or other comprehensive income, net of tax, or as a regulatory asset as required by accounting guidance. The Company's plan is adequately funded under current regulations. Accounting guidance requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting pension cost or income recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension cost of $23.5 million recorded in 2010 reflects the use of a 5.75% discount rate, derived using a cash flow matching technique, and an assumed 8.50% long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension cost amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.50% in 2010 would have increased the Company's pension cost by $1.2 million. Had the assumed long-term rate of return on assets been 8.25%, the Company's pension cost for 2010 would have increased by $1.8 million.  

 The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted.  

 The Company determines the fair value of a majority of its pension assets utilizing market quotes or derives them from modeling techniques that incorporate market data. Only a small portion of assets are valued using less transparent (so-called "Level 3") methods.  

 In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluates historical performance, targeted allocation amounts and expected payment terms. As of the beginning of 2010, the plan's historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 4.0%, 9.0%, 9.2% and 10.6%, respectively. The 2010 expected long-term rate of return of 8.5% was based on a target asset allocation of 65% with equity managers and 35% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. As of the beginning of 2011, the plan's historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year  

57 

Table of Contents 

cumulative performance showed actual returns of 4.2%, 8.1%, 9.8% and 10.2%, respectively. For 2011, the expected rate of return is 8.25%.  

 As noted in Results of Operations, due to turmoil in the financial markets and the resultant declines in plan asset values in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded significant amounts of pension cost in 2009 and 2010 compared to the pension income recorded in 2008 and previously. However, in February 2009, SCE&G was granted accounting orders by the SCPSC which allowed it to mitigate a significant portion of this increased pension cost by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level that was included in then current cost of service rates for its retail electric and gas distribution regulated operations. In July 2010, upon the new retail electric base rates becoming effective, SCE&G began deferring, as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated retail electric operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. In November 2010, upon the updated gas rates becoming effective under the RSA, SCE&G began deferring as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated natural gas operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense.  

 The pension trust is adequately funded under current regulations, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make significant pension contributions until after 2011.  

 The Company accounts for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans in a similar manner to that used for its defined benefit pension plan. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. The Company used a discount rate of 5.90%, derived using a cash flow matching technique, and recorded a net cost of $17.8 million for 2010. Had the selected discount rate been 5.65%, the expense for 2010 would have been $0.4 million higher. Because the plan provisions include "caps" on company per capita costs, healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded.  

Asset Retirement Obligations  

 The Company accrues for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The obligations are recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred, and associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. Because such obligations relate primarily to the Company's regulated utility operations, their recording has no significant impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded an ARO of $117 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and an ARO of $380 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines. All of the amounts recorded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments may be made many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time; however, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the utilities remains in place.  

 OTHER MATTERS  

Nuclear Generation  

 SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, has contracted with Westinghouse and Stone & Webster, Inc. for the design and construction of the New Units at the site of Summer Station. The contract provides that SCE&G and Santee Cooper will be joint owners and share operating costs and generation output of the New Units, with SCE&G responsible for 55 percent of the cost and receiving

55 percent of the output, and Santee Cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining 45 percent. Assuming timely receipt of federal approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled, the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in 2016, and the second in 2019. SCE&G's share of the estimated cash outlays (future value) totals approximately $5.5 billion for plant costs and for related transmission infrastructure costs, which costs are projected based on historical one-year and five year escalation rates as required by the SCPSC.  

 SCE&G's latest Integrated Resource Plan filed with the SCPSC on February 2011, continues to support SCE&G's need for 55% of the output of the two units. As previously reported, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long-term power supply plan, including the level of its participation in the New Units. Santee Cooper has more recently indicated that it will seek to reduce its 45% ownership in the New Units. If Santee Cooper's ownership interest in one or both of the units changes, SCE&G believes that one or more additional parties will be available to participate as joint owners.  

 SCE&G is unable to predict whether any change in Santee Cooper's ownership interest or the addition of new joint owners will increase project costs or delay the commercial operation dates of the New Units. Any such project cost increase or delay could be material.  

Fuel Contract  

 On January 27, 2011, SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, Westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&G's exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 passive reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. Westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Summer Station Unit 1 under a services alliance arrangement, and SCE&G has also contracted for Westinghouse to provide similar support services to the New Units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation in 2016 and 2019, respectively.  

Financial Regulatory Reform  

 In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act became law. This Act provides for substantial additional regulation of over-the-counter and security-based derivative instruments, among other things, and requires numerous rule-makings by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC to implement. The Company is currently complying with these enacted regulations and intends to comply with regulations enacted in the future but cannot predict when the final regulations will be issued or what requirements they will impose.  

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions  

 Although SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold significant investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities. SCANA does not engage in off-balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture, vehicles, equipment and rail cars.
