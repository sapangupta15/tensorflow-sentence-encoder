 Executive Summary  

 The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with non-competing products, including digital games, offered by third parties. The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the second half of the year accounted for 63%, 66% and 68% of the Companys net revenues, respectively. While many of the Companys products are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties, such as MARVEL and STAR WARS properties.  

 The Companys business is primarily separated into two business segments, U.S. and Canada and International. The U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the U.S. and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South American marketing operations, including Mexico. In addition to these two primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment. The Companys Other segment is responsible for the worldwide out-licensing of the Companys intellectual properties and works closely with the U.S. and Canada and International segments on the development and out-licensing of the Companys brands. Prior to 2008, the Companys Mexican operations were included with the U.S. and Canada in the North American segment. At the beginning of 2008 the Company reorganized the management and reporting structure of its operating segments and moved the Mexican operations into the International segment and the North American segment was renamed the U.S. and Canada segment. The management reorganization was the result of a realignment of the Companys commercial markets and reflects its objective to leverage its Mexican operations in connection with its growth strategy in Latin and South America.  

 The Company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas important to its consumers. Brand awareness is amplified through immersive traditional play, digital applications, publishing and lifestyle licensing experiences presented for the consumers enjoyment. The Companys focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet. The Companys core brands represent Company-owned or Company-controlled brands, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE, NERF and TONKA, which have been successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth. During 2008 the Company had strong sales of core brand products, namely LITTLEST PET SHOP, TRANSFORMERS, PLAYSKOOL, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS and PLAY-DOH. This strategy of reimagining, reinventing and reigniting its brands has proved instrumental to achieving its overall growth objectives.  

 21   
 The Company also seeks to drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment. As an example of this, in July of 2007, the TRANSFORMERS motion picture was released and the Company developed and marketed products based on the motion picture. As a result of pairing this core brand with this type of entertainment, both the movie and the product line benefited. The Company expects to continue this strategy and anticipates the theatrical releases of both TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN and G.I. JOE: RISE OF COBRA motion pictures during 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into a six-year strategic relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least four motion pictures based on certain of Hasbros core brands. The first movie is expected to be released in 2010 or 2011, followed by anticipated releases of at least one movie per year thereafter.  

 While the Company believes it has achieved a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths. In 2008 and 2007, the Company had significant sales of products related to the Companys license with Marvel Characters B.V. (Marvel), primarily due to the theatrical releases of IRON MAN in May 2008, THE INCREDIBLE HULK in June 2008 and SPIDERMAN-3 in May 2007. In addition, the Company had significant sales in 2008 of products related to the movie release of STAR WARS: CLONE WARS in August 2008 as well as sales from the movie release of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL in May 2008. During 2009 the Company expects to continue to have a high level of revenues from entertainment-based licensed properties based on the expected major motion picture release of X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE as well as products related to television programming based on SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS.  

 While gross profits of theatrical entertainment-based products are generally higher than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products including our owned or controlled brands based on a movie release also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilms STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on property right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties, further impacting profits earned on these products.  

 The Companys long-term strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world. As part of this strategy, the Company entered into a multi-year strategic agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA). The agreement gives EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject to existing limitations on the Companys rights and certain other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on a broad spectrum of the Companys intellectual properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA, G.I. JOE and LITTLEST PET SHOP. The first major game releases under this agreement were released in 2008, with a full line expected in 2009.  

 While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth of its business, it also continues to be focused on reducing fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over the last 6 years the Company has improved its full year operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 12.3% in 2008. The Company reviews it operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce its cost structure and promote efficiency. The Company is also investing to grow its business in emerging markets. In 2008, the Company expanded its operations in China, Brazil, Russia, Korea and the Czech Republic. In addition, the Company is seeking to grow its business in entertainment, digital gaming, and will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business. For example, in January of 2008, the Company acquired Cranium, Inc., a developer and marketer of CRANIUM branded games and related products. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company acquired the rights to TRIVIAL PURSUIT, a brand which the Company had previously licensed on a long-term basis. Ownership of the rights will allow the Company to further leverage the brand in different media.  

 In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, over the last four years, the Companys Board of Directors  

 22   
 (the Board) has adopted four share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,700,000. After fully exhausting the prior three authorizations, the fourth authorization was approved on February 7, 2008 for $500,000. For the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company spent $357,589, $587,004 and $456,744, respectively, to repurchase 11,736, 20,795 and 22,767 shares, respectively, in the open market. Also in 2007, the Company paid $200,000 in cash to repurchase exercisable warrants for 15,750 shares of the Companys common stock. The Company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions. At December 28, 2008, the Company had $252,364 remaining under the February 2008 authorization.  

 After a very strong first nine months of 2008, the Company was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 2008 by both the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies as well as the broad based economic downturn that was experienced in most of the markets in which it operates. The Company worked with its retail customers to put certain promotional programs in place with the goal of both driving sales as well as managing inventory at retail given the weakening demand. Despite the impact of the economic conditions, the Company grew revenue in both the fourth quarter and for the full year absent the impact of foreign exchange rate changes in 2008.  

 Recent issues in the credit markets have not materially impacted the Companys liquidity. As of December 28, 2008 the Company had $630,390 in cash and had available capacity, if needed, under its revolving credit agreement. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2009.  

 Summary   

 The components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, are illustrated below for each of the three fiscal years ended December 28, 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Results of Operations  

 The fiscal years ended December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 were fifty-two week periods while the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three week period.  

 23   
 Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008 were $306,766, or $2.00 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2007 and 2006 of $333,003 and $230,055, or $1.97 and $1.29 per diluted share, respectively.  

 Net earnings includes non-operating expense related to the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability of $44,370 in 2007 and $31,770 in 2006. These warrants were repurchased during May 2007. Net earnings for 2007 also includes a favorable tax adjustment of $29,619, or $0.17 per diluted share, related to the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits.  

 In January 2008 the Company acquired Cranium, Inc. (Cranium). The results of operations for 2008 include the operations of Cranium from the acquisition closing date of January 25, 2008.  

 Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2008 were $4,021,520 compared to $3,837,557 in 2007 and $3,151,481 in 2006. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its two principal segments: the U.S. and Canada segment and the International segment, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2008 were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $10,300 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007 while consolidated net revenues in 2007 were positively impacted by foreign currency translation in the amount of $94,500 as a result of the overall weaker U.S. dollar in that year.  

 The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys two principal segments for 2008, 2007 and 2006. Results for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the Companys 2008 operating segment structure.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 U.S. and Canada  

 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2008 increased 5% to $2,406,745 from $2,293,742 in 2007. The impact of foreign currency translation on U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008 was unfavorable and decreased net revenues by approximately $3,100. The increase in net revenues in 2008 was primarily due to higher revenues in the boys toys category, driven by increased sales of STAR WARS products and sales of INDIANA JONES products. Although revenues from TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL products decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of the significant sales recognized in the prior year due to the theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007 and SPIDER-MAN 3 in May 2007, these lines remained significant contributors to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. The increase in segment net revenues for 2008 was also due to increased revenues in the games and puzzles category as a result of increased sales of DUEL MASTERS and TRIVIAL PURSUIT games and the impact of the acquisition of Cranium, partially offset by decreased revenues from plug and play games. Revenues from the tweens category also increased as a result of higher sales of NERF products, partially offset by decreased sales of POWER TOUR GUITAR, which is no longer in the Companys product line, as well as lower sales of I-DOG. Revenues from the preschool category increased slightly as higher sales of PLAYSKOOL products were partially offset by decreased sales of TONKA products. Revenues from the girls toys category increased slightly primarily as a result of of the reintroduction of EASY-BAKE oven, partly offset by decreased revenues from MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS, and LITTLEST PET SHOP. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP decreased slightly in 2008, sales of these products remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. Revenues in 2008 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES.  

 24   
 U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $283,152 in 2008 from $287,800 in 2007. Operating profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by approximately $1,100 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. U.S. and Canada segment gross profits increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2008 primarily as a result of the increased promotional programs implemented by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2008, including the provision of sales allowances and markdowns, to address the weak retail environment. The increase in gross profit in dollars was more than offset by increased product development and sales and marketing expenses related to investments the Company is making in both core brands and its digital initiative related to its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary; increased amortization as a result of the acquisition of Cranium and the purchase of intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT; increased royalty expense; and increased shipping and distribution costs, reflecting higher sales volume and higher transportation costs.  

 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2007 increased 15% to $2,293,742 from $1,997,141 in 2006. The impact of foreign currency translation on U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2007 was favorable, due to the strength of the Canadian dollar, and increased net revenues by approximately $4,500. The increase was due primarily to increased revenues in the boys toys category driven by sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products due to the theatrical releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. Although STAR WARS product sales declined in 2007 from 2006, sales of these products were a significant contributor to boys toys revenues in 2007. Revenues in the girls toys category increased as a result of higher sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products as well as higher revenues from the BABY ALIVE line which was reintroduced in the second quarter of 2006. To a lesser extent, revenues in the girls toys category were positively impacted by increased shipments of MY LITTLE PONY products. Girls toys revenues were negatively impacted by decreased sales of EASY-BAKE oven products due to the recall of the product in July of 2007. Revenues from the preschool category decreased slightly in 2007. Revenue from games and puzzles decreased slightly due to lower revenues from trading card and plug and play games partially offset by increased sales of traditional board games. Revenues from the tweens category decreased as a result of lower sales of electronic products such as VIDEONOW, ZOOMBOX and I-DOG partially offset by increased sales of NERF products. Revenues in 2007 were also positively impacted by increased sales of TOOTH TUNES.  

 U.S. and Canada operating profit increased to $287,800 in 2007 from $254,502 in 2006. Operating profit in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately $1,300 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating profit was primarily the result of higher gross profits resulting from the higher revenues discussed above. Although U.S. and Canada gross profit increased as a result of higher revenues, this increase in gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 of charges recorded in the second quarter of 2007 related to the July 2007 EASY-BAKE oven recall. The increase in gross profit was also partially offset by higher royalty expense as the result of the increased sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products. Operating profit was also negatively impacted by higher advertising expense as well as higher selling and distribution costs related to the increased sales volume. In addition, U.S. and Canada operating profit included increased investment spending in an online initiative of the Companys Wizards of the Coast operation.  

 International  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2008 increased by 4% to $1,499,334 from $1,444,863 in 2007. In 2008 net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $7,400 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar. The increase in net revenues was primarily the result of increased product sales in the girls toys and preschool categories primarily relating to LITTLEST PET SHOP in the girls toys category and PLAYSKOOL, which includes IN THE NIGHT GARDEN products, in the preschool category. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING product, TRIVIAL PURSUIT products and MONOPOLY products. Net revenues in the boys toys category decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products, however, both product lines continued to be significant contributors to International segment net revenues in 2008. Decreased net revenues in the boys toys category were  

 25   
 partially offset by increased sales of STAR WARS and sales of INDIANA JONES products. Net revenues in the tweens category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues from POWER TOUR GUITAR, which is no longer in the Companys product line, and I-DOG, partially offset by increased sales of NERF products.  

 International segment operating profit decreased 13% to $165,186 in 2008 from $189,783 in 2007. Operating profit for the International segment in 2008 was negatively impacted by approximately $4,400 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in International segment operating profit also reflects promotional programs implemented by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2008 in response to weakened retail conditions; increased advertising expense; and increased investments in emerging markets; partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result of lower sales of entertainment-based products. In addition, International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom.  

 International segment net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2007 increased by 32% to $1,444,863 from $1,092,468 in 2006. In 2007, net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $88,800 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. The increase in net revenues was primarily the result of increased net revenues in the boys toys category. As in the U.S. and Canada segment, this increase was driven by higher sales of TRANSFORMERS products resulting from the theatrical release of the TRANSFORMERS movie in most countries in July of 2007 and MARVEL products resulting from the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007. Increased revenues in the girls toys category were principally the result of increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products, and to a lesser extent, MY LITTLE PONY and BABY ALIVE products. Revenues in the preschool category were higher in 2007 based on increased sales of PLAYSKOOL products, partially due to strong revenues of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN in the United Kingdom. Revenues in the games and puzzles category increased primarily due to increased sales of MONOPOLY. Revenues from the tweens category increased primarily as a result of sales of the POWER TOUR GUITAR which was introduced in 2007.  

 International segment operating profit increased 69% to $189,783 in 2007 from $112,350 in 2006. Operating profit for the segment in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately $10,600 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The remaining increase in operating profit was due to the higher revenues discussed above. The increased gross profit as a result of the higher revenues was partially offset by higher royalty expense due to higher sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products as well as higher advertising and selling, distribution and administration expenses.  

 Gross Profit  

 The Companys gross profit margin decreased to 57.9% for the year ended December 28, 2008 from 58.9% in 2007. The decrease is primarily due to incremental promotional programs, including sales allowances and markdowns, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weak retail environment, as well as changes in product mix. Decreases in gross profit as the result of input cost inflation were partially offset by cost savings initiatives and an increase in pricing of certain of the Companys products. The Company currently does not expect to have similar incremental promotional programs in 2009.  

 The Companys gross profit margin increased to 58.9% for the year ended December 30, 2007 from 58.6% in 2006. This increase was due to changes in product mix, primarily the positive impact of higher sales of licensed products. Although licensed products generally carry a higher gross margin, the increased gross margin was largely offset by higher royalty expense associated with these products. Gross profit in 2007 was also negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 in charges related to the recall of the Companys EASY-BAKE oven product and by a charge of approximately $10,000 related to a restructuring and related reduction in work force at the Companys manufacturing facility in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. This charge consisted primarily of severance costs.  

 26   
 Expenses  

 The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 28, 2008:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Amortization expense increased to $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues in 2008 compared to $67,716 or 1.8% of net revenues in 2007. The increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of Cranium, Inc. in January 2008 and the purchase of the intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT in the second quarter of 2008. Property rights of $68,500 and $80,800 were recorded as a result of the Cranium, Inc. acquisition and the purchase of TRIVIAL PURSUIT, respectively, and are each being amortized over fifteen years. Amortization expense decreased to $67,716 in 2007 from $78,934 in 2006. A portion of amortization expense relates to licensing rights and is based on expected sales of products related to those licensing rights. The decrease in amortization expense in 2007 primarily related to decreased amortization of the product rights related to STAR WARS.  

 Royalty expense decreased to $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in 2008 compared to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in 2007. The decrease in royalty expense is primarily the result of the impact of foreign exchange. Absent this foreign exchange impact, royalty expense decreased slightly as the result of slightly lower sales of entertainment-based products. Royalty expense increased to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in 2007 compared to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products, primarily MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products due to the theatrical releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS in 2007.  

 Research and product development expense increased in 2008 to $191,424 or 4.8% of net revenues from $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues in 2007. The increase in 2008 reflects higher investments in the Companys core brands, increased expenditures relating to the Companys digital initiatives, as well as additional expenses as a result of the Companys Cranium acquisition. Research and product development expense decreased in 2007 to $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues from $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This decrease reflected higher investments in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased expenditures related to the introduction of the MARVEL product lines in late 2006 and early 2007.  

 Advertising expense increased in dollars to $454,612 in 2008 from $434,742 in 2007, but remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 11.3%. The increase in dollars is primarily the result of higher spending to increase awareness of the Companys brands. Advertising expense increased in dollars to $434,742 in 2007 from $368,996 in 2006, but decreased as a percentage of revenues to 11.3% from 11.7% in 2006. The decrease as a percentage of revenues primarily related to the mix of sales in 2007, which included increased sales of entertainment-based products, which require lower amounts of advertising and promotion. Revenues from properties related to major motion picture releases were higher in 2008 and 2007 as compared to 2006.  

 Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008, compared to $755,127 or 19.7% of net revenues in 2007. The increase reflects increased sales and marketing expenses to support the growth in the business; increased investment in the expansion into emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Russia, the Czech Republic and Korea; increased investment in the Companys digital and entertainment strategies; and increased shipping and distribution costs associated with both increased sales volume and higher transportation costs. Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars to $755,127 in 2007 from $682,214 in 2006 but decreased as a percentage of revenues to 19.7% from 21.7% in 2006. The increase in dollars reflected higher variable selling and distribution costs resulting from higher revenues in 2007, as well as higher incentive compensation provisions, the impact of foreign currency, and  

 27   
 general inflationary increases. The decrease as a percentage of revenues in 2008 and 2007 compared to 2006 reflects the fixed nature of certain of these expenses, coupled with the higher revenues in each of those years.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense increased to $47,143 in 2008 from $34,618 in 2007. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher average borrowings in 2008 primarily as a result of the issuance of $350,000 of notes in September 2007, partially offset by the repayment of $135,092 of notes in July 2008. The increase in the average borrowing rate for 2008 from the issuance of long-term debt in 2007 was more than offset by decreases in the average borrowing rate on short-term debt in 2008 as well as the repayment of 6.15% notes in July 2008.  

 Interest expense increased to $34,618 in 2007 from $27,521 in 2006. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average borrowings in 2007 primarily resulting from the issuance of $350,000 of notes in September 2007. The majority of the proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay short-term debt resulting from increased repurchases of common stock as well as the repurchase of the Lucas warrants for $200,000.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income was $17,654 in 2008 compared to $29,973 in 2007 and $27,609 in 2006. The decrease in interest income in 2008 from 2007 is primarily the result of lower returns on invested cash. Interest income in 2006 includes $5,200 related to a long-term deposit that was refunded during 2006. The increase in interest income in 2007 from 2006 primarily reflected higher average rates of return in 2007 compared to 2006, and, to a lesser extent, higher average invested balances in 2007. During a portion of 2007 and 2006, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate securities, which generated a higher rate of return and contributed to the higher level of interest income in 2007 and 2006.  

 Other (Income) Expense, Net  

 Other (income) expense, net of $23,752 in 2008 compares to $52,323 in 2007 and $34,977 in 2006. In 2007 and 2006 the major component of other (income) expense was non-cash expense related to the change in fair value of the Lucas warrants, which were required to be classified as a liability. These warrants were required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. In May 2007, the Company exercised the call option on these warrants and repurchased them for $200,000 in cash, which approximated fair value at that date. As these warrants were repurchased in 2007, there was no fair value adjustment in 2008. For 2007 and 2006, expense related to the change in fair value of these warrants was $44,370 and $31,770, respectively. Absent the impact of the fair value adjustments, increased expense in 2008 primarily relates to increased foreign exchange losses arising from the impact of the large downward movement in foreign exchange rates, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008, on non-U.S. denominated intercompany balances.  

 Income Taxes  

 Income tax expense totaled 30.4% of pretax earnings in 2008 compared with 28.0% in 2007 and 32.6% in 2006. Income tax expense for 2008 is net of a tax benefit of approximately $10,200 related to discrete tax events, primarily comprised of a benefit from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings, as well as the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2007 was net of a benefit of $29,999 related to discrete tax events, primarily relating to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Income tax expense for 2006 includes a charge of approximately $7,800 related to discrete tax events, primarily relating to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Absent these items, potential interest and penalties recorded in 2008 and 2007 related to uncertain tax positions, and the effect of the fair value adjustment of the Lucas warrants, which had no tax effect in 2007 and 2006, the 2008 effective tax rate would have been 32.8% compared to 30.5% in 2007 and 27.6% in 2006. The increase in the adjusted rate to 32.8% in 2008 compared to 30.5% in 2007 primarily reflects the change in the mix of where the Company earned its profits. The increase in the adjusted rate to 30.5% in 2007 from  

 28   
 27.6% in 2006 primarily reflects the decision to provide for the repatriation of a portion of 2007 international earnings to the U.S.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2008, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program. During 2009, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2009, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us.  

 At December 28, 2008, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings were $622,804 compared to $764,257 and $704,818 at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Hasbro generated $593,185, $601,794, and $320,647 of cash from its operating activities in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006 operating cash flows were impacted by royalty advances paid of $70,000 and $105,000 related to MARVEL in those respective years. In addition, 2007 and 2006 net earnings included non-cash expense of $44,370 and $31,770, respectively, related to the fair value adjustment related to the Lucas warrants that were repurchased in May of 2007. The remaining decrease in 2008 operating cash flows was due to decreased net earnings in 2008 compared to 2007. The higher cash flows from operations in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily the result of increased earnings as well as the mix of products in 2007 net revenues.  

 Accounts receivable decreased to $611,766 at December 28, 2008 from $654,789 at December 30, 2007. The accounts receivable balance at December 28, 2008 includes a decrease of approximately $61,100 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts receivable increased slightly. Accounts receivable increased to $654,789 at December 30, 2007 from $556,287 at December 31, 2006. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher sales volume in 2007. The December 30, 2007 accounts receivable balance includes an increase of approximately $31,100 related to the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding remained consistent at 45 days in 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Company has a revolving accounts receivable securitization facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided fractional ownership interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, there was $250,000 sold at each period-end under this program.  

 Inventories increased to $300,463 at December 28, 2008 from $259,081 at December 30, 2007. The increase relates to lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weak retail environment and, to a lesser extent, the Companys expansion into emerging markets. The December 28, 2008 inventory balance includes a decrease of approximately $20,900 as a result of the currency impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008. The increase in inventory to $259,081 at December 30, 2007 from $203,337 at December 31, 2006 reflected the growth of the Companys business in 2007. In addition, inventories increased approximately $9,400 due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2007.  

 Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $171,387 at December 28, 2008 from $199,912 at December 30, 2007. This decrease is primarily due to utilization of a portion of the Marvel and the remainder of the Lucas prepaid royalty advances. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made. At  

 29   
 December 28, 2008, the Company had prepaid royalties related to the Marvel license in both current and non-current assets. Each reporting period, the Company reflects as current prepaid expense the amount of royalties it expects to reflect in the statement of operations in the upcoming twelve months. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2008 was partially offset by an increase in the value of the Companys foreign currency contracts as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $199,912 at December 30, 2007 from $243,291 at December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily due to utilization of Marvel and Lucas royalty advances, as well as a decrease in deferred tax assets.  

 Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $792,306 at December 28, 2008 from $742,122 at December 30, 2007. The increase was primarily the result of increased accrued royalties as a result of the utilization of the remainder of the Lucas prepaid royalty advance in the third quarter of 2008 as well as increased accrued pension primarily due to decreases in the Plans asset values in 2008. The December 28, 2008 accounts payable and accrued expenses balance includes a decrease of approximately $64,300 as a result of the currency impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 compared to 2007. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $742,122 at December 30, 2007 from $895,311 at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the Companys exercise of its call option related to warrants required to be classified as a liability and repurchasing these warrants for $200,000 in cash in the second quarter of 2007. At December 31, 2006, these warrants had a fair value of $155,630. The decrease was also a result of the reclassification to non-current liabilities of the liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes at the beginning of 2007. These decreases were partially offset by increases in accrued royalties primarily due to the significant sales of TRANSFORMERS movie-related products, accrued advertising due to higher levels of advertising expense in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as higher accounts payable due to higher levels of inventory and expenses as of December 30, 2007.  

 Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $271,920, $112,465 and $83,604 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 utilization includes the Companys purchase of the intellectual property rights related to the TRIVIAL PURSUIT brand for a total cost of $80,800 as well as $65,153 in cash, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Cranium, Inc. in January 2008. In July 2007, with the exception of rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, the Company reacquired the remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). The acquisition price of $19,000 included $18,000 in cash and $1,000 of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of preferred stock held by the Company in a subsidiary of Infogrames. The rights repurchased in 2007 were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis as a result of a licensing agreement entered into during 2000. The Company made no acquisitions in 2006. During 2008, the Company expended approximately $117,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment compared to $92,000 during 2007 and $82,000 during 2006. Of these amounts, 56% in 2008, 61% in 2007 and 63% in 2006 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2009, the Company expects capital expenditures to decrease and be in the range of $90,000 to $100,000. During the three years ended December 28, 2008, depreciation of plant and equipment was $87,873, $88,804, and $67,773, respectively.  

 The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable made it necessary for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization program to fund its operations.  

 The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial  

 30   
 reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. During the period from the first day of the October fiscal month through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this limit is increased to $300,000. The program provides the Company with a source of working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 28, 2008, the Company had availability under this program to sell $251,100, of which $250,000 was utilized.  

 The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides it with a $300,000 committed borrowing facility. The Company has the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of at least $50,000, subject to lender agreement, up to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 28, 2008. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of December 28, 2008 were approximately $1,700. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 28, 2008 were approximately $298,300. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $38,700 was utilized at December 28, 2008. Of the amount utilized under the uncommitted lines, approximately $7,500 and $31,200 represent outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $457,391 in 2008. Of this amount, $360,244, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. In February 2008 the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500,000 in common stock after three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006 and August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,200,000 were fully utilized. During 2008, the Company repurchased 11,736 shares at an average price per share of $30.44. At December 28, 2008, $252,364 remained under the February 2008 authorization. Dividends paid were $107,065 in 2008 compared to $94,097 in 2007, reflecting the increase in the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.20 per share in 2008 from $0.16 per share in 2007, and net of the effect of decreased shares outstanding in 2008 as a result of the share repurchases. In addition, $135,092 was used to repay long-term debt. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of $120,895 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $433,917 in 2007. Of this amount, $584,349, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2007, the Company repurchased 20,795 shares at an average price per share of $28.20. In addition, the Company purchased certain warrants in May 2007 for $200,000 in accordance with the terms of the call provision of the amended Lucas warrant agreement. Dividends paid were $94,097 in 2007, compared to $75,282 in 2006, reflecting the increase in the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.16 per share in 2007 compared to $0.12 per share in 2006. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds of $346,009 from the issuance of $350,000 of notes that are due in 2017. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to repay short-term borrowings. The uses of cash were also partially offset by cash receipts of $82,661 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $467,279 in 2006. Of this amount, $456,744, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. During 2006, the Company repurchased 22,767 shares at an average price per share of $20.03. In addition, $32,743 was used to repay long-term debt. Dividends paid were $75,282 in 2006. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of $86,257 from the exercise of employee stock options.  

 At December 28, 2008, the Company has outstanding $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, should the price of the Companys common stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument that is recorded on the balance sheet at  

 31   
 its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. At December 31, 2007 and each of the calendar quarters in 2008 this conversion feature was met and the debentures were convertible throughout 2008. There were no debentures converted during 2008. At December 31, 2008, this conversion feature was met again and the bonds are convertible through March 31, 2009 at which time the requirements of the conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition, if the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day period, the Company has the right to call the debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms described above. At certain times during the year, based on the Companys common stock price, the Company had the right to call the debentures under this provision. As of December 28, 2008, the Company did not have the right to call the debentures. The Company believes a call would result in conversion by the holders of the debentures and issuance of the shares, thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding. Thus far, based on the Companys targeted capital structure and the low cost of the debentures, when the debentures have been callable the Company has believed that it was more economically beneficial for it to not exercise its right to call the debentures. Currently, this economic benefit includes a lower cash cost of paying interest on the debentures than the Company would pay in dividends on the incremental number of shares that would be outstanding. The Company will continue to assess, at times when it is available, the desirability of exercising the call option in the future based on the then existing economic circumstances and the Companys business objectives. The holders of these debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. While the Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash.  

 The $350,000 notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the Companys credit ratings on the date of issuance of the notes. From the date of issuance through December 28, 2008, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were BBB, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase. The Company currently has an open authorization from its Board of Directors to issue up to an additional $425,000 of long-term debt.  

 Including the debentures and notes described above, the Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 28, 2008 of approximately $709,723 due at varying times from 2017 through 2028. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $16,041 in 2009. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately $100,700 and purchase commitments of $227,673 outstanding at December 28, 2008. The Company believes that cash from operations, including the securitization facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations described above.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates   

 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and  

 32   
 evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations, stock-based compensation and income taxes.  

 Sales Allowances  

 Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.  

 For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2008, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates made in prior years.  

 Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

 The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and no impairment was indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 28, 2008, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $550,235 recorded on the balance sheet.  

 Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or  

 33   
 decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $492,674 at December 28, 2008. During 2008, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.  

 Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

 The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 28, 2008, the Company had $70,982 of prepaid royalties, $44,329 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $26,653 which are included in other assets.  

 Pension Costs and Obligations  

 The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze.  

 The estimates for the Companys U.S. plans are established at the Companys measurement date. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, (SFAS No. 158), the Company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.  

 The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets used in the calculation of 2008 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 8.75%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2008 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $685.  

 Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Companys discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2008 pension expense averaged 6.34%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2008 pension expense and the 2008 projected benefit obligation by approximately $165 and $7,972, respectively.  

 In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 28, 2008, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $87,906 included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $19,158 at December 30, 2007. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in the fair value of plan assets in 2008. Pension  

 34   
 plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses.  

 Stock-Based Compensation  

 The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees and non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors. Under this plan, the Company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock, as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards. The Company measures all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was $35,221, $29,402 and $22,832, respectively. As of December 28, 2008, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost was approximately $33,700.  

 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans. The Black-Scholes method includes four significant assumptions: (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk-free interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and (4) expected stock price volatility. For the Companys 2008, 2007 and 2006 stock option grants, the weighted average expected term was approximately 5 years. This amount is based on a review of employees exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option. The weighted average risk-free interest rates used for 2008, 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 2.71%, 4.79% and 4.98%, respectively. This estimate was based on the interest rate available on U.S. treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option. The weighted average expected dividend yields used for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 2.95%, 1.97% and 2.55%, respectively, which is based on the Companys current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant. The weighted average expected stock price volatilities used were 22% for 2008 and 2007 stock option grants and 24% for 2006 stock option grants. These amounts were derived using a combination of current and historical implied price volatility. Implied price volatility reflects the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the Companys common stock, which the Company believes represents the expected future volatility of the Companys stock price. The Company believes that since this is a market-based estimate, it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility.  

 In 2008, 2007 and 2006, as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock performance awards, which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the Companys common stock based on the Companys achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended December 2010 for the 2008 award, over the three fiscal years ended December 2009 for the 2007 award, and over a ten quarter period beginning July 3, 2006 and ending December 2008 for the 2006 award. Each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets. These awards are valued based on the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant and expensed over the performance period. The measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the Companys current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period. Changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards.  

 Income Taxes  

 The Companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

 35   
 An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the Companys quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2008 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2008, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately $10,200 related to discrete tax events primarily comprised of a benefit related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to the U.S., as well as the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions.  

 In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized in the Companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Companys income tax return. During 2007, the Mexican government instituted a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized. During 2008 the Company was subject to the income-based tax. As the Company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based tax in 2009, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.  

 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

 In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $709,723 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 28, 2008. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 28, 2008 are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company has a liability at December 28, 2008, including potential interest and penalties, of $92,812 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know  

 36   
 the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.  

 Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,828 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 28, 2008, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31, 2009, at which time the requirements of the contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated. If the closing price of the Companys common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at the initial conversion price of $21.60.  

 The Companys agreement with Marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. The future minimum contractual payments in the table above include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of $35,000 payable to Marvel that are contingent upon the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 4 which the Company currently expects to be paid in 2011. Subsequent to December 28, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Marvel that resulted in the extension of the current agreement from the end of 2011 through the end of 2017. The extended agreement includes an additional $100,000 in minimum guaranteed royalties, with the potential for up to an additional $140,000 in guaranteed royalties contingent upon the release by Marvel of certain MARVEL character-based theatrical releases that meet certain defined criteria. Amounts that are or may be payable to Marvel under this extended agreement are not reflected in the table above.  

 In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $17,100 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International pension plans in 2009. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $100,700 at December 28, 2008.  

 Financial Risk Management  

 The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.  

 To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $64,500 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions.  

 The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign revenues and costs. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.  

 The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 28, 2008, these contracts had unrealized gains of $72,053, of which $32,203 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $39,850 are recorded in other assets. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 28, 2008 are deferred gains of $63,513, net of tax.  

 37   
 At December 28, 2008, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt of $709,723. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately $34,300 or $30,900, respectively.  

 The Economy and Inflation   

 The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 52% of its consolidated net revenues in 2008 and 2007 and 53% of its consolidated net revenues in 2006. In the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

 The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2008, approximately 63% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration may be less in years where the Company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year. In 2008 the Company had products related to the mid-year major motion picture releases of IRONMAN, THE INCREDIBLE HULK and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas.  

 Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.  

 The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2008 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

 New Accounting Pronouncements  

 Effective at the beginning of 2009, the Company is required to prospectively adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R), which makes certain modifications to the accounting for business combinations. These changes include (1) the requirement for an acquirer to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date; (2) the requirement for an acquirer to recognize assets or liabilities arising from contingencies at fair value as of that acquisition date; and (3) the requirement that an acquirer expense all acquisition related costs. This Statement is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal 2009.  

 Effective at the beginning of 2009, the Company is required to prospectively adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (SFAS 160) which requires noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries to be initially measured at fair value and presented as a separate component of shareholders equity. Current practice is to present noncontrolling interests as a liability or other item outside of equity. The presentation and disclosure provisions of SFAS 160 are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have an impact on its consolidated balance sheet or results of operations.  

 38   
 In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, and the disclosure requirements will be applicable for the Companys 2009 consolidated financial statements.  

 In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, (FSP 132(R)-1). FSP 132(R)-1 provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The disclosures required by FSP 132(R)-1 will be applicable for the Companys year-end 2009 financial statements.  

 In 2009 the Company will adopt the remaining provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157) for non-financial assets. The adoption of these provisions will not have an impact on the Companys statements of operations or statement of financial position.  

 Other Information  

 The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
