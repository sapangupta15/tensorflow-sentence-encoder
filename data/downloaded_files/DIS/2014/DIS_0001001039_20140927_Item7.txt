CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS

2014 vs. 2013 

Revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 8%, or $3.8 billion, to $48.8 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 22%, or $1.4 billion, to $7.5 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) for the year increased 26% or $0.88 to $4.26. The EPS increase in fiscal 2014 reflected improved operating performance, a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and higher investment gains.

Revenues

Service revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 8%, or $3.0 billion, to $40.2 billion driven by the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Frozen, higher MVPD fees (Affiliate Fees) at ESPN, Broadcasting and the domestic Disney Channels, increased average guest spending for admissions and occupancy at our domestic parks and resorts operations, higher advertising revenues at ESPN and an increase in merchandise licensing revenue driven by Frozen and Disney Channel properties.

Product revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 10%, or $0.8 billion, to $8.6 billion reflecting higher worldwide home entertainment revenues driven by Frozen, increased guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise and higher volumes at our domestic parks and resorts operations and growth at our console games business driven by the success of Disney Infinity.

Costs and expenses

Cost of services for fiscal 2014 increased 6%, or $1.3 billion, to $21.4 billion driven by higher programming costs at ESPN and the ABC Television Network and an increase at our domestic parks and resorts due to MyMagic+, higher volumes and labor cost inflation.

Cost of products for fiscal 2014 increased 2%, or $120 million, to $5.1 billion driven by higher home entertainment unit sales, higher costs at our console games business driven by Disney Infinity and labor and other cost inflation and higher volumes at our domestic parks and resorts operations, partially offset by lower average home entertainment per unit costs.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 2%, or $200 million, to $8.6 billion primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by more titles in wide release.

Depreciation and amortization costs increased 4%, or $96 million, to $2.3 billion driven by MyMagic+ at our domestic parks and resorts operations.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $140 million and $214 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. Charges in 2014 were primarily due to severance costs across various of our segments and radio FCC license impairments, which were determined in connection with the plan to sell Radio Disney stations. Charges in fiscal 2013 were due to severance, contract and lease termination costs and intangible and other asset impairments. Charges in each fiscal year were largely driven by organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses.

27
Other Income/(Expense), net

Other income/(expense) is as follows (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Fiscal 2014 includes income of $29 million representing a portion of a settlement of an affiliate contract dispute in the current year and fiscal 2013 includes gains on the sale of businesses.

Interest Income/(Expense), net

Interest income/(expense), net is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in interest expense was due to lower effective interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt balances.

The increase in interest and investment income was primarily due to gains on sales of investments. Interest income also benefited from income on late payments realized in connection with the settlement of an affiliate contract dispute.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Equity in the income of investees increased 24%, or $166 million, to $0.9 billion driven by the absence of a charge in the prior year for our share of expense related to an equity redemption at Hulu LLC (Hulu Equity Redemption).

Effective Income Tax Rate 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits recognized in the prior year, which included an increase in prior-year earnings from foreign operations indefinitely reinvested outside the United States that are subject to tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $3 million to $503 million driven by improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a lower noncontrolling interest impact related to ESPN. The decrease at ESPN was due to lower net income in the current year driven by after-tax gains recognized in the prior year on the sales of a joint venture interest and our ESPN UK business, partially offset by improved operating results. 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes.

28
2013 vs. 2012 

Revenues for fiscal 2013 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $45.0 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 8%, or $454 million, to $6.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) for the year increased 8% or $0.25 to $3.38. The EPS increase in fiscal 2013 reflected improved operating performance and lower net interest expense driven by lower effective interest rates.

Revenues

Service revenues for fiscal 2013 increased 8%, or $2.7 billion, to $37.3 billion driven by higher guest spending for admissions, more passenger cruise ship days, higher attendance and an increase in occupied room nights at our domestic parks and resorts operations, contractual Affiliate Fee growth at ESPN, the domestic Disney Channels and Broadcasting, the strong theatrical performance of Wreck-It Ralph and Oz the Great and Powerful and growth at our merchandise licensing business.

Product revenues of $7.8 billion for fiscal 2013 were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012, as higher volumes and higher average guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at our domestic parks and resorts operations and the success of Disney Infinity were largely offset by a decrease in home entertainment units sold.

Costs and expenses

Cost of services for fiscal 2013 increased 8%, or $1.5 billion, to $20.1 billion driven by higher programming costs at ESPN and ABC primetime, higher film cost amortization driven by more theatrical releases and an increase at domestic parks and resorts driven by new guest offerings, labor and other cost inflation and higher volumes.

Cost of products of $4.9 billion for fiscal 2013 was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 as higher costs due to volume growth and labor and other cost inflation at our domestic parks and resorts operations and the success of Disney Infinity were largely offset by lower volumes at our home entertainment business.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 5%, or $405 million, to $8.4 billion reflected higher information technology spending driven by MyMagic+ and higher marketing costs due to the fall launch of ABC programming and more theatrical titles in release.

Depreciation and amortization costs increased 10%, or $205 million, to $2.2 billion driven by new guest offerings at our domestic parks and resorts operations.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $100 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2012 primarily due to severance, lease termination costs and the write-off of an intellectual property asset. These charges were largely due to organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses.

Other Income/(Expense), net

Other income/(expense) in fiscal 2012 is as follows (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

29
Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in interest expense was due to lower effective interest rates.

The increase in interest and investment income was due to gains on sales of investments, partially offset by higher write-downs of investments.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Equity in the income of investees increased 10%, or $61 million, to $0.7 billion due to a charge for our share of expense related to the Hulu Equity Redemption.

Effective Income Tax Rate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate decreased 2.3 percentage points for the year primarily due to an increase in the amount of prior-year foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States that are subject to foreign tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate and from favorable tax adjustments related to pre-tax earnings in prior years.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $9 million to $500 million due to higher net income at ESPN. This increase was partially offset by a higher allocation of expense to the noncontrolling interest at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort due to higher recognition of royalty and management fee expense. Additionally the impact of pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort also reduced net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS — 2014 vs. 2013 

Below is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other expenses and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.

Our Media Networks segment generates revenue from Affiliate Fees charged to MVPDs and ABC affiliated stations, advertising revenues from the sale to advertisers of time in programs for commercial announcements and other revenues, which include the sale and distribution of television programming. Significant operating expenses include amortization of programming, production, participations and residuals costs, technical support costs, distribution costs and operating labor.

31
Our Parks and Resorts segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacation packages and sales and rentals of vacation club properties. Significant operating expenses include operating labor, costs of sales and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property taxes, insurance and transportation.

Our Studio Entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and television and SVOD markets (TV/SVOD), ticket sales for live stage plays, music distribution and licensing of live entertainment events. Significant operating expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Media Networks

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 6% increase in Affiliate Fee revenue was due to an increase of 8% from higher contractual rates and an increase of 1% from an increase in subscribers, partially offset by a decrease of 2% due to the sale of our ESPN UK business in the fourth quarter of the prior year and a decrease of 1% due to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. The increase in subscribers was driven by international subscriber growth and the launch of the SEC Network, partially offset by a decline in domestic subscribers.

The 1% increase in advertising revenues was due to an increase of $165 million at Cable Networks, from $3,963 million to $4,128 million, partially offset by a decrease of $57 million at Broadcasting, from $3,960 million to $3,903 million. The increase at Cable Networks was driven by a 6% increase from higher rates and a 3% increase from more units delivered, partially offset by a 4% decrease from lower ratings. The decrease in advertising revenues at Broadcasting was due to a 2% decrease from lower units delivered, a 1% decrease due to lower owned television stations revenue and a 1% decrease from lower network ratings, partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher network rates.

Other revenue increased $74 million from $2,415 million to $2,489 million driven by the inclusion of revenues from Maker Studios, Lucasfilm SVOD sales and higher international program syndication fees at ESPN. 

33
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $526 million from $9,703 million to $10,229 million. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $378 million due to contractual rate increases for sports programming rights and the airing of FIFA World Cup soccer, partially offset by a decrease as a result of the sale of our ESPN UK business and lower production costs for international X Games events that have been discontinued. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $148 million due to a contractual rate increase for Modern Family and higher program write-offs.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $125 million from $2,768 million to $2,643 million driven by lower marketing and labor costs. Marketing costs declined at the domestic Disney Channels and ESPN, partially offset by an increase at the international Disney Channels driven by a new channel in Germany that was launched in January 2014 and higher affiliate support in Latin America. Lower marketing costs at the domestic Disney Channels reflected decreased affiliate marketing support including the absence of prior-year costs to launch the Watch Disney Channel apps. The decrease at ESPN was due to the sale of the ESPN UK business. The reduction in labor costs was driven by lower pension costs.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Income from equity investees increased $114 million from $742 million to $856 million primarily due to an increase at AETN driven by higher advertising and affiliate revenues.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 7%, or $503 million, to $7,321 million due to increases at ESPN, the domestic Disney Channels, AETN, ABC Family, the owned television stations and the ABC Television Network, partially offset by a decrease at the international Disney Channels.

The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Restructuring and impairment charges and Other income/(expense), net 

The Company recorded charges of $78 million, $85 million and $14 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2014 were due to radio FCC license and investment impairments and severance. The severance charges resulted from organizational and cost structure initiatives. The charges in fiscal 2013 were primarily for severance and contract settlement costs. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily related to severance. The fiscal 2014 radio FCC license impairments were determined in connection with the plan to sell Radio Disney stations. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded a $100 million loss related to Cable Networks in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency, which was reported in "Other income/(expense), net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

34
Parks and Resorts

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 7%, or $1.0 billion, to $15.1 billion due to an increase of $935 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $77 million at our international operations.

Revenue growth of 8% at our domestic operations reflected increases of 5% from higher average guest spending and 2% from higher volumes. Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices for admissions at our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line and increased food, beverage and merchandise spending. Higher volumes were due to attendance growth and higher occupied room nights.

Revenue growth of 3% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase from higher average guest spending and a 1% increase from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 3% decrease from lower volumes. Guest spending growth was due to higher average ticket prices and higher merchandise, food and beverage spending. Lower volumes were due to decreases in attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris.

The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $139 million from $4,094 million to $4,233 million, cost of sales, which increased $77 million from $1,348 million to $1,425 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased $99 million from $1,755 million to $1,854 million. The increase in operating labor was primarily due to inflation, new guest offerings, including MyMagic+, and higher volumes, partially offset by lower pension and postretirement medical costs. The increase in 

35
cost of sales was due to higher volumes and inflation. The increase in infrastructure costs was due to the roll out of MyMagic+. In addition, other operating expenses increased driven by higher volumes.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $104 million from $1,960 million to $1,856 million due to the absence of development costs for MyMagic+, partially offset by higher marketing and sales costs and higher pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. In the current year, costs for MyMagic+ are included in operating expenses as MyMagic+ has been made available to guests. Higher marketing and sales costs were driven by marketing for new guest offerings.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to MyMagic+.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 20%, or $443 million, to $2,663 million due to growth at our domestic operations partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris.

Studio Entertainment

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the performance of Frozen in the current year. The benefit of three Marvel titles and Maleficent in the current year was essentially offset by one Marvel title, the animated titles Monsters University and Wreck-It Ralph, and Oz The Great And Powerful in the prior year.

Growth in home entertainment revenue reflected a 13% increase from higher unit sales and a 9% increase from higher average net effective pricing. Growth in unit sales was due to sales of new releases reflecting the performance of Frozen. Higher pricing was primarily due to an increase in the current year sales mix of new releases, which have a higher relative sales price compared to catalog titles. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. Other significant titles in release included Monsters University, Marvel’s Thor: The Dark World, Planes and Marvel’s Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier in the current year compared to Brave, Wreck-It Ralph, Marvel’s Iron Man 3, Oz The Great And Powerful and Marvel’s The Avengers in the prior year.

Higher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue reflected an increase of 16% from other revenues due to an increase at Lucasfilm’s special effects business driven by higher volume and inclusion of a full year of results (Lucasfilm was acquired in December 2012), higher stage play revenues due to more productions in the current year and higher music distribution revenues reflecting the success of the Frozen soundtrack.

36
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include a decrease of $4 million in film cost amortization, from $1,806 million to $1,802 million, driven by a lower average amortization rate due to the success of Frozen compared to titles in the prior year, which was essentially offset by the impact of higher revenues. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold, which increased $129 million, from $1,206 million to $1,335 million. The increase was driven by higher revenues from Lucasfilm’s special effects business, more stage play productions and increased music sales, partially offset by a decrease at home entertainment. Lower home entertainment distribution costs and cost of goods sold were primarily due to lower average per unit costs, which included the benefit of cost saving initiatives, partially offset by an increase in units sold.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $311 million from $2,145 million to $2,456 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by more titles in wide release.

The decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to lower amortization of intangible assets.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased $888 million to $1,549 million due to increases in home entertainment and theatrical distribution.

Restructuring and impairment charges and Other income/(expense), net 

The Company recorded charges of $7 million, $18 million and $18 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were primarily for severance costs from organizational and cost structure initiatives. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily due to an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded a $31 million loss related to Studio Entertainment in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency, which was reported in "Other income/(expense), net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Consumer Products

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 13% increase in licensing and publishing revenues was due to a 12% increase from our licensing business driven by performance of merchandise based on Frozen, Disney Channel, Mickey and Minnie, Planes and Spider-Man partially offset by lower earned revenue from Cars and Monsters merchandise.

The 11% increase in retail and other revenue was from our retail business, due to comparable store sales growth in our key markets, higher online sales in North America and Europe and a new wholesale distribution business in North America, which launched in the fourth quarter of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease from store closures in Europe.

37
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included an increase of $39 million in cost of goods sold, from $641 million to $680 million, due to higher sales at our retail business including the wholesale distribution business in North America. Operating expenses also include labor, distribution and occupancy costs, which increased $60 million from $810 million to $870 million. The increase was primarily due to higher third-party royalty expense at our merchandise licensing business and higher labor and distribution costs at our retail business.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $47 million from $731 million to $778 million driven by higher labor costs and higher technology development costs. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by a full period of intangible asset amortization related to Lucasfilm.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 22% to $1,356 million due to increases at our merchandise licensing and retail businesses.

Restructuring and impairment charges and Other income/(expense), net 

The Company recorded charges of $0, $49 million and $34 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were primarily due to severance costs from organizational and cost structure initiatives. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded a $16 million loss related to Consumer Products in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency, which was reported in "Other income/(expense), net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Interactive

Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Certain reclassifications have been made to the revenue amounts presented for fiscal 2013 to conform to the fiscal 2014 presentation. The principal change was to reclassify game-related revenue from our Japan mobile business from Other content to Games.

Revenues

Games revenues grew $244 million from $812 million to $1,056 million due to increases of 24% from sales of console games and 10% from social/mobile games. The increase in sales of console games was due to the success of the Disney Infinity franchise, partially offset by the performance of Epic Mickey 2 in the prior year. The current year benefited from the launch of Disney Infinity 2.0 on September 23, 2014 and higher sales of Disney Infinity 1.0, which was launched on August 18, 2013. The increase in social/mobile games revenue was driven by performance of Tsum Tsum and Frozen Free Fall, partially offset by a decrease as a result of discontinued games. 

Revenue from other content decreased $9 million from $252 million to $243 million primarily due to the expiration of a distribution contract in the current year and lower online advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our mobile phone business in Japan. The increase in revenue at our mobile phone business in Japan was due to higher handset sales. 

38
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses reflected an $86 million increase in cost of sales from $332 million to $418 million, partially offset by a $44 million decrease in product development from $326 million to $282 million. The increase in cost of sales was due to higher Disney Infinity sales volume, partially offset by fewer units sold of other titles. Lower product development costs reflected fewer titles in development and the benefit of restructuring activities. 

The decrease in depreciation and amortization was driven by lower amortization of intangible assets. 

Segment Operating Income/(Loss)

Segment operating results improved from a loss of $87 million to income of $116 million due to growth at our games business and higher licensing fees from our mobile phone business in Japan.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded charges totaling $44 million, $11 million and $21 million related to Interactive for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which were primarily severance costs for organizational and cost structure initiatives. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS – 2013 vs. 2012

Media Networks

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Affiliate Fee growth of 7% was due to an increase of 7% from higher contractual rates.

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $178 million at Cable Networks from $3,785 million to $3,963 million, and an increase of $46 million at Broadcasting from $3,914 million to $3,960 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected increases of 7% due to higher units delivered and 4% due to higher rates, partially offset by a decrease of 6% due to lower ratings. Higher advertising revenues at Broadcasting reflected increases of 5% due to higher units delivered, 4% due to higher network advertising rates and 1% due to growth in online advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 8% due to lower primetime ratings.

The increase in other revenues was due to higher program sales at Broadcasting, the inclusion of revenues from Lucasfilm and higher international program syndication fees at ESPN, partially offset by lower royalties from MVPD distribution of our programs. Higher program sales reflected increased subscription revenues from programs distributed through Hulu.com. Syndication sales were comparable to the prior year as increases driven by Scandal, Revenge, Katie and Once Upon a Time were offset by decreases from Desperate Housewives, Castle and Grey’s Anatomy.

39
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $712 million from $8,991 million to $9,703 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production costs of $468 million was primarily due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, MLB and NBA rights, production costs for new X Games events, the addition of new college football rights and more episodes of original programming at the domestic Disney Channels. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $244 million driven by a shift of primetime hours from lower cost reality and primetime news to higher cost original scripted programming.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $117 million from $2,651 million to $2,768 million driven by higher marketing costs related to the fall launch of the ABC primetime season and an increase in labor related costs.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Income from equity investees increased to $742 million in the current year from $627 million in the prior year due to an increase at AETN primarily due to higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher sales and marketing and programming costs. The increase in equity income from AETN includes the benefit from an increase in the Company’s ownership interest from 42% to 50%.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 3%, or $199 million, to $6.8 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels and increased equity income from AETN, partially offset by a decrease at Broadcasting.

The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Parks and Resorts

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 9%, or $1.2 billion, to $14.1 billion due to an increase of $1.1 billion at our domestic operations and an increase of $112 million at our international operations.

40
Revenue growth of 10% at our domestic operations reflected a 5% increase from higher average guest spending and a 4% increase from volume. Increased guest spending was due to higher average ticket prices, food, beverage and merchandise spending, and average daily hotel room rates. Higher volume was due to park attendance growth, increased passenger cruise days and higher occupied room nights at Walt Disney World Resort and, to a lesser extent, at the Disneyland Resort. Higher passenger cruise days reflected the launch of the Disney Fantasy in March 2012, while the increase in occupied room nights at Walt Disney World Resort reflected the opening of Disney’s Art of Animation Resort in May 2012. 

Revenue growth of 4% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase from higher average guest spending at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, a 1% increase from higher Tokyo Disney Resort royalty revenue and a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease from lower volume. Guest spending growth was due to higher average ticket prices, the opening of the World of Disney store in July 2012 at Disneyland Paris and higher average daily hotel room rates. Lower volume was due to a decline in attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by attendance growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.

The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.

(2) Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending are stated at prior-year foreign exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency translation. The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.31, $1.30 and $1.39 for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased by $269 million from $3,825 million to $4,094 million, cost of sales, which increased by $54 million from $1,294 million to $1,348 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased by $250 million from $1,505 million to $1,755 million.  Higher operating labor was due to new guest offerings and labor cost inflation. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volumes partially offset by a lower costs per unit mix of vacation club units, reflecting sales at the Grand Floridian, which is a higher margin property. The increase in infrastructure costs was driven by new guest offerings and the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds collected in 2012 related to the impact of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan on Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant new guest offerings that drove increased operating labor and infrastructure costs included a full year of operating the Disney Fantasy, pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort, the expansion of Disney California Adventure and a full year of Disney’s Art of Animation Resort at Walt Disney World Resort.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $111 million from $1,849 million to $1,960 million primarily due to information technology spending related to MyMagic+.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Disney California Adventure, costs associated with the refurbishment of the Disney Magic and a full year of depreciation for the Disney Fantasy.

41
Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 17%, or $318 million, to $2,220 million due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts, Disney Vacation Club and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris and higher pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort.

Studio Entertainment

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Higher theatrical distribution revenues were driven by two Disney feature animation releases in the current year, Wreck-It Ralph and Planes, compared to none in the prior year. Other significant titles in release were Marvel’s Iron Man 3, Monsters University, Oz The Great and Powerful, The Lone Ranger and Lincoln in the current year compared to Marvel’s The Avengers, Brave, John Carter and The Muppets in the prior year.

Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 19% decrease from a decline in unit sales. The decrease in unit sales was driven by the performance of Brave, Wreck-It Ralph and Marvel’s Iron Man 3 in the current year compared to Marvel’s The Avengers, Cars 2, The Lion King Diamond Release and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides in the prior year along with lower catalog sales.

The increase in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was driven by domestic SVOD sales of library titles in the current year and the inclusion of Lucasfilm’s special effects business.

Cost and Expenses

Operating expenses included an increase of $121 million in film cost amortization, from $1,685 million to $1,806 million, driven by more significant titles in theatrical release in the current year, including the two feature animation releases, and higher TV/SVOD revenues. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower home entertainment unit sales and lower film impairments. Lower film impairments reflected the write-down of The Lone Ranger in the current year compared to the write-down of John Carter and higher development costs write-offs in the prior year. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold, which decreased $17 million from $1,223 million to $1,206 million driven by a decline in home entertainment unit sales, partially offset by the inclusion of Lucasfilm’s special effects business.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $92 million from $2,053 million to $2,145 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by two Disney feature animation releases in the current year compared to none in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment marketing.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Lucasfilm.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income decreased 8% to $661 million primarily due to lower results at our home entertainment business, partially offset by an increase in TV/SVOD distribution results and lower film cost write-downs.

42
Consumer Products

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 10% increase in licensing and publishing revenues was due to increases of 8% from our licensing business and 2% from our publishing business. The increase at licensing was due to the inclusion of revenues from Lucasfilm and the performance of merchandise based on Disney Junior, Monsters University, Mickey and Minnie, Iron Man and Planes partially offset by lower earned revenue from Cars and Winnie the Pooh merchandise. Merchandise Licensing growth also benefited from higher recognition of minimum guarantees and a licensee audit settlement. The increase at publishing was due to international sales of books based on Disney Channel properties and higher revenues at our English language learning centers in China.

The 9% increase in retail and other revenue was from our retail business, due to comparable store sales growth in our key markets, a new wholesale distribution business in North America, higher online sales in North America and Europe, and the benefit of store format changes in North America and Japan. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included an increase of $48 million in cost of goods sold, from $593 million to $641 million, due to higher sales at our retail business. Operating expenses also include distribution, labor and occupancy costs, which decreased $4 million from $814 million to $810 million. The decrease was due to lower third-party royalty expense and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, partially offset by higher labor, distribution and occupancy costs at our retail business.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $45 million from $686 million to $731 million primarily due to the inclusion of Lucasfilm and higher technology development costs.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Lucasfilm.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 19% to $1,112 million due to increases at our licensing, retail and publishing businesses.

43
Interactive

Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Certain reclassifications have been made to the revenue amounts presented for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 to conform to the fiscal 2014 presentation. The principal change was to reclassify game-related revenue from our Japan mobile business from Other content to Games.

Revenues

The increase in games revenue was due to an increase of 26% from higher self-published console game revenues due to the fourth quarter release of Disney Infinity 1.0 and 7% due to the inclusion of Lucasfilm’s interactive games business. 

Other content revenue was essentially flat as an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and lower online advertising revenues were offset by higher revenues at our Japan mobile business due to a licensing agreement that started in February 2012.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included an $80 million increase in cost of sales from $252 million to $332 million and a $5 million decrease in product development costs from $331 million to $326 million. Higher cost of sales was due to the release of Disney Infinity 1.0 and the inclusion of Lucasfilm. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $20 million from $429 million to $449 million due to higher marketing costs at our console games business in connection with the release of Disney Infinity 1.0, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Segment Operating Loss

Segment operating loss decreased from $216 million to $87 million due to improved results at our console games and Japan mobile businesses.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2014 increased $80 million from fiscal 2013 due to higher incentive compensation costs and charitable contributions. 

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2013 increased $57 million from fiscal 2012 reflecting higher incentive compensation costs and charitable contributions.

44
PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-third of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $309 million, $698 million and $626 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of yield curves constructed from a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.

In fiscal 2015, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase to approximately $460 million. The increase in pension and postretirement medical costs is driven by a lower assumed discount rate and updated assumed mortality rates to reflect life expectancy improvements. The decrease in the discount rate and the update to our assumed mortality rates also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans from $1.9 billion to $3.5 billion and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $3.5 billion ($2.2 billion after tax) from $2.0 billion ($1.2 billion after tax). If our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, a significant portion of the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical costs will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 10 years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements.

During fiscal 2014, the Company contributed $275 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2015 to total approximately $350 million to $375 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2015 will be determined based on our January 1, 2015 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available in late fiscal 2015. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.

SEVEN TV INVESTMENT

On November 18, 2011, the Company acquired a 49% interest in Seven TV for $300 million. Seven TV is a broadcast television network that was converted to an advertising-supported, free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia following the acquisition. In October 2014, new regulations were adopted in Russia that prohibit more than 20% foreign ownership of media companies and could require the Company to divest a portion of its interest by January 2016. The Company is evaluating its options with respect to these regulations and, depending on the outcome, we could have an impairment of some or all of our investment. The Company’s share of the financial results of Seven TV is reported as “Equity in the income of investees” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

IMPACT OF FISCAL REPORTING CALENDAR

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. Fiscal 2015 is a fifty-three week year beginning on September 28, 2014 and ending on October 3, 2015. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014 increased 3% or $0.3 billion to $9.8 billion compared to fiscal 2013. The increase reflected higher operating cash receipts from increased revenues across all of our segments, partially offset by 

45
higher income tax payments, higher cash payments due to new contractual payment terms for sports rights payments at Media Networks, higher programming and production spending at Media Networks and Studio Entertainment and higher payments at Parks and Resorts. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was due to labor cost inflation and increased spending on new guest offerings. Operating cash flows were also impacted by the absence of the Celador litigation payment made in fiscal 2013 and lower pension contributions.

 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2013 increased 19% or $1.5 billion to $9.5 billion compared to fiscal 2012. The increase reflected higher operating cash receipts from increased revenues at Parks and Resorts, Media Networks and Consumer Products, the favorable timing of collections at Studio Entertainment, and lower pension contributions and interest payments. The decrease in interest payments was due to a significant payment of accrued interest in connection with the fiscal 2012 refinancing of Disneyland Paris’ borrowings. These cash flow increases were partially offset by higher operating cash payments at Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and Parks and Resorts and the payment related to the Celador litigation. The increase in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by higher film production spending and the timing of participation payments, while the increase in cash payments at Media Networks was due to higher television programming and production spending. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was due to higher spending on new guest offerings and labor cost inflation, partially offset by the absence of a repurchase of vacation club mortgage receivables, which occurred in fiscal 2012.

Depreciation expense is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amortization of intangible assets is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Film and Television Costs

The Company’s Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company’s broadcast, cable networks and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.

46
The Company’s film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investing Activities

Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due to higher construction spending on the Shanghai Disney Resort. The decrease in capital expenditures at Parks and Resorts in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the final progress payment for the Disney Fantasy cruise ship in fiscal 2012 and higher fiscal 2012 spending in connection with the expansion of Disney California Adventure, the construction of Disney’s Art of Animation Resort and the development of MyMagic+, partially offset by higher fiscal 2013 spending related to the construction of the Shanghai Disney Resort.

Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.

47
Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The decrease in fiscal 2013 reflected higher spending in fiscal 2012 for corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure.

The Company currently expects its fiscal 2015 capital expenditures will be approximately $1.5 billion higher than fiscal 2014 capital expenditures of $3.3 billion driven by increased investment at Shanghai Disney Resort. While we fully consolidate capital expenditures for Shanghai Disney Resort, our net contribution is only 43% of the total capital expenditures. Therefore, net of Shanghai Disney Resort partner contributions, our capital spending is expected to increase by approximately $1.1 billion.

Other Investing Activities

During fiscal 2014, acquisitions totaled $0.4 billion due to the acquisition of Maker Studios and proceeds from the sales of investments and dispositions totaled $0.4 billion.

During fiscal 2013, acquisitions totaled $2.4 billion driven by the acquisition of Lucasfilm. Proceeds from dispositions totaled $0.4 billion primarily due to the sale of our 50% equity interest in ESS.

During fiscal 2012, acquisitions totaled $1.1 billion driven by the acquisition of an incremental 43% interest in UTV and a 49% interest in Seven TV in Russia. We also made a $300 million equity contribution to AETN.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013. The net use of cash in the current year was due to $6.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $1.5 billion in dividends, partially offset by cash benefits associated with equity compensation awards of $0.7 billion, net borrowings of $0.6 billion and contributions from our Shanghai Disney Resort joint venture partner of $0.6 billion. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $2.5 billion versus the prior fiscal year was due to higher repurchases of common stock.

Cash used in financing activities was $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2012. The net use of cash in fiscal 2013 was due to repurchases of common stock of $4.1 billion and dividends of $1.3 billion, partially offset by cash benefits associated with equity compensation awards of $0.8 billion and contributions from our Shanghai Disney Resort joint venture partner of $0.5 billion. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $1.2 billion versus fiscal 2012 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock.

During the year ended September 27, 2014, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

48
The Company’s bank facilities as of September 27, 2014 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All of the above bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread depending on the credit default swap spread applicable to the Company’s debt, subject to a cap and floor that vary with the Company’s debt rating assigned by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. The spread above LIBOR can range from 0.23% to 1.63%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in March 2019, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of September 27, 2014, $223 million of letters of credit had been issued of which none were issued under this facility. 

The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.

The Company paid a $0.86 per share dividend ($1.5 billion) during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 related to fiscal 2013. The Company paid a $0.75 per share dividend ($1.3 billion) during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 related to fiscal 2012. The Company paid a $0.60 per share dividend ($1.1 billion) during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to fiscal 2011. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2014. 

During fiscal 2014, the Company repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock for $6.5 billion. During fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased 71 million shares of its common stock for $4.1 billion. During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 72 million shares of its common stock for $3.0 billion. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 77 million additional shares. 

We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors”. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company’s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 27, 2014, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard & Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 27, 2014, by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.

49
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 27, 2014 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $74 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. Amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. In 2023, the Company has the ability to call a debt instrument prior to its scheduled maturity, which if exercised by the Company would reduce future interest payments by $1.1 billion.

(2)Other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.

(3)Contractual commitments include the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of new sports and other programming commitments, primarily for incremental sports rights with payment terms that range up to 11 years, and payments subsequent to year end, the Company’s sports and other broadcast programming commitments are approximately $58 billion as of November 15, 2014.

Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees

The Company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company has recognized a $198 million liability for the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Maker Studios, Inc. The Company does not currently expect that other contractual arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Notes 3, 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.

Legal and Tax Matters

As disclosed in Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.

Disneyland Paris Refinancing

At September 27, 2014, Disneyland Paris had €1.8 billion in loans outstanding from the Company. In order to improve Disneyland Paris’ financial position, Disneyland Paris announced, with the Company’s backing, a €1.0 billion recapitalization through a rights offering to raise €0.4 billion of equity along with the conversion of €0.6 billion of loans from the Company into equity in Disneyland Paris. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Film and Television Revenues and Costs

We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.

With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.

With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the program’s rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company’s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.

We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program’s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.

Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company’s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.

Revenue Recognition

The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.

51
We reduce home entertainment and game revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.

We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. We recognize revenues from expiring multi-use tickets ratably over the estimated usage period. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a five-year time period based on estimated usage. The estimated usage periods are derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions

The Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 4.40% at the end of fiscal 2014 from 5.00% at the end of fiscal 2013 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our September 27, 2014 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense in fiscal 2015. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2015 by $203 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 27, 2014 by $2.1 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $188 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2015 annual benefit expense by $100 million.

The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.

To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.

In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.

The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.

During the current year, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $46 million related to radio FCC licenses held by businesses in the Media Networks segment. The radio FCC license impairment charges were determined in connection with the plan to sell Radio Disney stations and the fair value was derived from market transactions. During fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded impairments totaling $5 million and $0, respectively. These impairment charges were recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.

Contingencies and Litigation

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.

Income Tax Audits

As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K.
