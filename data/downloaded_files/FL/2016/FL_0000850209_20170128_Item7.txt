 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  

 ﻿  

 In the following tables, we have presented certain financial measures and ratios identified as non-GAAP such as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (“EBIT”), adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”), free cash flow, and net debt capitalization. Additionally, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Throughout the following discussions, where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.   

 ﻿  

 We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or which affect comparability. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency movements. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives.   

 ﻿  

 The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We estimate the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments by applying its marginal rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount.  

 ﻿  

 Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliations for free cash flow and net debt capitalization in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 16  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ROIC is presented below and represents a non-GAAP measure. We believe it is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. In order to calculate ROIC, we adjust our results to reflect our operating leases as if they qualified for capital lease treatment. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the presentation of these leases as if they were capital leases is appropriate. Accordingly, the asset base and net income amounts are adjusted to reflect this in the calculation of ROIC. ROIC, subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long-term incentive compensation.   

 ﻿  

 The closest U.S. GAAP measure to ROIC is Return on Assets (“ROA”) and is also represented below. ROA increased to 17.4 percent as compared to 14.7 percent in the prior year, which partially relates to the fact that the prior year results included a $61 million after-tax litigation charge. Additionally, our overall improved performance in 2016 also increased ROA. Our ROIC decreased to 15.1 percent as compared to 15.8 percent in the prior year. This reflected an increase in our average invested capital as a result of the inclusion of our new headquarters lease and the effect of opening larger stores supporting the various shop-in-shop initiatives.

 ﻿  

 Highlights of our 2016 financial performance include:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Sales and comparable-store sales, as noted in the table below, both increased and continued to benefit from exciting assortments and enhanced store formats across our various banners, as well as improved performance of our store banner.com websites.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   ·    The following represents the percentage of sales from each of the major product categories: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 18  

   ·    Sales from the Direct-to-Customers segment increased 8.3 percent to $1,022 million, compared with $944 million in 2015 and increased 50 basis points as a percentage of total sales to 13.2 percent. The direct business has been steadily increasing as a percentage of total sales over the last several years, led by the continued growth in the store banners’ ecommerce sales. 

 ﻿  

   ·    Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, increased by 10 basis points to 33.9 percent in 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by an increase in our merchandise margin rate, reflecting a lower markdown rate compared to the prior year.  

   ·    SG&A expenses were 19.0 percent of sales, a decrease of 10 basis points as compared with the prior year, as we continued to diligently manage variable expenses.  

 ﻿  

   ·    EBIT margin and our adjusted EBIT margin was 13.0 percent in 2016, which surpassed our long-term financial objective, as well as the rate in the prior year. This reflected the strong earnings generated during 2016.  

 ﻿  

   ·    Net income was $664 million, or $4.91 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 27.9 percent from the prior-year period. Adjusted net income was $652 million, or $4.82 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 12.4 percent from the prior-year period.  

 ﻿  

   ·    Net income margin increased to 8.6 percent as compared with 7.3 percent in the prior year. Our adjusted net income margin improved 20 basis points to 8.4 percent in 2016 compared to the prior year, making progress towards reaching our long term objective measure of 8.5 percent.  

 ﻿  

 Highlights of our 2016 financial position:  

 ﻿  

   ·    We ended the year in a strong financial position. At year end, we had $919 million of cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Cash and cash equivalents at January 28, 2017 were $1,046 million, representing an increase of $25 million as compared with last year. This improvement reflects earnings strength and the successful execution of various key initiatives noted in the items below.  

 ﻿  

   ·    Net cash provided by operating activities was $816 million, representing a $71 million increase over last year. 

 ﻿  

   ·    Cash capital expenditures during 2016 totaled $266 million and were primarily directed to the remodeling or relocation of 218 stores, the build-out of 96 new stores, as well as other technology and infrastructure projects. 

 ﻿  

   ·    During 2016 we returned significant value to our shareholders. Dividends totaling $147 million were declared and paid during 2016, and 7.0 million shares were repurchased under our share repurchase program at a cost of $432 million. 

 ﻿  

 Summary of Consolidated Statements of Operations  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 19  

 Sales  

 ﻿  

 All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of comparable-store sales also includes the sales of the Direct-to-Customers segment. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.   

 ﻿  

 Sales of $7,766 million in 2016 increased by 4.8 percent from sales of $7,412 million in 2015, representing a comparable-store sales increase of 4.3 percent. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased 5.2 percent as compared with 2015. Sales of $7,412 million in 2015 increased by 3.6 percent from sales of $7,151 million in 2014, this represented a comparable-store sales increase of 8.5 percent. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased 8.9 percent as compared with 2014.   

 ﻿  

 Gross Margin  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The improvement in the merchandise margin rate in 2016 reflects a lower markdown rate, primarily in our Athletic Stores segment, due to an increase in full-price selling. This improvement was partially offset by increased promotional activity within our Direct-to-Customers segment. The change in the gross margin rate also reflects an increase in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate compared to 2015. This pressured our gross margin rate as certain high-profile locations were closed for remodeling for all or part of the year, which increased the occupancy expense rate since these locations were not generating sales while incurring tenancy costs.   

 ﻿  

 Gross margin in 2015 improved 60 basis points to 33.8 percent as compared with 2014. The improvement was driven by both an improved merchandise margin rate and a decrease in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate reflecting improved sales leverage. The improvement in the merchandise margin rate primarily reflected an enhanced ability to achieve full-priced selling, as fewer markdowns were needed due to the freshness of inventory.  

 ﻿  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 SG&A increased by $57 million and 4.0 percent as compared with the prior year. The effect of foreign currency fluctuations for the current year was not significant. As a percentage of sales, the SG&A rate decreased by 10 basis points as compared with 2015, which reflected diligent expense management specifically in store wages by our Athletic Stores segment and was partially offset by increased marketing costs incurred by our Direct-to-Customers segment in order to drive traffic to its websites.   

 ﻿  

 For 2015, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A increased by $72 million as compared with 2014. The increase was driven by higher variable expenses to support sales, such as store wages and banking expenses. As a percentage of sales, SG&A improved 80 basis points representing improved leverage of our fixed costs as a result of our sales increase. This improvement reflected effective expense management, specifically store wage improvements due to productivity gains reflecting the continued utilization of hiring and scheduling tools.  

 ﻿  

 20  

Depreciation and Amortization   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Depreciation and amortization increased $10 million in 2016. The effect of foreign currency fluctuations for the current year was not significant. The increases in both 2016 and 2015 reflect a rise in capital spending on store improvements, our new corporate headquarters, our digital sites and various corporate technology upgrades. In addition, the 2014 amount included $2 million of capital accrual adjustments which reduced depreciation and amortization.   

 ﻿  

 Impairment and Litigation Charges  

 ﻿  

 During 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment charges totaling $6 million ($5 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share), and $4 million ($3 million after-tax or $0.02 per diluted share), respectively, relating to the write down of store fixtures and leasehold improvements for our Runners Point and Sidestep stores. Also during 2015, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $1 million to fully write down the value of an ecommerce trade name.   

 ﻿  

 During 2015, we recorded a $100 million pension litigation charge ($61 million after-tax or $0.43 per diluted share). This charge relates to a class action in which the plaintiffs alleged that the Company failed to properly disclose the effects of the 1996 conversion of the retirement plan to a defined benefit plan with a cash balance formula. In September 2015, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and issued a decision ordering that the pension plan be reformed. We are appealing the court’s decision, and the judgment has been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. Our reasonable estimate of this liability is a range between $100 million and $200 million, with no amount within that range more probable than any other amount. Therefore, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million.   

 ﻿  

 Please see Item 8. “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 3, Impairment and Litigation Charges and Note 22, Legal Proceedings for further information.   

 ﻿  

 Interest Expense, Net  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Net interest expense decreased by $2 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, and decreased $1 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. The decrease in net interest expense for both 2016 and 2015 primarily represented increased income due to higher average interest rates on our cash investments. We did not have any short-term borrowings, other than amounts related to capital leases, for any of the periods presented.   

 ﻿  

 Income Taxes   

 ﻿  

 Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 33.9 percent, as compared with 35.4 percent in 2015. We regularly assess the adequacy of provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may be adjusted due to new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitations. The effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 includes reserve releases totaling $1 million and $4 million, respectively, due to audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations.   

 21  

 On December 7, 2016, the U.S. Treasury issued regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987 (“Section 987 Regulations”) which requires us to change our method for determining the tax effects of foreign currency translation gains and losses for our foreign businesses that are operated as branches and are reported in a currency other than the currency of their parent. This change resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our income tax provision in the amount of $9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.  

 ﻿  

 During the fourth quarter of 2016, we also recorded tax expense of $2 million ($0.02 per diluted share) due to a corporate income tax rate change in France.  

 ﻿  

 During the third quarter of 2016, we performed a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property (“IP”) provided to our European business by Foot Locker in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012. Driven by the recent success of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new, higher valuation resulted in catch-up deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.   

 ﻿  

 In 2015, we recorded a pension-related litigation charge of $100 million with a related tax benefit of $39 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. This litigation charge reduced the overall effective rate because it reduced the proportion of our worldwide income taxed in the United States, where the tax rates are the highest.  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the reserve releases in 2016 and 2015, the effects of the IP valuation catch-up deductions, the French rate change and the issuance of Section 987 Regulations in 2016, and the pension litigation charge in 2015, the effective tax rate for 2016 decreased slightly as compared with 2015, primarily due to the mix of income as well as the current year tax benefit related to the higher IP valuation.   

 ﻿  

 The effective tax rate for 2015 was 35.4 percent, as compared with 35.7 percent in 2014. Excluding the reserve releases in 2015 and 2014 and the effect of the pension litigation charge, the effective tax rate for 2015 was essentially unchanged as compared with 2014.   

 ﻿  

 Segment Information  

 ﻿  

 We have two reportable segments, Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers, which are based on our method of internal reporting. We evaluate performance based on several factors, the primary financial measure of which is division results. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, pension litigation charge, corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense.   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 2016 compared with 2015  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales from our Athletic Stores segment increased by 4.7 percent. Of the total increase, 69 percent was generated by our domestic businesses, with almost all banners contributing to the growth. Champs Sports drove the domestic performance, while internationally the increase was driven by our Foot Locker Europe operations. Partially offsetting these increases were declines from Lady Foot Locker and our Runners Point and Sidestep banners. The Lady Foot Locker sales decline primarily represented the effect of store closures. The Runners Point and Sidestep banners continued to experience sales declines during 2016 as a result of assortment and traffic challenges. We continue our focus on improving these banners by better diversifying and refining our product offerings, along with providing a more elevated in-store experience. During 2015 and currently continuing, we began broadening the assortment in the Runners Point stores beyond performance running to include more lifestyle running products, while the Sidestep stores shifted to lifestyle and casual footwear. We believe that these initiatives will position the banners for future growth.  

 ﻿  

 Comparable-store sales increased by 3.6 percent as compared with 2015. Footwear sales continue to be the primary contributor to our sales growth during 2016 and reflected strong gains across men’s, children’s, and women’s footwear categories. Our children’s footwear business had a very successful year experiencing comparable-store gains across almost all of our store banners, led by sales from Champs Sports and Kids Foot Locker. During 2016, we opened 45 new Kids Foot Locker stores, 16 of which are in Europe and Canada. The addition of these stores reflects our expectation that the momentum of our children’s business will continue. Within footwear, lifestyle running was the strongest category, while our basketball business slightly declined for the year.  

 ﻿  

 Our apparel sales also generated positive results during the current year. This category was led primarily by gains in branded and private-label apparel sales at Champs Sports. Foot Locker Europe’s apparel sales also increased during the current year and was driven by sales of men’s branded apparel.  

 ﻿  

 Division profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 20 basis points as compared with 2015. During 2016, a $6 million impairment charge was recorded to write down the value of store fixtures and leasehold improvements for 116 Runners Point and Sidestep stores. Excluding the effect of the impairment charge, division profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 30 basis points as compared with the prior year. The division profit rate improvement reflected an improved merchandise margin rate due to a lower markdown rate coupled with diligent expense management.   

 ﻿  

 2015 compared with 2014  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales from the Athletic Stores segment increased 8.6 percent. Comparable-store sales increased by 7.6 percent. Foot Locker Europe and Foot Locker Asia Pacific led the comparable-stores sales increase. Foot Locker Europe generated double digit comparable-store gains in footwear, apparel, and accessories. The increase in footwear was primarily related to sales of classic court styles, lifestyle running, and men’s basketball. Apparel sales experienced gains in both the branded and private label categories.   

 ﻿  

 The strong performance internationally was partially offset by the underperformance of the Runners Point and Sidestep stores. The sales decline at our Runners Point and Sidestep stores reflected the continued segmentation process and the overreliance on a few key running styles. Our segmentation process included better defining product offerings and executing upon our multi-banner strategy in the European market. During 2015 we began the process of shifting the assortment in the Runners Point stores beyond performance running to include more lifestyle running products, while the Sidestep stores were being shifted to lifestyle and casual footwear.   

 23  

 Domestically, sales increases were led by Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker with all formats generating a comparable-store sales increase. Running and basketball were the strongest drivers of footwear sales. The Jordan brand, as well as the rise of new marquee styles contributed to the growth in the basketball category. Children’s footwear sales also performed well across all of the divisions. Sales continue to benefit from the expansion of shop-in-shop partnerships with our key vendors. We opened more than 40 shop-in-shops during 2015, including 21 House of Hoops shops in partnership with Nike.   

 ﻿  

 While Lady Foot Locker/SIX:02’s overall sales declined slightly in 2015, the combined banners produced a mid-single digit comparable-store sales gain. The comparable-store gain was led by both footwear and apparel, partially offset by a decline in accessories. The overall sales decline reflected the closure of 42 Lady Foot Locker stores, partially offset by the opening of 15 SIX:02 stores during 2015.   

 ﻿  

 Champs Sports generated a low-single digit comparable-store sales increase driven by gains in footwear sales partially offset by declines in apparel and accessories. The decline in apparel primarily reflected the continuation of the customer’s shift away from licensed apparel.   

 ﻿  

 Division profit increased by $95 million to $872 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, which reflected higher sales and an improved gross margin rate. Variable expenses, such as store wages, were also diligently managed, resulting in an improved SG&A rate. Due to the underperformance of the Runners Point and Sidestep stores during 2015, an impairment review was performed. The review resulted in an impairment charge totaling $4 million, which was recorded to write down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements for 61 stores.   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 2016 compared with 2015  

 ﻿  

 Comparable-sales for the Direct-to-Customers segment increased 8.8 percent as compared with the prior year. Our domestic and international store-banner websites continue to represent the majority of the overall growth in sales, which was partially offset by declines in Eastbay, Runners Point and Sidestep ecommerce businesses. The overall increase in sales was led by our footwear category. Consistent with our Athletic Stores segment, footwear sales increased in men’s, women’s, and children’s. The positive sales increase in men’s footwear was primarily driven by strong gains by the Jordan brand. The increase in women’ footwear was driven by casual styles.   

 ﻿  

 Direct-to-Customers division profit, as a percent of sales, declined 100 basis points as compared with the prior year. The decline in the division profit rate reflected increased spending in marketing related costs, which was incurred in order to drive traffic to our websites. Also contributing to the decline in the division profit rate was a decline in the gross margin rate as a result of greater promotional activity by our domestic ecommerce business, especially Eastbay.   

 ﻿  

 2015 compared with 2014  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales of the Direct-to-Customers segment increased 10.6 percent as compared with 2014, while comparable sales increased by 14.4 percent. The increase was primarily a result of the continued strong sales performance of our domestic store-banner websites, as well as growth in our international ecommerce business, particularly in Europe. Of the total increase, sales from our U.S. store-banner websites comprised the majority of the increase. The growth in ecommerce reflected the continued elevation of the connection between the in-store experience and the banner websites, as well as the development of features and functionality to deliver an enhanced digital experience. These increases were partially offset by the 2014 closure of the CCS direct business. The strongest category for this segment was footwear, led by basketball and casual styles. Apparel increased slightly as compared with 2014, which primarily reflected gains in the branded apparel category.   

 24  

The Direct-to-Customers segment generated a division profit increase of $33 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, which represented a division profit margin improvement of 240 basis points. The increase was the result of strong flow-through of sales to profit, resulting from improved gross margin due to more full-price selling and effective expense management. The improvement in gross margin was due, in part, to the fact that 2014 was negatively affected by the liquidation of the CCS merchandise. Division profit in 2015 included a $1 million impairment charge to write down the value of the sp24.com ecommerce trade name, which was acquired with the Runners Point Group. sp24.com is a clearance website that has been deemphasized as we focus on full-priced selling on the websites aligned with the store banners.

 Corporate Expense   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $14 million, $11 million, and $13 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 Corporate expense decreased by $7 million in 2016 as compared with the prior year. The annual adjustment of the allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions reduced corporate expense by $9 million. This was partially offset by an increase of $3 million in depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense. During 2016, we also incurred $4 million of expenses related to our corporate headquarters relocation within New York City, as compared with $3 million during the prior year. The remaining change primarily reflected lower incentive compensation expense in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Corporate expense decreased by $4 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense decreased by $2 million. The annual adjustment of the allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions reduced corporate expense by $5 million. These decreases were offset by $3 million of costs incurred in late 2015 relating to the Spring 2016 headquarters relocation.   

 ﻿  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources   

 ﻿  

 Liquidity   

 ﻿  

 Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from earnings, while the principal uses of cash have been: to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; to finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, Internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; to make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and to fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and future cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund these requirements.  

 ﻿  

 As of January 28, 2017, we had $1,046 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $730 million was held in foreign jurisdictions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from potential future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we plan to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings. Depending on the source, amount and timing of a repatriation, and changes in tax regulations including recent proposals regarding the taxation of unremitted earnings, some future tax may be payable. We believe that our cash invested domestically and future domestic cash flows are sufficient to satisfy domestic requirements.  

 ﻿  

 The Company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.   

 ﻿  

 25  

On February 14, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new 3-year, $1.2 billion share repurchase program extending through January 2020, replacing the previous $1 billion program. Also on this date, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share to be paid on April 28, 2017, representing a 13 percent increase over the previous quarterly per share amount.  

 ﻿  

 As discussed further in the Legal Proceedings note under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” during 2015, in connection with our pension litigation, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million ($61 million after-tax). In light of the uncertainties involved in this matter, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not differ from the amount currently accrued by us. The $100 million charge has been classified as a long-term liability due to the uncertainty involved with the resolution of this litigation, as the appeals process can be lengthy. The pension plan is currently sufficiently funded to absorb a $100 million liability and, accordingly, we do not anticipate the need to make any additional pension contributions in the near term in connection with this matter. The timing and the amount of contributions to the pension plan are dependent on the funded status of the plan and various other factors, such as interest rates and the performance of the plan’s assets.  

 ﻿  

 Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, as well as other factors listed under the heading “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.   

 ﻿  

 Maintaining access to merchandise that we consider appropriate for our business may be subject to the policies and practices of our key suppliers. Therefore, we believe that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with these key suppliers. In 2016 and 2015, we purchased approximately 91 percent and 90 percent, respectively, of our merchandise from our top five suppliers and expect to continue to obtain a significant percentage of our athletic product from these suppliers in future periods. Approximately 68 percent in 2016 and 72 percent in 2015 was purchased from one supplier — Nike, Inc.  

 ﻿  

 Our 2017 planned capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs are approximately $277 million. Planned capital expenditures are $272 million and planned lease acquisition costs related to our operations in Europe are $5 million. Planned capital expenditures reflect $191 million focused on elevating the customer’s in-store experience. It also includes the remodeling and expansion of over 200 existing stores, the planned opening of approximately 90 stores primarily related to Kids Foot Locker in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the continued expansion of the Foot Locker banner in Europe. Planned spending for 2017 also includes $81 million for the development of information systems, including a new ecommerce order management system, websites, and infrastructure. We have the ability to revise and reschedule much of the anticipated capital expenditure program, should our financial position require it.  

 ﻿  

 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)  

 ﻿  

 In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of our strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management.   

 ﻿  

 Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.   

 ﻿  

 The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿

Operating Activities  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The amount provided by operating activities reflects income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include non-cash impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense and related tax benefits.   

 ﻿  

 The improvements in both 2016 and 2015 represented the Company’s earnings strength and working capital improvements. During 2016, we contributed $33 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and $3 million to our Canadian qualified pension plan, as compared with $4 million contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015. Pension contributions were $6 million in 2014. The amounts and timing of pension contributions are dependent on several factors, including asset performance. Cash paid for income taxes was $341 million, $283 million, and $251 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Investing Activities  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Capital expenditures in 2016 were $266 million, an increase of $38 million as compared with the prior year. The increase was due, in part, to the build out of our new corporate headquarters and two new flagship stores in New York City. Current year capital expenditures also reflects increased spending on corporate technology projects. During 2016, we completed the remodeling or relocation of 218 existing stores and opened 96 new stores. As of the end of fiscal 2016, approximately 40 percent of our domestic Foot Locker and Champs Sports stores, approximately one third of our stores in Europe, and approximately 25 percent of the Footaction stores have been remodeled to their respective new store formats.  

 ﻿  

 Capital expenditures in 2015 were $228 million, primarily related to the remodeling of 209 stores, the build-out of 111 new stores, and various corporate technology upgrades. This was an increase of $38 million as compared with 2014, as the timing of certain projects shifted to 2015.   

 ﻿  

 During the third quarter of 2015, we completed an asset acquisition for $2 million involving 10 previously franchised Runners Point and Sidestep stores in Switzerland.   

 ﻿  

 During 2014, we sold real estate for proceeds of $5 million and recorded a gain on sale of $4 million. In addition, maturities of short-term investments totaled $9 million in 2014.   

 ﻿  

 Financing Activities  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of our return to shareholders initiatives, including our share repurchase program and cash dividend payments, as follows:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 27  

During 2016, 2015, and 2014, we repurchased 6,984,643 shares, 6,693,100 shares, and 5,888,698 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, respectively. Additionally, the Company declared and paid dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.275, $0.25, and $0.22 per share in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Offsetting the amounts above were proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $33 million, $69 million, and $22 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In connection with stock option exercises, we recorded excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $20 million, $35 million, and $12 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In connection with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be recorded to the income statement rather than to equity as of the beginning of 2017. Additionally, with the adoption of this ASU, excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be classified as cash flows from operations.  

 ﻿  

 In May 2016, we entered into a new $400 million credit agreement and in connection with this transaction we paid fees of $2 million.  

 ﻿  

 The financing activity also includes payments on capital lease obligations of $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These obligations were recorded in connection with the acquisition of the Runners Point Group.  

 ﻿  

 Capital Structure  

 ﻿  

 On May 19, 2016, we entered into a new credit agreement with our banks (“2016 Credit Agreement”) that replaced the prior credit agreement (“2011 Restated Credit Agreement”). The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on May 19, 2021. During the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement, we may also increase the commitments by up to $200 million, subject to customary conditions. Interest is determined, at our option, by the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.125 percent to 0.375 percent, or a Eurodollar rate, determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.125 percent to 1.375 percent depending on availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement. In addition, we will pay a commitment fee of 0.20 percent per annum on the unused portion of the commitments.  

 ﻿  

 The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of our domestic store assets, including inventory assets, accounts receivable, cash deposits, and certain insurance proceeds. We are not required to comply with any financial covenants unless certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, or if availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement does not exceed the greater of $40 million and 10 percent of the Loan Cap (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement). There are no restrictions relating to the payment of dividends and share repurchases as long as no default or event of default has occurred and the aggregate principal amount of unused commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement is not less than 15 percent of the lesser of the aggregate amount of the commitments and the Borrowing Base, determined as of the preceding fiscal month and on a proforma basis for the following six fiscal months.   

 ﻿  

 We do not currently expect to borrow under the facility in 2017, other than amounts used to support standby letters of credit.  

 ﻿  

 Credit Rating  

 ﻿  

 As of March 23, 2017, our corporate credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are BB+ and Ba1, respectively. In addition, Moody’s Investors Service has rated our senior unsecured notes Ba2.  

 ﻿  

 28  

 Debt Capitalization and Equity (non-GAAP Measure)  

 ﻿  

 For purposes of calculating debt to total capitalization, we include the present value of operating lease commitments in total net debt. Total net debt including the present value of operating leases is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The present value of operating leases is discounted using various interest rates ranging from 2.5 percent to 14.5 percent, which represent our incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the inclusion of the present value of operating leases in total debt is useful to our investors, credit constituencies, and rating agencies.   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Cash and cash equivalents increased by $25 million during 2016, which was the result of strong cash flow generation from operating activities. Including the present value of operating leases, net debt capitalization percent increased by 110 basis points in 2016, reflecting the effect of new leases related to flagship locations and ongoing lease renewals, partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations.   

 ﻿  

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments

 The following tables represent the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at January 28, 2017:

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 ﻿  

 The majority of our contractual obligations relate to operating leases for our stores. Future scheduled lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of January 28, 2017 are described in the table under Contractual Obligations and Commitments on the preceding page and with additional information in the Leases note in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”   

 ﻿  

 We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities. Also, our financial policies prohibit the use of derivatives for which there is no underlying exposure.  

 ﻿  

 In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, we may be obligated for certain lease commitments transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot be readily determined, we believe that the resolution of such contingencies will not significantly affect our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. We also operate certain stores for which lease agreements are in the process of being negotiated with landlords. Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that leases will be executed.  

 ﻿  

 Critical Accounting Policies   

 ﻿  

 Our responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements requires diligent application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, our accounting policies and methods are those specifically required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” is a summary of the most significant accounting policies.   

 ﻿  

 In some cases, we are required to calculate amounts based on estimates for matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments.  

 ﻿  

 Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales  

 ﻿  

 Merchandise inventories for the Athletic Stores segment are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (“RIM”). The RIM is commonly used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its practicality. Under the retail method, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis.   

 ﻿  

 The RIM is a system of averages that requires estimates and assumptions regarding markups, markdowns and shrink, among others, and as such, could result in distortions of inventory amounts. Judgment is required for these estimates and assumptions, as well as to differentiate between promotional and other markdowns that may be required to correctly reflect merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market. Reserves are established based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. The failure to take permanent markdowns on a timely basis may result in an overstatement of cost under the retail inventory method. The decision to take permanent markdowns includes many factors, including the current retail environment, inventory levels, and the age of the item. We believe this method and its related assumptions, which have been consistently applied, to be reasonable.  

 30  

Impairment of Long-Lived Tangible Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangibles  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   Other Intangibles    Owned trademarks and trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment. Our impairment evaluation for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of either a qualitative or quantitative assessment, similar to the process for goodwill.   

   ﻿       

 31  

   Other Intangibles, continued    If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to proceed directly to a quantitative assessment, we calculate the fair value using a discounted cash flow method, based on the relief-from-royalty concept, and compare the fair value to the carrying value to determine if the asset is impaired. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates, and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.    

   ﻿       

   ﻿    Our 2016 annual assessment using the qualitative method did not result in an impairment charge. During the third quarter of 2016, we also performed a quantitative assessment of certain tradenames as a result of a triggering event, and this review did not result in an impairment charge. During the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of a triggering event, we recorded an impairment charge for indefinite-lived intangibles of $1 million.     

 ﻿  

 Share-Based Compensation  

 ﻿  

 We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model requires the use of subjective assumptions. Changes in these assumptions, listed below, can materially affect the fair value of the options.   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Share-based compensation expense is recorded for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on the Company’s historical pre-vesting forfeiture data. As of the beginning of 2017, in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we have made the accounting policy election to discontinue estimating forfeitures and will account for forfeitures as they occur using a modified retrospective approach.  

 ﻿  

 Legal Contingencies  

 ﻿  

 We are exposed to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The accrual is recorded based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. In 2015, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million related to the pension plan litigation.  

 ﻿  

 There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. We believe the accruals recorded within the consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.    

 ﻿  

 32  

Pension and Postretirement Liabilities  

 ﻿  

 We review all assumptions used to determine our obligations for pension and postretirement liabilities annually with our independent actuaries, taking into consideration existing and future economic conditions and our intentions with regard to the plans. The assumptions used are:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 We expect to record postretirement income of approximately $1 million and pension expense of approximately $19 million in 2017.  

 33  

Income Taxes  

 ﻿  

 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdiction and to use our judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset. Estimates of taxable income are based upon our long-range strategic plans.   

 ﻿  

 A one percent change in the overall statutory tax rate for 2016 would have resulted in a change of $5 million to the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge or credit to income tax expense depending on whether the tax rate change was a decrease or an increase.  

 ﻿  

 We have operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals of tax contingencies require us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual results could vary from these estimates.  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of any nonrecurring items that may occur, we expect the 2017 effective tax rate to approximate 34 percent including the change required by ASC 718 for treatment of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation being recorded to the income tax provision rather than to equity. The actual tax rate will vary if the level of stock option exercise activity and the stock price at the vesting or exercise date differs from our expectations. Additionally, the tax rate will also depend on the level and mix of income earned in the United States, as compared with our international operations.
