Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  

The following list describes several risk factors that are unique to our company. The risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC. These risks factors are being disclosed based on instructions set forth in Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K.  

Economic conditions and volatility in the financial markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  

Continued recessionary trends in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in the future. Economic conditions may continue to cause customers to reduce or delay purchases from us and may cause vendors to reduce their production or change their terms of sale to us. Volatility and other disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect the cost and availability of credit to us, as well as the cost of, and ability to, sell finance contracts we receive from customers to outside financial institutions.  

We compete in distribution industries that are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.  

Our competitors include numerous manufacturers and distributors. Some of our competitors may have different resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. Many of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several different distributors.

 Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Our failure to compete effectively may limit and/or reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow.  

Acquisitions of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital.   

As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired businesses in the ordinary course and expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition-related earnings charges.  

Our international operations are subject to risks that could adversely affect our operating results.  

There are a number of risks inherent in foreign operations, which include regulatory, economic and political requirements and changes. Additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar.  

Our future operating results can be affected by our relationships with our sales representatives and vendors and manufacturers of products that we distribute.  

The inability to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or build or maintain relationships with vendors and manufacturers of products that we distribute may have an adverse effect on our business.  

Interruptions with our vendors could adversely affect our operating results.  

We are dependent on our vendors to supply products. If a vendor is unable to deliver product in a timely and efficient manner, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience lost sales. In addition, a portion of our products are sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States. Political or financial instability, increased tariffs, restrictions on trade, currency exchange rates, labor unrest, outbreak of pandemics or other events could slow distribution activities and affect foreign trade beyond our control and adversely affect our results of operations.  

We sell products that could be subject to market and technological obsolescence.  

We carry over 100,000 different product stock keeping units. Some of these products are subject to technological obsolescence that may not be within the control of the Company since we do not manufacture the products. If we were no longer able to sell these products due to customers making decisions not to buy them, we may have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock that would adversely impact our operating results.  

Audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.  

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.  

We are subject to a variety of litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  

We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of products we distribute, claims relating to intellectual property matters, and claims involving

 employment matters. We also may be subject to securities litigation, although we have no reason to believe that any cause for such action exists today.  

The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managementÂ’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.  

Leadership Development and Succession Planning  

Our business could suffer if it loses key personnel unexpectedly or fails to provide for an orderly management succession. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to recruit skilled personnel for the business, and then identify and train our personnel for their transition into key roles to support the long-term growth of the business. While our board of directors and management actively monitor our succession plan and processes, any sudden change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business.  

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.  

Our balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, if impairment of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination.  

We are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates.  

Our balance sheet includes some variable rate long-term debt and certain non-current assets that are sensitive to movements in short-term interest rates. The variable rates are comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and reset on certain dates, as prescribed by the respective agreements. In addition, our balance sheet includes fixed rate long-term debt, whose fair value could be adversely affected by movements in interest rates. We finance purchases by our customers using finance contracts that are issued at fixed interest rates, and sell these contracts under various funding arrangements that are priced using variable interest rates. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if there are sudden and dramatic changes in the interest rates within the markets.
