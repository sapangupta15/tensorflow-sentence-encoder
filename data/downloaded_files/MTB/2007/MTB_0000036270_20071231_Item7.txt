Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

 Corporate Profile and Significant Developments  

 M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $64.9 billion at December 31, 2007. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.).  

 M&T Bank, with total assets of $64.1 billion at December 31, 2007, is a New York-chartered commercial bank with 704 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although residential and commercial real estate loans are originated through lending offices in 20 other states. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi-family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency.  

 M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $376 million at December 31, 2007, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques.  

 On November 30, 2007, M&T acquired Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. (Partners Trust), a bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New York. Partners Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary of Partners Trust, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Partners Trust Bank operated 33  

 29   
 branch offices in upstate New York at the date of acquisition. The results of operations acquired in the Partners Trust transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since November 30, 2007, but did not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations in 2007. After application of the election, allocation and proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for Partners Trust shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger agreement, M&T paid $9 million in cash to holders of outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Partners Trust. The purchase price was approximately $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged, and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options. The acquisition of Partners Trust expands M&Ts presence in upstate New York, making M&T Bank the deposit market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets, while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.  

 Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007 totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans and leases, (largely residential real estate and consumer loans), liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and time deposits), and $277 million was added to stockholders equity. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $288 million of goodwill and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over 7 years using an accelerated method.  

 As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three of the acquired branch offices in Binghamton, New York having approximately $95 million of deposits as of June 30, 2006. M&T Bank has reached an agreement to sell three branches in a transaction expected to close in 2008.  

 On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired the Mid-Atlantic retail banking franchise of First Horizon Bank (First Horizon), a subsidiary of First Horizon National Corporation, in a cash transaction, including $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and $80 million of trust and investment assets under management. The transaction did not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations during 2007. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded approximately $15 million of core deposit and other intangible assets that are being amortized using accelerated methods over a weighted average life of 7 years.  

 The Company incurred merger-related expenses associated with the Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income taxes, or $.08 of diluted earnings per share) during 2007. Those expenses consisted largely of professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; costs related to branch and office consolidations; incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to customers of the acquired operations; travel costs; printing, postage and supplies; and other costs of commencing operations in new offices. The Company expects to incur additional merger-related expenses relating to those transactions, although such costs are expected to be substantially less than the amount incurred in 2007. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Partners Trust acquisition were charges totaling $14 million, net of applicable income taxes ($18 million before tax effect), for severance costs for former Partners Trust employees, termination of Partners Trust contracts for various services and other items. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining unpaid portion of merger-related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill were $5 million and $13 million, respectively. The resolution of Partners Trusts preacquisition contingencies in future periods could have an impact on the purchase price and the amount of goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition, however, management does not presently expect that any such adjustments will be material to the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  

 On February 5, 2007, M&T invested $300 million to acquire a minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC (BLG), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender that specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans in the United States, and to a significantly lesser extent, in Canada and the United Kingdom. M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of accounting. M&Ts pro-rata portion of the results of operations of BLG was pre-tax  

 30   
 income of $9 million ($5 million after tax effect) in 2007, which has been recorded as a component of other income in the consolidated statement of income. Including expenses associated with M&Ts investment in BLG, most notably interest expense, that investment reduced the Companys net income in 2007 by $4 million (after tax effect) or $.04 per diluted share.  

 On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million of loans, mostly to consumers, small businesses and middle market customers, and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits. Expenses associated with integrating the acquired branches into M&T Bank and introducing the customers associated with those branches to M&T Banks products and services aggregated $3 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2006.  

 Critical Accounting Estimates  

 The Companys significant accounting policies conform with GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:  

       Allowance for credit losses  The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses.   

       Valuation methodologies  Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock-based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include investment securities, other investments, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion    

 31   
      and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.    

       Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements  Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding the Companys income taxes is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.    

 Overview  

 The Companys net income for 2007 was $654 million or $5.95 of diluted earnings per common share, representing declines of 22% and 19%, respectively, from $839 million or $7.37 of diluted earnings per share in 2006. Basic earnings per common share decreased 20% to $6.05 in 2007 from $7.55 in 2006. Net income in 2005 aggregated $782 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $6.73 and $6.88, respectively. The after-tax impact of acquisition and integration-related expenses (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated with the November 30 acquisition of Partners Trust and the December 7 transaction with First Horizon was $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of basic and diluted earnings per share in 2007. Similar costs related to the June 30, 2006 branch acquisition were $3 million ($5 million pre-tax) or $.03 of basic and diluted earnings per share in 2006. There were no similar expenses in 2005. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2007 was 1.12%, compared with 1.50% in 2006 and 1.44% in 2005. The return on average common stockholders equity was 10.47% in 2007, 13.89% in 2006 and 13.49% in 2005.  

 The Companys financial results for 2007 were adversely impacted by several events. Turmoil in the residential real estate market, which began in early 2007, significantly affected the Companys financial results in a number of ways. Problems experienced by lenders in the sub-prime residential mortgage lending market also had negative repercussions on the rest of the residential real estate marketplace. Through early 2007, the Company had been an active participant in the origination of alternative (Alt-A) residential real estate loans and the sale of such loans in the secondary market. Alt-A loans originated by M&T typically included some form of limited documentation requirements as compared with more traditional residential real estate loans. Unfavorable market conditions during the first quarter of 2007, including a lack of liquidity, impacted the Companys willingness to sell Alt-A loans, as an auction of such loans initiated by the Company received fewer bids than normal and the pricing of those bids was substantially lower than expected. As a result, $883 million of Alt-A loans previously held for sale (including $808 million of first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage loans) were transferred in March to the Companys held-for-investment loan portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale must be recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the Alt-A mortgage loans to the held-for-investment portfolio, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by $12 million ($7 million after tax effect, or $.07 of diluted earnings per share). Those loans were reclassified because management believed at that time that the value of the Alt-A residential real estate loans was greater than the amount implied by the few bidders who were active in the market. The downturn in the residential real estate market, specifically related to declining real estate valuations and higher delinquencies, continued throughout the remainder of 2007 and had a negative  

 32   
 effect on the majority of financial institutions active in residential real estate lending. Margins earned by the Company from sales of residential real estate loans in the secondary market were lower in 2007 than in 2006.  

 The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase some previously sold residential real estate loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria, including instances where mortgagors fail to make timely payments during the first 90 days subsequent to the sale date. Requests from investors for the Company to repurchase residential real estate loans increased significantly in early 2007, particularly related to Alt-A loans. As a result, during 2007s first quarter the Company reduced mortgage banking revenues by $6 million ($4 million after tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share) related to declines in market values of previously sold residential real estate loans that the Company may be required to repurchase.  

 The Company had $1.2 billion of Alt-A residential real estate loans in its held-for-investment loan portfolio at December 31, 2007. Lower real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs contributed to increased losses in that portfolio during 2007, which led to an assessment of the Companys accounting practices during the fourth quarter as they relate to the timing of the classification of residential real estate loans as nonaccrual and when such loans are charged off. Residential real estate loans previously classified as nonaccrual when payments were 180 days past due now stop accruing interest when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days. The excess of such loan balances over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is now charged off when the loans become 150 days delinquent, whereas previously the Company provided an allowance for credit losses for such amounts and charged-off loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property. The impact of the acceleration of the classification of residential real estate loans as nonaccrual resulted in an increase in nonperforming loans of $84 million at December 31, 2007 and a corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and accruing interest. As a result of that acceleration, previously accrued interest of $2 million was reversed and charged against income. Included in the $114 million of net charge-offs for 2007 were $15 million resulting from the change in accounting procedure. The declining residential real estate values also contributed to specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses related to two residential real estate builders and developers during the fourth quarter of 2007. Considering these and other factors as discussed herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses, the Company significantly increased the provision for credit losses in 2007 to $192 million, compared with $80 million in 2006.  

 The turmoil in the residential real estate market in 2007 also negatively affected the Companys investment securities portfolio. Three collateralized debt obligations were purchased in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately $132 million. The securities are backed largely by residential mortgage-backed securities (collateralized by a mix of prime, mid-prime and sub-prime residential mortgage loans) and are held in the Companys available-for-sale portfolio. Although these securities were highly rated when purchased, two of the three securities were downgraded by the rating agencies in late-2007. After a thorough analysis, management concluded that the impairment of the market value of these securities was other than temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $127 million ($78 million after tax effect, or $.71 of diluted earnings per share) in the fourth quarter of 2007. The impairment charge reduced the Companys exposure to collateralized debt obligations backed by residential mortgage securities to approximately $4 million.  

 Finally, during the last quarter of 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering (IPO) expected to occur in 2008. As part of that reorganization M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of common stock of Visa, Inc. Those banks are also obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation involving Visa (Covered Litigation). Although Visa is expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the Covered Litigation, recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates that Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of the Companys proportionate share of any potential losses related to the Covered Litigation is extremely difficult and involves a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted  

 33   
 share) related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in Visa, Inc.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 2% to $1.87 billion in 2007 from $1.84 billion in 2006. The impact of higher average earning asset balances was largely offset by a decline in the Companys net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Average earning assets increased 5% to $52.0 billion in 2007 from $49.7 billion in 2006 due to higher loan and lease balances, partially offset by lower average balances of investment securities. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2007 rose $2.7 billion or 7% to $44.1 billion from $41.4 billion in 2006, the result of growth in commercial loans and leases of $858 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of $653 million, or 4%, consumer real estate loans of $1.0 billion, or 20%, and consumer loans and leases of $186 million, or 2%. The $2.4 billion of loans acquired in the Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions did not have a significant impact on average loans and leases for 2007. The average balance of investment securities outstanding declined $717 million, or 9%, to $7.3 billion in 2007 from $8.0 billion in 2006 due largely to net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and U.S. federal agency securities. The Companys net interest margin narrowed 10 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in 2006. That narrowing was the result of several factors, including higher rates paid on deposit accounts and variable-rate borrowings that were only partially offset by higher yields earned on loans and investment securities.  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis in 2006 was 1% higher than $1.81 billion in 2005. The positive impact of higher average earning assets was largely offset by a decline in net interest margin. Average earning assets rose 3% to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005, the result of increased balances of loans and leases, offset, in part, by a decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities. Average loans and leases of $41.4 billion in 2006 were $1.9 billion or 5% higher than $39.5 billion in 2005, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $863 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of $755 million, or 5%, and consumer real estate loans of $1.1 billion, or 28%, partially offset by an $804 million, or 7%, decline in consumer loans and leases. Average balances of investment securities decreased 5% to $8.0 billion in 2006 from $8.5 billion in 2005. The net interest margin declined 7 basis points to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005, largely due to higher short-term interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate 100 basis points during the first six months of 2006, continuing a trend of rate increases that began in June 2004. Such interest rate increases had the effect of increasing rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earning assets during 2005 and the first half of 2006.  

 The provision for credit losses rose to $192 million in 2007 from $80 million in 2006 and $88 million in 2005. Deteriorating credit conditions that were reflected in rising levels of charge-offs and delinquencies as well as rapidly declining residential real estate valuations during 2007 and their impact on the Companys portfolio of Alt-A residential mortgage loans and loans to residential builders and developers contributed significantly to the increase in the provision from 2006 to 2007. The levels of the provision during 2006 and 2005 were reflective of generally favorable credit quality during those years. Net charge-offs were $114 million in 2007, up from $68 million in 2006 and $77 million in 2005. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding rose to .26% in 2007 from .16% in 2006 and .19% in 2005. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.  

 Noninterest income declined 11% to $933 million in 2007 from $1.05 billion in 2006. That decline resulted from the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 related to collateralized debt obligations held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The market value of those collateralized debt obligations, which are backed by residential mortgage-backed securities, declined sharply as a result of the residential real estate market crisis in 2007. That charge is reflected in losses from bank investment securities in the consolidated statement of income. Excluding the impairment charge, noninterest income was $1.06 billion in 2007, 1% higher than in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains, and  

 34   
 $9 million related to M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG were largely offset by a $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues. Contributing to the decline in mortgage banking revenues were changing market conditions, which led to slimmer margins realized on sales of residential real estate loans. In addition, the Company recognized $18 million of losses in the first quarter related to its Alt-A loan portfolio due to declines in the market values of such loans. Included in noninterest income in 2006 was a $13 million gain resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition.  

 Noninterest income in 2006 increased 10% from $950 million in 2005. In addition to the $13 million gain noted above, higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Furthermore, losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a $29 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses in both years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006, noninterest income rose 5% from 2005 to 2006.  

 Noninterest expense in 2007 aggregated $1.63 billion, up 5% from $1.55 billion in 2006. Noninterest expense in 2005 was $1.49 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $66 million, $63 million and $57 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and merger- related expenses of $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. There were no merger-related expenses in 2005. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.55 billion in 2007, $1.48 billion in 2006 and $1.43 billion in 2005. Noninterest operating expenses in 2007 included a $23 million charge representing the Companys estimated liability related to litigation involving Visa as already discussed. Included in operating expenses in 2006 was an $18 million tax-deductible contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. There were no similar contributions made in 2007 or in 2005. Excluding the impact of the Visa charge in 2007 and the charitable contribution in 2006, operating expenses in 2007 were up 4% from 2006, largely due to a higher level of salaries and employee benefits expense reflecting the impact of merit pay increases, increased incentive compensation and higher costs for providing medical benefits to employees. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased $37 million, or 3%, from 2005. The most significant contributor to that increase was a higher level of salaries expense, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases and higher stock-based compensation costs and other incentive pay.  

 The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 52.8% in 2007, compared with 51.5% in 2006 and 51.2% in 2005.

  (a)    Changes were calculated from unrounded amounts.  

  (b)    Interest income data are on a taxable-equivalent basis. The taxable-equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 39% for 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and 36% for 2003.   

 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations  

 As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.4 billion at December 31, 2007, $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.9 billion at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $40 million, $38 million and $35 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, in which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with integrating acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.  

 Net operating income totaled $704 million in 2007, compared with $881 million in 2006. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2007 declined 17% to $6.40 from $7.73 in 2006. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share were $817 million and $7.03, respectively, during 2005.  

 Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share are presented in table 2.  

 Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.27% in 2007, compared with 1.67% in 2006 and 1.60% in 2005. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 22.58% in 2007, compared with 29.55% and 29.06% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

 Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis increased 2% to $1.87 billion in 2007 from $1.84 billion in 2006, largely the result of growth in average earning assets. Such assets aggregated $52.0 billion in 2007, 5% higher than $49.7 billion in 2006. Growth in average loan and lease balances outstanding, which rose 7% to $44.1 billion in 2007 from $41.4 billion in 2006, was the leading factor in that improvement, partially offset by a decline of $717 million, or 9%, in average balances of investment securities. A lower net interest margin, which declined to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in 2006, partially offset the positive impact on taxable-equivalent net interest income resulting from growth in average earning assets.  

 The Company experienced growth in all major loan categories in 2007, particularly during the second half of the year. Average commercial loans and leases increased 8% to $12.2 billion in 2007 from $11.3 billion in 2006. Commercial real estate loans averaged $15.7 billion in 2007, up 4% from $15.1 billion in 2006, due, in part, to higher average balances of construction loans. Average residential real estate loans rose 20% in 2007 to $6.0 billion from $5.0 billion in 2006. In March 2007, the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A residential real estate loans from the Companys held-for-sale loan portfolio to its held-for-investment portfolio. Residential real estate loans held for sale averaged $1.1 billion in 2007 and $1.5 billion during 2006. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.2 billion in 2007, up 2% from $10.0 billion in 2006, due in part to growth in the automobile loan portfolio. Annualized growth experienced during 2007s fourth quarter as compared with the third quarter of 2007 for average commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans and leases were 8%, 22%, 6% and 14%, respectively, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter acquisition transactions.  

 Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was largely offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 1% to $1.84 billion in 2006 from $1.81 billion in 2005. Average earning assets increased 3% to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005. That growth resulted from a 5% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases of $1.9 billion, offset in part by a 5% decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities of $441 million. The positive impact of higher average earning assets on taxable-equivalent net interest income was largely offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005.  

 Average loans and leases outstanding aggregated $41.4 billion in 2006, up 5% from $39.5 billion in 2005. The higher average outstanding loan balances were the result of growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans. Average commercial loans and leases rose 8% to $11.3 billion in 2006 from $10.5 billion in 2005. Commercial real estate loans averaged $15.1 billion during 2006, 5% higher than $14.3 billion in 2005, reflecting a $336 million rise in construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The Companys residential real estate loan portfolio averaged $5.0 billion in 2006, up 28% from $3.9 billion in 2005. Included in that portfolio were loans held for sale, which averaged $1.5 billion in 2006, 19% above the $1.2 billion averaged in 2005. Excluding such loans, average residential real estate loans increased $861 million from 2005 to 2006. That increase was largely the result of the Companys decision to retain higher levels of residential real estate loans having certain characteristics, due to narrowing margins available in the marketplace when selling such loans and the lack of availability of investment securities to acquire that met the Companys desired characteristics and provided suitable returns. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.0 billion in 2006, down 7% from $10.8 billion in 2005. That decline was the result of lower average balances of automobile loans and leases, which decreased 22% to $2.9 billion in 2006 from $3.7 billion in 2005, reflecting the Companys decision to allow such balances to decline rather than matching interest rates offered by competitors. During late 2006, the interest rate environment relating to the Companys automobile lending business improved and from September 30 to December 31, outstanding balances of such loans increased slightly.

 Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, aggregated $13.1 billion at December 31, 2007, representing 27% of total loans and leases. Approximately $259 million of commercial loans were obtained in the December 2007 acquisition transactions. Table 5 presents information on commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2007 relating to geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $13.1 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2007, approximately $10.4 billion, or 80%, were secured, while 51%, 23% and 12% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2007 aggregated $1.4 billion, of which 47% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 13% were secured by collateral in Maryland and another 11% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.  

 International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $107 million and $176 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $1 million to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these programs at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $95 million and $143 million, respectively.

 Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 61% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2007, compared with 62% in 2006 and 60% in 2005. At December 31, 2007, the Company held approximately $17.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $6.2 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties (including $774 million of loans held for sale) and $5.5 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $15.4 billion, $6.0 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Loans obtained in the December 2007 acquisition transactions included $343 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential mortgages and $269 million of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit.  

 A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon, West Virginia and other states. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction loans, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 49% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2007. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2007. Of the $6.0 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 28% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 44% by retail space and 9% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 57% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less, while loans of more than $15 million made up approximately 34% of the total.

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 70% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 72% and 51%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less.  

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 15% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2007.  

 Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6 totaled $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007, or 6% of total loans and leases. Approximately 94% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2007 were $1.5 billion of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multi-family residential housing, retail space and other commercial development.  

 M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by FNMA and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $1.0 billion and $939 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2007 and 2006 aggregated $79 million and $49 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  

 Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $6.2 billion at December 31, 2007, including approximately 33% secured by properties located in New York State, 14% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 10% secured by properties located in Maryland. At December 31, 2007, $774 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006. That decline in residential real estate loans held for sale resulted largely from the Companys decision during 2007 to not actively participate in the Alt-A market. As already discussed, in March 2007 the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A loans secured by residential real estate properties from its held-for-sale portfolio to its held-for-investment loan portfolio. The Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment at December 31, 2007 totaled $1.2 billion, compared with $584 million and $75 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Loans to individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties totaled $417 million at December 31, 2007, or approximately 1% of total loans and leases, compared with $693 million or 2% at December 31, 2006.  

 Consumer loans and leases comprised approximately 23% of the average loan portfolio during 2007, down from 24% in 2006 and 27% in 2005. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans and leases. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 9% of average loans outstanding in 2007 and 10% in 2006. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 7% of the Companys average loan portfolio during each of 2007 and 2006. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2007. Approximately 53% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2007 were secured by properties in New York State, and 20% and 21% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were approximately $4.2 billion in each of 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007, 34% and 24% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing  

 44   
 in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. From mid-2004 until late 2006, the Company experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business, resulting from increased competition from other lenders, including financing incentives offered by automobile manufacturers. Throughout that period, the Company chose not to match the pricing being offered by many competitors. Since late 2006, the pricing as it relates to those loans improved such that the Company began actively originating automobile loans, which resulted in outstanding balances in this portfolio increasing to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006.  

 The Company ceased origination of automobile leases during 2003. Automobile leases outstanding averaged approximately $15 million in 2007, compared with $53 million in 2006 and $137 million in 2005. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, outstanding automobile leases totaled $5 million and $29 million, respectively.  

 Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2007, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 49% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2007 were to New York State customers, while 19% and 12% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively.

  (a)    Includes loans secured by properties located in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City.   

 Balances of investment securities averaged $7.3 billion in 2007, compared with $8.0 billion and $8.5 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The declines in such securities during 2007 and 2006 largely reflect net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations  

 45   
 and U.S. federal agency securities. Until the second half of 2007, the Company had allowed the investment securities portfolio to decline as the opportunity to purchase securities at favorable spreads, that is, the difference between the yield earned on a security and the rate paid on funds used to purchase it, had been limited. During the third quarter of 2007, spreads on residential mortgage-backed securities became more favorable and the Company purchased approximately $800 million of collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed securities. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates or spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. During December 2007, the Company securitized approximately $950 million of residential real estate loans obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with FNMA. The Company recognized no gain or loss on the transaction as it retained all of the resulting securities, which are held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. As previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of $127 million related to collateralized debt obligations. The remaining balance of collateralized debt obligations backed by residential mortgage loans was $4 million at the 2007 year-end. During 2005 the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $29 million related to its holdings of preferred stock of FNMA and FHLMC. The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company concluded that the remaining declines were temporary in nature. Further discussion of that decision is included herein under the heading Capital. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $503 million in 2007, $183 million in 2006 and $113 million in 2005. Reflected in those balances were purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell which averaged $417 million and $50 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The average balance in 2005 was insignificant. The higher level of resell agreements in 2007 as compared with 2006 was due, in part, to the need to collateralize deposits of municipalities. There were no outstanding resell agreements at December 31, 2007. The amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.  

 The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Core deposits averaged $28.6 billion in 2007, $28.3 billion in 2006 and $27.9 billion in 2005. The Partners Trust and First Horizon acquisition transactions in late-2007 added $2.0 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition dates, however, the Companys average core deposits in 2007 only increased $156 million from those transactions. The previously discussed June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added approximately $880 million to average core deposits during the second half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The rise in average balances of time deposits less than $100,000 in 2006 as compared with 2005 was partially due to customer response to higher interest rates offered on those products, resulting in a shift of funds from savings and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to time deposits. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $208 million in 2007, $387 million in 2006 and $216 million in 2005. Funding provided by  

 46   
 core deposits represented 55% of average earning assets in 2007, compared with 57% in 2006 and 58% in 2005. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2007 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years.  

 Table 8  

 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.7 billion in 2007, $2.9 billion in 2006 and $1.8 billion in 2005. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $4.2 billion in 2007, $3.6 billion in 2006 and $3.8 billion in 2005. Average brokered time deposits totaled $2.1 billion in 2007, compared with $3.5 billion in 2006 and $2.7 billion in 2005, and at December 31, 2007 and 2006 totaled $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $205 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered money-market deposit accounts, which averaged $87 million, $69 million and $62 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.  

 The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various FHLBs, and others as sources of funding. The average balance of short-term borrowings was $5.4 billion in 2007, $4.5 billion in 2006 and $4.9 billion in 2005. Included in short-term borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, that averaged $4.6 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest component of short-term borrowings and are obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Also included in short-term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank, all of which was in use at the 2007, 2006 and 2005 year-ends. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The average balance of this borrowing was $437 million in 2007 and $500 million in each of 2006 and 2005. Additional information about M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Average short-term borrowings during 2007 included $160 million of borrowings from the FHLB of New York. There were no similar short-term borrowings in 2005 or 2006.  

 Long-term borrowings averaged $8.4 billion in 2007, $6.0 billion in 2006 and $6.4 billion in 2005. Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLBs of $4.3 billion in 2007 and $3.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and subordinated capital notes of $1.6 billion in 2007, $1.2 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. M&T Bank issued $400 million and $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2007 and 2006, respectively, in part to maintain appropriate regulatory  

 47   
 capital ratios. The notes issued in December 2007 bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in December 2017. The 2006 notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until December 2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in December 2021, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .64%. Beginning December 2016, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of those notes on any interest payment date. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of long-term debt. Those swap agreements are used to hedge approximately $637 million of fixed rate subordinated notes and $1.5 billion of long-term variable-rate FHLB borrowings. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $716 million, $712 million and $711 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged $1.6 billion, $258 million and $549 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The agreements, which were entered into due to favorable rates available, have various repurchase dates through 2017, however, the contractual maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such repurchase dates. Long-term borrowings include $300 million of senior notes issued by M&T in May 2007, which averaged $182 million during 2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.375% and mature in May 2012.  

 Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, declined 9 basis points from 3.10% in 2006 to 3.01% in 2007. The yield on earning assets during 2007 was 6.86%, 15 basis points higher than 6.71% in 2006, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points to 3.85% from 3.61% in 2006. The yield on the Companys earning assets rose 88 basis points in 2006 from 5.83% in 2005, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 2006 was up 110 basis points from 2.51% in 2005. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 3.32% in 2005 to 3.10% in 2006. During the period from February 2005 until June 29, 2006, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate twelve times, each increase representing a 25 basis point increment over the previously effective target rate. Specifically, during 2005, eight increases were initiated, while during the first half of 2006, four increases were initiated. Those rate increases resulted in the rates the Company paid on interest-bearing liabilities, most notably short-term borrowings, rising more rapidly than the yields on earning assets during 2005 and 2006. In September 2007, the Federal Reserve began lowering its federal funds target rate, first by 50 basis points, then two more times during the fourth quarter by 25 basis points. As a result, the rate of increase from 2006 to 2007 for interest rates earned and paid by the Company slowed, and during the final quarter of 2007, those rates actually declined as compared with that years third quarter. Contributing to the decline in net interest spread from 2006 to 2007 was the impact of funding the $300 million BLG investment in February 2007 as well as higher rates paid on deposits and variable-rate borrowings that were only partially offset by higher yields on loans and investment securities.  

 Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets and, in 2007, M&Ts investment in BLG. Net interest-free funds averaged $7.9 billion in 2007, compared with $8.2 billion in 2006 and $8.6 billion in 2005. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.2 billion in 2007, $3.1 billion in 2006, and $3.0 billion in 2005. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.1 billion in each of 2007 and 2006 and $1.0 billion in 2005. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .59% in 2007, .60% in 2006 and .45% in 2005. The impact of slightly higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities during 2007 as compared with 2006, which are used to value such contribution, was offset by the effect of a lower balance of interest-free funds. The rise in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2006 as  

 48   
 compared with 2005 resulted largely from the impact of significantly higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution.  

 Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.60% in 2007, compared with 3.70% in 2006 and 3.77% in 2005. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin.  

 Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007. Under the terms of $842 million of these swap agreements that are designated as fair value hedges, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates. Under the terms of the remaining $1.5 billion of swap agreements outstanding at the 2007 year-end that are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a gain of approximately $17 million at December 31, 2007 and a loss of approximately $15 million at December 31, 2006. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair values of the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges were losses of approximately $17 million at December 31, 2007. Net of applicable income taxes, such losses were approximately $10 million and have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. There were no swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2006. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. Additional information about those swap agreements and the items being hedged is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

 Provision for Credit Losses  

 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $192 million in 2007, up from $80 million in 2006 and $88 million in 2005. Net loan charge-offs increased to $114 million in 2007 from $68 million and $77 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .26% in 2007, compared with .16% in 2006 and .19% in 2005. The significant increase in the provision for credit losses in 2007 as compared with the two preceding years was due, in part, to a pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market. Declining real estate valuations and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs throughout 2007 significantly affected the quality of the Companys residential real estate loan portfolio. Specifically, the Companys Alt-A residential real estate loan portfolio and its residential real estate builder and developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of the credit problems related to the turmoil in the residential real estate marketplace. In response to the deteriorating quality of the Alt-A portfolio, the Company decided in 2007s fourth quarter to accelerate the timing related to when residential real estate loans are charged off. The excess of such loan balances over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is now charged off when the loan becomes past due 150 days, whereas the Companys past practice had been to provide an allowance for credit losses for such amounts and charge off those loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property. The change in accounting procedure resulted in $15 million of additional charge-offs in 2007. The declining real estate valuations also contributed to provisions for credit losses related to two residential builders and developers during the final quarter of 2007. A summary of the Companys loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.

 LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, aggregated $447 million or .93% of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2007, compared with $224 million or .52% at December 31, 2006 and $156 million or .39% at December 31, 2005. Major factors contributing to the rise in nonperforming loans from the 2006 year-end to December 31, 2007 were a $133 million increase in residential real estate loans and an $83 million increase in loans to residential builders and developers. The increase in nonperforming residential real estate loans was the result of the residential real estate market turmoil and its impact on the portfolio of Alt-A loans and reflected the change in accounting procedure in December 2007 whereby residential real estate loans previously classified as nonaccrual when payments were 180 days past due now stop accruing interest when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days. The impact of the acceleration of the classification of such loans as nonaccrual resulted in an increase in nonperforming loans of $84 million and a corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and accruing interest. The higher level of nonaccrual builder and developer loans was largely due to deteriorating residential real estate values. The increase in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2006 from a year earlier was largely due to the 2006 addition of four relationships with automobile dealers totaling approximately $41 million. During 2007, outstanding nonaccrual loan balances relating to those four relationships declined $36 million, largely the result of payments received.  

 51   
 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $77 million or .16% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2007, compared with $111 million or .26% at December 31, 2006 and $129 million or .32% at December 31, 2005. Those loans included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $73 million, $77 million and $106 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled $67 million at December 31, 2007, $65 million at December 31, 2006 and $79 million at December 31, 2005. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that totaled $5 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $11 million and $26 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.  

 Table 11  

 NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOAN DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Predominately residential mortgage loans.   

 Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and due to the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Likewise, residential real estate values in certain areas in the United States can be subject to rapid movements due to changes in economic conditions, interest rates and liquidity in the secondary markets for loans secured by residential real estate.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $24 million in 2007, $20 million in 2006 and $26 million in 2005. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases were $79 million at each of  

 52   
 December 31, 2007 and 2006, and $39 million at December 31, 2005. The addition of a number of smaller credits (less than $5 million) to the nonperforming loan category during 2007 was largely offset by a $27 million net decline in nonperforming loans to automobile dealers predominantly due to payments received. Reflecting the granularity of the Companys commercial loan and lease portfolio, there were only two loans classified as nonperforming in the portfolio that exceeded $5 million. The increase from the 2005 year-end to December 31, 2006 largely reflects the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers aggregating $41 million. Continued slowing of domestic automobile sales in 2006 resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results. As noted above, during 2007 the Companys nonperforming automobile dealer loans declined significantly.   

 Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2007 and 2006 were $6 million and $1 million, respectively, compared with net recoveries of $1 million in 2005. Reflected in 2007s charge-offs were $4 million related to loans to residential real estate builders and developers. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming totaled $118 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $57 million at December 31, 2006 and $44 million at December 31, 2005. The rise in such loans during 2007 was the result of the addition of $83 million of loans to residential homebuilders and developers, reflecting the impact of the downturn in the residential real estate market, including declining real estate values. The increase from the end of 2005 to the 2006 year-end was largely due to the addition of a $10 million loan to an assisted living facility (which was subsequently paid off in 2007).  

 Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries, were $19 million in 2007, $4 million in 2006 and $2 million in 2005. Nonperforming residential real estate loans at the end of 2007 totaled $181 million, compared with $42 million and $29 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As already noted, the significant increase in such loans from December 31, 2006 includes the effect of the change in accounting procedure for nonaccrual residential real estate loans. Declining real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies have also contributed to the rise in residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual, largely in the Companys Alt-A portfolio, and to the level of charge-offs. Included in residential real estate loan net charge-offs and nonperforming loans were net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2007 of $12 million, while nonperforming Alt-A loans aggregated $90 million at the 2007 year-end. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2006 were insignificant and nonperforming Alt-A loans at December 31, 2006 totaled $19 million. The Company did not have any Alt-A charge-offs in 2005, nor any nonperforming Alt-A loans at the 2005 year-end. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $66 million, $92 million and $96 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government-related entities.  

 Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases during 2007 were $65 million, representing .63% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $43 million or .43% in 2006 and $50 million or .47% in 2005. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of indirect automobile loans and leases were $28 million during 2007, $24 million during 2006 and $37 million during 2005. Consumer loan charge-offs also include recreational vehicle loans and leases of $11 million, $9 million and $8 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $16 million during 2007 and $2 million during each of 2006 and 2005. The increase in charge-offs of home equity loans and lines of credit from 2006 to 2007 was largely due to a rise in Alt-A charge-offs. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases were $69 million at December 31, 2007, representing .61% of outstanding consumer loans and leases, compared with $46 million or .46% at December 31, 2006 and $44 million or .42% at December 31, 2005. The Company experienced a rise in delinquencies in the consumer loan portfolio during 2007, as compared with the preceding two years. At the 2007, 2006 and 2005 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent 30-90 days totaled $155 million, $122 million and $115 million, respectively, or 1.38%, 1.23% and 1.10% of outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $1 million at each of December 31, 2007 and 2005, and $3 million at December 31, 2006.  

 53   
 Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the impact of declining residential real estate values on the Companys portfolio of loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the Companys portfolio of Alt-A residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis.  

 Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2007 in light of (i) the declining residential real estate values and emergence of higher levels of delinquencies of residential real estate loans; (ii) the sluggish pace of economic growth in many of the markets served by the Company; (iii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and (v) the amount of loan growth experienced by the Company in late 2007. Although the national economy experienced moderate growth in 2006 and 2007 with inflation being reasonably well contained, concerns exist about the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakening housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; sluggish job creation and rising unemployment, which could cause consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans should consumer spending slow; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of domestic automobile sales.  

 In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114.  

 The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually  

 54   
 assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards.  

 Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral values, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry.  

 To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories, beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for certain national and local economic conditions have been included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result, probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans, have been included in the inherent base level loss components at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  

 In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on internally and externally prepared valuations. In 2007, valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes in loans in assigned loan grades due to the elapse of time between the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality and, accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2007. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market was 0.5%, or well below the 1.3% national average. The manufacturing-oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company and in Maryland matched the national average. The results for the Pennsylvania markets are particularly noteworthy since job growth in that region had significantly lagged national averages for several years prior to 2007. Job growth in New York City (1.8%) and the Greater Washington D.C. region (1.8%) was higher than the national average in 2007. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about a possible economic recession, real estate valuations, high levels of consumer indebtedness, high and volatile energy prices, weak population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions that lagged national population growth trends and other factors, continue to indicate to management an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York and Pennsylvania where two-thirds of its lending business is conducted.  

 The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance  

 55   
 represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as: (i) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (ii) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; and (iii) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance.   

 A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 12. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components, including the impact of the increased delinquencies and nonaccrual loans that are secured by residential real estate in 2007, and beginning in 2006, the allocation of losses that were previously unallocated for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations, certain national and local economic conditions, and other factors. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $225 million at December 31, 2007 and $153 million at December 31, 2006. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $55 million at December 31, 2007 and $23 million at December 31, 2006. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .19% and .21% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of real estate loans and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category.  

 Table 12  

 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2007 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $759 million or 1.58% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2007, compared with $650 million or 1.51% at December 31, 2006 and $638 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2005. The increase in the level  

 56   
 of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2007 as compared with a year earlier reflects managements evaluation of the loan portfolio as described herein, including the impact of lower residential real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs in the Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans and lower residential real estate valuations related to loans to residential builders and developers. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases from the 2005 year-end to December 31, 2006 reflects managements evaluation of the loan portfolio as described herein, including a change in portfolio mix resulting from higher balances of residential real estate loans and lower balances of consumer loans. In general, through 2006 the Company had historically experienced significantly lower charge-off rates on residential real estate loans than on consumer loans. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 170%, 290% and 408%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.  

 In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows the methodology described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality:  

       For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20% increase in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were:  

       For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $63 million in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $15 million reduction in such losses could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors.  

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties used in providing retail goods and services in the New York City metropolitan area represented 6% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2007. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2007. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $107 million at December 31, 2007, or .2% of total loans and leases.  

 Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $40 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $12 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase from the prior year-ends to December 31, 2007 resulted from higher residential real estate loan defaults in 2007.  

 57   
 Other Income  

 Other income declined 11% to $933 million in 2007 from $1.05 billion in 2006. That decline resulted from the previously discussed $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 related to collateralized debt obligations held in M&Ts available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding that charge, other income was $1.06 billion in 2007, 1% higher than in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains, and $9 million related to M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG were largely offset by a $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues and a $13 million gain in 2006 from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million borrowing from the FHLB of Atlanta. The December 2007 acquisition transactions did not contribute significantly to other income in 2007.  

 Other income in 2006 was 10% above the $950 million earned in 2005. Higher levels of mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Included in other income for 2006 was the $13 million gain related to the call of an FHLB borrowing, while other income in 2005 reflected a $29 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to the Companys investment in certain preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities from both years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006, other income increased 5% from 2005 to 2006.  

 Mortgage banking revenues were $112 million in 2007, $143 million in 2006 and $136 million in 2005. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities is largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program.  

 Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees and income, decreased 25% to $86 million in 2007 from $114 million in 2006. The decline in residential mortgage banking revenues in 2007 as compared with 2006 resulted from lower realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights due to slimmer margins realized by the Company resulting from changes in market conditions. Residential mortgage banking revenues in 2006 were 7% higher than the $107 million earned in 2005. Higher revenue from servicing residential mortgage loans for others was the leading factor in the improvement.  

 Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $5.6 billion in 2007, compared with $6.4 billion in 2006 and $6.5 billion in 2005. Residential mortgage loans sold to investors totaled $5.3 billion in each of 2007 and 2005 and $5.0 billion in 2006. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $3 million in 2007, compared with $41 million in 2006 and $42 million in 2005. Changing market conditions that led to substantial reductions in investor demand for Alt-A residential mortgage loans resulted in an overall narrowing of margins realized from the sale of loans. That narrowing contributed significantly to the $38 million decline in revenues from 2006 to 2007 that was noted above. Also reflected in the 2007 results were $18 million of losses recognized in the first quarter specifically related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans. Unfavorable market conditions and a lack of market liquidity impacted the Companys willingness to sell Alt-A mortgage loans during the first quarter of 2007. As a result, the Company reclassified $883 million of Alt-A loans previously held for sale (including $808 million of first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage loans) to its held-for-investment loan portfolio during 2007s first quarter. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale must be recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans to held for investment, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by $12 million to reflect estimated market value. In addition, the Company is contractually obligated to repurchase some previously sold Alt-A loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria, including instances when mortgagors fail to make timely payments during the first 90 days subsequent to the sale date. As a result, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company accrued $6 million  

 58   
 to provide for declines in market value of previously sold Alt-A mortgage loans that the Company may be required to repurchase.  

 Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others rose to $73 million in 2007 from $66 million in 2006 and $58 million in 2005. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $21 million, $14 million and $10 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $19.4 billion at December 31, 2007, $16.7 billion a year earlier and $15.6 billion at December 31, 2005, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $4.9 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $170 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $153 million and $140 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $6 million, $10 million and $20 million at the 2007, 2006 and 2005 year-ends, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $57 million, $36 million and $23 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In addition, at December 31, 2007 capitalized servicing rights included $40 million for servicing rights for $4.6 billion of residential real estate loans that were purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is provided in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre-determined rates were $772 million and $492 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007, $1.8 billion and $680 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and $923 million and $352 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Net unrealized losses on hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $7 million and $5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2005, respectively, compared with net unrealized gains of $4 million at December 31, 2006. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net decreases in revenue of $23 million (including $12 million to record the Alt-A mortgage loans transferred from held for sale to held for investment at the lower of cost or market value) in 2007 and $8 million in 2005, and a net increase in revenue of $2 million in 2006.  

 Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $26 million in 2007 and $29 million in each of 2006 and 2005. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $13 million in 2007, compared with $15 million in 2006 and $14 million in 2005. Loan servicing revenues totaled $13 million in 2007, $14 million in 2006 and $15 million in 2005. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets totaled $20 million at December 31, 2007 and $21 million at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $5.3 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and included $1.0 billion, $939 million and $941 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $174 million and $97 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007, $115 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and $241 million and $42 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $79 million, $49 million and $199 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 Service charges on deposit accounts rose 7% to $409 million in 2007 from $381 million in 2006. Deposit account service charges in 2005 were $370 million. The higher levels of such revenues in 2007 and 2006 as compared with 2005 were largely due to consumer service charges related to overdraft fees and higher debit card transaction volumes.  

 Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income rose 8% to $153 million in  

 59   
 2007 from $141 million in 2006, due in part to the impact of higher balances in proprietary money-market mutual funds and higher revenues from providing personal trust and investment management services. Trust income totaled $135 million in 2005. Higher personal trust revenues contributed to the rise in revenues from 2005 to 2006. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, aggregated $146.1 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $142.4 billion at December 31, 2006. Trust assets under management were $15.5 billion and $14.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $10.5 billion and $8.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $60 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and was $56 million in 2005. The increase from 2005 to 2006 was due largely to increased revenues earned from the sale of annuities.  

 Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $30 million in 2007, $25 million in 2006 and $23 million in 2005. The improvement in 2007 as compared with 2006 reflected higher income related to interest rate swap agreements due to higher volumes of transactions executed on behalf of commercial customers. The higher gains in 2006 as compared with 2005 resulted largely from net increases in the market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $21 million in 2007 and $15 million in each of 2006 and 2005. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $47 million and $45 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of such assets were $4 million in 2007, $5 million in 2006 and $3 million in 2005. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations.  

 As previously described, an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $127 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007 in light of significant deterioration in the residential real estate market and the resulting decline in market value of the Companys collateralized debt obligations held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Reflecting that charge, losses on investment securities were $126 million in 2007, compared with gains of $3 million in 2006 and losses of $28 million during 2005. The losses in 2005 reflect the previously described $29 million charge for the other-than-temporary impairment in value of FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock. M&Ts pro-rata allocation of the operating results of BLG, in which it invested in during the first quarter of 2007 and that is recognized using the equity method of accounting, amounted to $9 million of revenue in 2007.  

 Other revenues from operations were $286 million in 2007, compared with $293 million in 2006 and $259 million in 2005. An $8 million increase in credit-related and corporate advisory fees in 2007 was more than offset by a $6 million decline in income from bank owned life insurance and the previously noted $13 million gain in 2006 from the call of an FHLB borrowing. Significant contributors to the 13% rise in other revenues from operations from 2005 to 2006 were the $13 million gain from the call of an FHLB borrowing and an increase of $9 million in insurance-related revenues, largely the result of the February 1, 2006 acquisition by M&T Bank of a commercial insurance and surety brokerage agency based in Maryland. Also contributing to the increase from 2005 to 2006 were higher income from educational lending services of $8 million and income from bank owned life insurance of $6 million.  

 Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees totaled $81 million, $77 million and $75 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $47 million in each of 2007 and 2005, and $53 million in 2006. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $35 million in 2007, $32 million in 2006 and $30 million in 2005. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $33 million in 2007, $32 million in 2006 and $22 million in  

 60   
 2005. The higher revenues in 2006 as compared with 2005 were primarily the result of the noted insurance agency acquisition in February 2006. Automated teller machine (ATM) usage fees aggregated $15 million in each of 2007 and 2006 and $22 million in 2005. The decrease in such fees from 2005 was largely the result of the reduction or elimination of fees charged for use of ATMs at certain non-branch locations.  

 Other Expense  

 Other expense aggregated $1.63 billion in 2007, compared with $1.55 billion in 2006 and $1.49 billion in 2005. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $66 million, $63 million and $57 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and merger-related integration expenses of $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. There were no merger-related expenses in 2005. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.55 billion in 2007, up 4% from $1.48 billion in 2006. Included in 2007s noninterest operating expenses was the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter related to the Visa litigation, while 2006s operating expenses reflected an $18 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation. The most significant contributor to the remaining increase in noninterest expense in 2007 was a higher level of salaries and employee benefits expense. The December 2007 acquisitions did not contribute significantly to noninterest operating expenses in 2007. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.43 billion in 2005. Excluding the charitable contribution in 2006, operating expenses in 2006 were less than 3% above those in 2005, due primarily to higher salaries costs, including merit pay increases and incentive compensation. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense.  

 Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $908 million in 2007, up 4% from $873 million in 2006. The most significant contributor to the increase was a higher level of salaries expense in 2007, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases and higher incentive compensation pay. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $822 million in 2005. The higher expense level for 2006 as compared with 2005 was due largely to salaries-related costs, including the impact of merit pay increases and higher stock-based compensation costs and other incentive pay. The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation using the fair value method of accounting for all stock-based compensation granted to employees after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense included stock-based compensation of $51 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and $45 million in 2005. The higher level of stock-based compensation in 2007 and 2006 as compared with 2005 was largely due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), effective January 1, 2006. As required, coincident with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a result, stock-based compensation expense during each of 2007 and 2006 included $4 million that would otherwise have been recognized over the normal four year vesting period if not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 123R. That acceleration had no effect on the value of stock-based compensation awarded to employees. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 13,246 at December 31, 2007 (including 648 from the December acquisition transactions), compared with 12,721 and 12,780 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $54 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and $59 million in 2005. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was $27 million in 2007, $28 million in 2006 and $38 million in 2005. Included in those amounts are $8 million in 2007 and $7 million in 2006 for a defined contribution pension plan that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current  

 61   
 economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment.  

 The Companys 2007 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long-term rate of return on assets of 8.00%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.70%; and a discount rate of 5.75%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $125 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $6 million in 2007, $8 million in 2006 and $5 million in 2005.  

 In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in 2006. As of December 31, 2007, the combined benefit obligations (as defined under SFAS No. 158) of the Companys defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $186 million. Of that amount, $66 million was related to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and $120 million related to non-qualified pension and other postretirement plans that are generally not funded until benefits are paid. Pursuant to the criteria of SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans that was at least equal to $186 million at December 31, 2007. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2007 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of $76 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby stockholders equity) by $46 million. The result of this was a year-over-year increase of $30 million to the required minimum postretirement benefit liability from the $46 million recorded at December 31, 2006. After applicable tax effect, the $30 million increase in the minimum required liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income in 2007 by an additional $18 million from the prior  

 62   
 year-end amount of $28 million. The $30 million increase to the liability was necessary to reflect losses that occurred during 2007 resulting from actual experience differing from assumptions and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The significant factors contributing to such losses were: migration to newer mortality tables in order to better reflect current life expectancy among plan participants and losses resulting from the qualified defined benefit plan asset return being lower than the expected return, partially offset by actuarial gains resulting from increasing the discount rate to 6.00% at December 31, 2007 from the 5.75% discount rate used at December 31, 2006. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2007 to 5.75% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans) of $25 million. Under that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment at December 31, 2007 would have been $101 million, rather than the $76 million that was actually recorded, and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 would have been $62 million, rather than the $46 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 6.25% would have decreased the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2007 would have been $52 million rather than the $76 million actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been $32 million rather than $46 million. The Company made contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2007 and 2006 of $66 million and $36 million, respectively. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a career-average-pay formula as opposed to the previous final-average-pay formula. The amendments affected benefits earned for service periods beginning after December 31, 2005. Active participants at that time had the choice of electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined contribution pension plan, the Company makes contributions to the plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual participants total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. New employees are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but do participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million as of December 31, 2005. Certain gains associated with the $98 million in pension benefit obligation reduction attributable to employees who remained in the plan are not subject to the ten percent corridor previously noted. Guidance contained in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, requires that these gains be amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining expected service period for active employees. Amortization of these gains had the effect of reducing the Companys pension expense for each of 2006 and 2007 by approximately $7 million.  

 In addition to the changes described above, the Company also amended its retirement savings plan (RSP), effective January 1, 2006, to allow for greater amounts of employee compensation to be eligible for contribution to the RSP. The RSP is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $22 million in 2007, $21 million in 2006 and $17 million in 2005.  

 As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined contribution pension plan, the Company hoped to limit increases in future period expenses associated with these plans. Reflecting the impact of these changes, expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $49 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and $55 million in 2005. Expense associated with providing medical and other postretirement benefits was $5 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and $4 million in 2005.  

 63   
 Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $639 million in 2007, up 5% from $611 million in 2006. The principal factors for that increase were the $23 million charge taken in 2007 related to the Visa litigation, the impact of net partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled $4 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006, and higher merchant and credit card costs and other real estate owned and foreclosure-related expenses, offset, in part, by the $18 million charitable contribution in 2006. As previously noted, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its IPO expected to occur in 2008. As part of that reorganization, M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of common stock of Visa, Inc. Those banks are also obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from certain Covered Litigation. Although Visa is expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the Covered Litigation, recent guidance from the SEC indicates that Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The Covered Litigation includes the following:  

       American Express litigationVisa announced in November 2007 that this litigation was settled.   

       Discover litigationVisa recorded an accrual related to this litigation in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, in September 2007, although the case was not settled as of December 31, 2007.   

       Interchange and Attridge litigation, and any other litigation that challenges Visas reorganization or the consummation thereof. The status of such initiated litigation as of December 31, 2007 was open with discovery incomplete.    

 Based on the facts and circumstances of each individual case as the Company understands them, a liability has been established by the Company in accordance with FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The estimation of the Companys proportionate share of any potential losses related to the Covered Litigation is extremely difficult and involves a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted share) related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in Visa, Inc.  

 Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $606 million in 2005. The increase from 2005 to 2006 reflects the $18 million charitable contribution made in 2006. Exclusive of the contribution, nonpersonnel operating expenses in 2006 decreased $13 million or 2% from 2005, due largely to lower costs for professional services, furniture and equipment.  

 Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes was $309 million in 2007, compared with $392 million in 2006 and $389 million in 2005. The effective tax rates were 32.1%, 31.9% and 33.2% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company adopted FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. That adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or on its results of operations during 2007. The decline in the Companys effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 reflects higher levels of income that were exempt from tax in certain jurisdictions and a $3 million favorable impact from settlement of refund claims originally filed by an entity subsequently acquired by M&T. The refunds received, consisting of income taxes and taxable interest, exceeded the amounts previously accrued for such items by $5 million (pre-tax).  

 The Companys effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change in income tax regulations within those jurisdictions, or interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

 International Activities  

 The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $120 million at December 31, 2007 and $185 million at December 31, 2006. Such assets included $107 million and $176 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $5.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2006. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable.  

 Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity  

 As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.  

 Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 54% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2007, compared with 57% at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005.  

 The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and others. At December 31, 2007, M&T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $8.2 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $6.5 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, 2007. The amounts of those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2007 or 2006. As an additional source of funding, M&T issued $300 million of senior notes in May 2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.375% and are due on May 24, 2012. The Company also obtains funding by maintaining a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $557 million of automobile loans and related assets that have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. That subsidiary, the loans and the borrowing are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As existing loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, have been used in the past to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or other subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. M&T Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes in December 2007. The notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in December 2017. In December 2006, M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes, which bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% for ten years and a floating rate thereafter, at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable at the Companys option after the fixed-rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory approval. Additional information about the Companys borrowings is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were $4.2 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In general, those borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business  

 65   
 day. As already noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally mature on the next business day and totaled $5.9 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was 12 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. Information regarding such deposits is included under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities.  

 The Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively affected should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 13. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.  

 Table 13  

 DEBT RATINGS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $63 million and $6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, the VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.7 billion. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

  (a)    The data do not include nonaccrual loans.   

 The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2007 are summarized in table 15. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2007 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

 Table 15  

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and common stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, approximately $296 million at December 31, 2007 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities and in the second quarter of 2007 by the issuance of $300 million of senior notes payable. Information regarding trust preferred securities, the related junior subordinated debentures and the senior notes is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2006.

  (b)    Maturities are reflected based upon contractual payments due. Actual maturities are expected to be significantly shorter as a result of loan repayments in the underlying mortgage pools.   

 Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either  

 69   
 currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.  

 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Companys core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $2.3 billion. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.

 WITH BALANCES OF $100,000 OR MORE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of  

 70   
 earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.  

 Table 18 displays as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.  

 Table 18  

 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income.  

 In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.

 Table 19  

 CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have also included forward and futures contracts related to mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities.  

 The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes aggregated $11.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2006. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $801 million and $613 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities were $281 million and $143 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and $137 million and $65 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $47 million and $45 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as  

 72   
 trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $50 million and $49 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income.  

 Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions associated with the Companys trading activities. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Capital  

 Stockholders equity at December 31, 2007 totaled $6.5 billion and represented 10.00% of total assets, compared with $6.3 billion or 11.01% at December 31, 2006 and $5.9 billion or 10.66% at December 31, 2005. On a per share basis, stockholders equity was $58.99 at December 31, 2007, up 4% from $56.94 at the 2006 year-end and 13% higher than $52.39 at December 31, 2005. Tangible equity per share was $27.98 at December 31, 2007, compared with $28.57 and $25.91 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is presented in table 2. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.67%, 10.82% and 10.71% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $59 million, or $.54 per common share, at December 31, 2007, compared with losses of $25 million, or $.23 per share, at December 31, 2006 and $49 million, or $.43 per share, at December 31, 2005. Such unrealized losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and/or a temporary lack of liquidity in the market, and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. Included in net unrealized losses on investment securities at December 31, 2007 were pre-tax unrealized losses of $58 million on privately issued mortgage-backed securities having a cost basis of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. As of that date, the Company believed it would receive all contractual principal and interest on such securities. The Company also had pre-tax net unrealized losses of $29 million on variable-rate preferred stock issuances of government-sponsored entities with a cost basis of $161 million at December 31, 2007. Substantially all of those unrealized losses occurred in late-2007. The Company concluded that as of December 31, 2007 the impairment of such securities was the result of the housing market downturn and its impact on those government-sponsored agencies, requiring the recapitalization of their balance sheets through the issuance of new, high yielding preferred stock in December 2007, and that it was too soon to conclude that such unrealized losses represented an other-than-temporary impairment. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had the ability and intent to hold each of its impaired securities to recovery. The Company intends to closely monitor the performance of the privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the preferred stock of the government-sponsored agencies, and other securities to assess if changes in their underlying credit performance or other events cause the cost basis of these securities to become other than temporarily impaired. However, because the unrealized losses described have already been reflected in the financial statement values for investment securities and stockholders equity, any recognition of an other-than-temporary decline in value of these investment securities would have no effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition.  

 Also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income is a gain of $1 million, representing the unamortized gain on the termination of an interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge that was entered into in anticipation of the Company issuing senior notes payable in the second  

 73   
 quarter of 2007. In addition, net unrealized fair value losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges were $10 million at December 31, 2007, representing approximately $.09 per share. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2006 or 2005.  

 The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to recognize additional minimum pension liability amounts pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87. Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as required under SFAS No. 158, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $46 million, or $.42 per share, at December 31, 2007 and $28 million, or $.26 per share, at December 31, 2006. Similar adjustments to recognize minimum pension liabilities as then required by SFAS No. 87, net of applicable tax effect, reduced stockholders equity by $49 million at December 31, 2005, or by $.44 per share. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Cash dividends paid in 2007 on M&Ts common stock totaled $282 million, compared with $250 million and $199 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the second quarter of 2005 from $.40 to $.45 per share, again in the second quarter of 2006 to $.60 per share, and to $.70 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Dividends per common share totaled $2.60 in 2007, up 16% from $2.25 in 2006 and 49% above $1.75 in 2005.  

 M&T repurchased 4,514,800 shares of its common stock in 2007, 3,259,000 shares in 2006 and 4,891,800 shares in 2005 at a cost of $509 million, $374 million and $510 million, respectively. In December 2004 and November 2005, M&T had announced plans to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. These repurchase plans were completed in December 2005 and March 2007, respectively. In February 2007, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2007, M&T had repurchased a total of 2,818,500 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $108.30 per share.  

 Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2007, core capital included $721 million of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $1.7 billion of subordinated notes. As previously noted, in December 2007, M&T Bank issued $400 million of 6.625% fixed rate subordinated notes due 2017. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. To further supplement its regulatory capital, in January 2008, M&T issued $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities that pay a fixed rate of interest of 8.50%.  

 The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 10.73% in 2007, 17.52% in 2006 and 18.50% in 2005.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net income totaled $65 million during the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $213 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were each $.60 in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $1.88 and $1.93, respectively, in the final quarter of 2006. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2007 were .42% and 4.05%, respectively, compared with 1.50% and 13.55%, respectively, in the year-earlier period.  

 Net operating income aggregated $84 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $225 million in the last quarter of 2006. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $.77 in the recently completed quarter, compared with $1.98 in the fourth quarter of 2006. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were .57% and 10.49%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with 1.67% and 28.71%, respectively, in the  

 74   
 corresponding 2006 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $10 million ($.09 per diluted share) and $11 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses associated with the Partners Trust and First Horizon acquisition transactions was $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of diluted earnings per share in the final 2007 quarter. There were no similar expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2007 and 2006 are provided in table 21.  

 The Companys fourth quarter results were adversely impacted by several notable items including the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to collateralized debt obligations, the $23 million accrual related to Covered Litigation of Visa, and $15 million of merger-related expenses associated with acquisitions completed in the quarter. Furthermore, the Company experienced significant loan growth during the second half and fourth quarter of 2007. Total loans, exclusive of loans obtained through the two acquisition transactions, increased $2.8 billion, or 6% (13% annualized), from June 30 to December 31, 2007, including growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans of $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, total loans, exclusive of loans obtained through the acquisitions, increased $1.8 billion, or 4% (16% annualized), including growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans of $1.6 billion. During the second half of 2007, lower real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs contributed to increased losses in the Companys portfolio of Alt-A residential mortgage loans. Declining real estate values also contributed to the recognition of additional losses on loans to two residential real estate builders and developers. Considering each of these factors, the Company increased the provision for credit losses to $101 million, or $48 million more than the $53 million of net charge-offs during the recent quarter.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 1% to $476 million in the last quarter of 2007 from $472 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth was the result of a 9% rise in average earning assets, that was substantially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $54.8 billion in the final quarter of 2007, compared with $50.2 billion in the year-earlier period. The acquisitions completed in 2007s final quarter added approximately $1.1 billion to average earning assets for the quarter, including $742 million of average loans. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $46.1 billion, up 8% from $42.5 billion during the final quarter of 2006. Increases of $1.0 billion in each of commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans, a $790 million rise in residential real estate loans, and a $795 million increase in consumer loans represented the growth in average loans outstanding. The yield on earning assets was 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2007, down 27 basis points from 6.92% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.75% in the last quarter of 2007, 8 basis points lower than 3.83% in the corresponding period in 2006. The resulting net interest spread was 2.90% in the recent quarter, down 19 basis points from 3.09% in the fourth quarter of 2006. That decline was attributable to several factors, including significantly higher loan balances funded partially by wholesale borrowings, higher levels of investment securities and other earning assets that generally yield less than loans, lower commercial real estate loan prepayment fees, reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans including the effect of the change in accounting practice for past-due residential real estate loans, and the impact of the two acquisition transactions. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the Companys net interest margin was .55% in the final 2007 quarter, down from .64% in the year-earlier quarter. That decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution and a lower balance of interest-free funds. As a result, the Companys net interest margin narrowed to 3.45% in the recent quarter from 3.73% in the last quarter of 2006.  

 As noted above, the provision for credit losses rose to $101 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2007 from $28 million in the year-earlier period. The higher level of the provision reflects changes in the loan portfolio, the impact of declining residential real estate valuations and higher delinquencies and charge-offs related to the Alt-A residential real estate loan portfolio, and declining real estate values related to residential real estate builder and developer loan collateral. Net charge-offs of loans were $53 million in 2007s fourth quarter, representing an annualized .46% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $24 million or .23% during the final three months of 2006. The impact of the recent quarters change in accounting procedure for charging-off residential real estate  

 75   
 loans when they become 150 days delinquent from the previous policy of waiting until foreclosure of the underlying property was $15 million. If not for that change, charge-offs would have been $38 million or an annualized .33% of average outstanding loans in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase from the year-earlier period was due, in part, to higher charge-offs of Alt-A loans.  

 Other income totaled $160 million in the last quarter of 2007, down 37% from $256 million in the year-earlier quarter. That decline resulted from the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in the recent quarter related to collateralized debt obligations held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding that charge, other income was $288 million, up 12% from the year-earlier quarter. That improvement was due to higher service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains, and $15 million related to M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG.  

 Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to $445 million from $384 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million and $19 million in the final quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $415 million in the recently completed quarter, up 14% from $365 million in the last three months of 2006. Higher costs for salaries and benefits, including the impact of the acquisitions completed in the recent quarter, and the Visa litigation charge were the leading contributors to that rise in operating expense. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006 was 54.3% and 50.2%, respectively. Table 21 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2007 and 2006.  

 Segment Information  

 In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking, and Retail Banking. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company began reporting its Business Banking strategic business unit as a separate reportable segment. Prior to that date, that unit was included in the Retail Banking reportable segment. Prior year information has been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments.  

 The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services to small businesses and professionals through the Companys branch network, business banking centers and other delivery channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and automated teller machines within markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include various business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. Net income for the Business Banking segment totaled $133 million in 2007, up 3% from the $128 million earned in 2006. The improvement from a year earlier was largely the result of a $15 million increase in net interest income, attributable to a 38 basis point widening of the deposit net interest margin, and higher service charges on deposit accounts of $3 million. Those factors were partially offset by $4 million increases in each of personnel costs and the provision for credit losses. The Business  

 76   
 Banking segments net income was $115 million in 2005. The most significant contributor to the improvement from 2005 to 2006 was a $35 million increase in net interest income, largely due to an 87 basis point widening of the deposit net interest margin. Partially offsetting that increase were higher noninterest expenses of $7 million, mainly the result of higher personnel costs, and a $6 million increase in the provision for credit losses due to higher net charge-offs of loans.  

 The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segments net income increased 2% to $231 million in 2007 from $226 million in 2006. Contributing to that improvement was higher net interest income of $11 million, attributable to a $953 million increase in average loan balances outstanding offset, in part, by a 32 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, and increases in fees received for providing corporate advisory and loan syndication services of $4 million each. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a $7 million rise in the provision for credit losses, largely attributable to loan growth, and higher personnel costs of $5 million. Net income earned by the Commercial Banking segment was $219 million in 2005. The improvement in 2006 as compared with 2005 was primarily the result of a $25 million rise in net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses, most significantly personnel costs that were up $7 million. The higher net interest income was predominantly due to a widening of the net interest margin and an 8% increase in average loan balances outstanding, offset, in part, by the impact of a 17% decrease in average demand deposit balances.  

 The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. The Commercial Real Estate segment recorded net income of $135 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. When comparing 2007s results with 2006, a rise in net interest income of $6 million was offset by a higher provision for credit losses of $4 million and a $2 million increase in personnel costs. The higher net interest income resulted from a $426 million increase in average loan balances outstanding, net of a 10 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin associated with such balances. This segment contributed net income of $143 million in 2005. The decline in 2006s net income as compared with 2005 was the result of an $8 million decrease in net interest income, predominantly due to a narrowing of net interest margin on loans outstanding, higher noninterest expenses of $6 million and lower commercial mortgage credit-related fees and other revenues of $4 million.  

 The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the collateralized debt obligations and preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC owned by the Company. In March 2007, the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans to this segments held-for-investment loan portfolio. Such loans were previously included in loans held for sale in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Discretionary Portfolio segment incurred a net loss of $7 million in 2007, compared with net income of $96 million in 2006. The main factor resulting in the unfavorable performance in 2007 was the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to collateralized debt obligations backed by sub-prime residential mortgage securities. As previously discussed, the impairment charge was recognized in light of significant deterioration in the residential real estate market and the resulting decline in market value of the debt obligations. Also contributing to the decline in this segments results when compared with 2006 was a $26 million increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily resulting from increased loan balances and higher net charge-offs of Alt-A mortgage loans, and the $13 million gain recognized in 2006 resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB  

 77   
 borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. The Discretionary Portfolio segments net income in 2006 was 3% above the $93 million earned in 2005. Contributing to the improvement was the $29 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to the preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC reflected in 2005s results and the previously mentioned $13 million FHLB gain in 2006. Partially offsetting the favorable impact of those factors was a $39 million decrease in net interest income, resulting from a 58 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on investment securities and a $470 million decline in the average balance of the segments portfolio of investment securities.  

 The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the southern and western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. As already noted, in the first quarter of 2007, $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans previously included in this segments held-for-sale portfolio, were transferred to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segments net income declined 74% to $13 million in 2007 from $52 million in 2006. That decline was primarily due to the significant deterioration of the residential real estate market during 2007, which resulted in a $36 million drop in residential mortgage banking revenues earned by this segment. Contributing to the lower mortgage banking revenues were lower gains from residential mortgage loan origination and sales activities of $28 million, predominantly resulting from slimmer margins realized due to changes in market conditions, and the $12 million of losses recognized in the first quarter of 2007 related to the Alt-A loans transferred to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. Additionally, due to requests from investors for the Company to repurchase residential real estate loans previously sold, the Company reduced mortgage banking revenues by $6 million in the first quarter of 2007 to reflect declines in market values of some loans that the Company may be required to repurchase. Also contributing to the unfavorable performance as compared with 2006 was a $19 million decrease in net interest income, largely due to a $451 million decline in average loan balances outstanding and a 25 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on such loans, and reversals of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, which totaled $4 million and $10 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were higher mortgage servicing revenues of $10 million. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment contributed net income of $43 million in 2005. The improved performance in 2006 over 2005 was predominantly due to an 11% increase in noninterest revenues resulting from higher income from servicing mortgage loans of $10 million and increased gains from the sales of loans to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of $9 million. Also contributing to the improvement was an $8 million increase in net interest income, mainly due to a 30% increase in balances of loans held for sale, net of a 52 basis point decline in net interest margin associated with such loan balances. Partially offsetting these favorable factors were higher personnel costs of $8 million and other noninterest expenses of $4 million. Included in noninterest expenses for 2005 was a partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $8 million.  

 The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers through several delivery channels which include branch offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), and home equity loans and lines of credit. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Retail Banking segment contributed net income of $316 million, compared with $282 million in 2006. The 12% improvement resulted from a $60 million increase in net interest income, primarily the result of a 30 basis point increase in the deposit net interest margin, and higher service charges on deposit accounts of $25 million. Partially offsetting those factors was a $20 million increase in the  

 78   
 provision for credit losses resulting from higher average loan balances outstanding and net charge-offs and a $4 million increase in other noninterest expenses, largely due to higher processing costs related to debit card transactions. Net income for the Retail Banking segment aggregated $210 million in 2005. The improved performance in 2006 as compared with 2005 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $84 million, largely resulting from a widening of the net interest margin on deposit products. Also contributing to the improvement were higher service charges on deposit accounts of $17 million, and declines of $9 million in each of the provision for credit losses and in other noninterest expenses.  

 The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions, M&Ts equity in the earnings of BLG; merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions and the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $167 million, $80 million and $41 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The higher net loss experienced in 2007 resulted from the impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses; the previously discussed $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter related to Visa litigation; increases in personnel and professional services costs of $19 million and $12 million, respectively, related to the business and support units included in the All Other category; $15 million of merger-related expenses in 2007 associated with the fourth quarter acquisition transactions, compared with $5 million in 2006 for that years June branch acquisition; a $4 million reduction of net income resulting from M&Ts investment in BLG (inclusive of interest expense to fund that investment); and a higher charge for the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The $18 million charitable contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation in 2006 partially offset those unfavorable factors. The higher net loss incurred during 2006 as compared with 2005 was primarily the result of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments. Also contributing to the net loss were the previously mentioned $18 million charitable contribution and higher charges for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses incurred as a result of the June 2006 branch acquisition of $6 million and $5 million, respectively.  

 Recent Accounting Developments  

 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The definition of fair value is clarified by SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. The disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of the measurements on earnings for the period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The provisions generally should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which SFAS No. 157 is applied, with certain provisions required to be applied retrospectively. Many of the Companys assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions are required to either be accounted for or disclosed using fair value as their relevant measurement attribute. The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. That adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and other items at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing entities  

 79   
 with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. After adopting SFAS No. 159, an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may generally be applied on an instrument by instrument basis and is an irrevocable election. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 generally permits prospective application to eligible items existing at the effective date. The Company has not made any fair value elections as of January 1, 2008.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS No. 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control. SFAS No. 141R retains the guidance in SFAS No. 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. With limited exceptions, the statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair value as of that date. That replaces SFAS No. 141s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. As a result, certain acquisition-related costs previously included in the cost of an acquisition will be required to be expensed as incurred. In addition, certain restructuring costs previously recognized as if they were an assumed liability from an acquisition, will be required to be expensed. SFAS No. 141R also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. SFAS No. 141R also requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values. An acquirer is required to recognize assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies (noncontractual contingencies) as of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values, only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements. The statement requires the acquirer to recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as a residual, which in most types of business combinations will result in measuring goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. SFAS No. 141R also eliminates the recognition of a separate valuation allowance as of the acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the fair value measurement. SFAS No. 141R should be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is still evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 141R, but believes that its adoption will significantly impact its accounting for any acquisitions it may consummate in 2009 and beyond.  

 Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. A noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is a portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. SFAS No. 160 requires that the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest is required to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 160 also requires entities to provide disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of a fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company does not anticipate that the  

 80   
 adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a significant impact to its reporting of its financial condition or results of its operations.  

 In November 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109, which reverses previous conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings under GAAP. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the fair value measurement of the derivative loan commitment. The expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan that are included in the fair value measurement of a derivative loan commitment or a written loan commitment should be determined in the same manner that the fair value of a recognized servicing asset or liability is measured under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended by SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets. The SEC staff expects registrants to apply the accounting described in SAB No. 109 for loan commitments accounted for as derivatives that are issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. In accordance with the new guidance, the Company has adopted the provisions of SAB No. 109 effective January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the value ascribed to the previously excluded cash flows related to associated servicing of the loans was approximately $5 million. In accordance with SAB No. 105, the Company has not included this amount in the value of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives at December 31, 2007. Rather, recognition of such value will be deferred until the loans are actually sold or securitized. Had SAB No. 109 been in effect during 2007, such amounts would have been recognized in mortgage banking revenues in 2007. As a result of adopting SAB No. 109 on January 1, 2008, the Company expects that there will be an acceleration of the recognition of mortgage banking revenues to reflect the value ascribed to the associated servicing of the loans for all new or modified loan commitments accounted for as derivatives in the first quarter of 2008.  

 The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a final consensus on Issue 06-04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements and on Issue 06-10, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, at its September 2006 and March 2007 meetings, respectively. The EITF consensus for each issue stipulates that an agreement by an employer to share a portion of the proceeds of a life insurance policy with an employee during the postretirement period is a postretirement benefit arrangement required to be accounted for under SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, or Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 12, Omnibus Opinion  1967. Each consensus concludes that the purchase of a split-dollar life insurance policy does not constitute a settlement under SFAS No. 106 and, therefore, a liability for the postretirement obligation must be recognized under SFAS No. 106 if the benefit is offered under an arrangement that constitutes a plan or under APB No. 12 if it is not part of a plan. Issue 06-04 and Issue 06-10 are effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2007. The provisions of both Issue 06-04 and Issue 06-10 should be applied through either a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or retrospective application. The Company has endorsement and collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance policies that it inherited through certain acquisitions that are associated with individuals who are no longer active employees. The adoption of the provisions of Issue 06-04 and Issue 06-10 on January 1, 2008 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict.
