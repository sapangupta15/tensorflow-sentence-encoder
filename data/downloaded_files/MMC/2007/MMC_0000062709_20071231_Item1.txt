OUR BUSINESSES  

Risk and Insurance Services  

Risk and Insurance Services, comprising Marsh and Guy Carpenter, is MMCs largest business segment. This segment generated 49% of MMCs total operating segments revenue in 2007 and employs approximately 29,000 colleagues worldwide. This segment also includes Marsh & McLennan Risk Capital Holdings.  

Marsh  

Marsh generated 40% of MMCs total operating segments revenue in 2007. Operating through a global network of approximately 400 offices in over 100 countries, Marsh is a world leader in delivering risk and insurance services and solutions. More than 26,000 Marsh colleagues provide risk management, insurance broking, consulting and insurance program management services to a wide range of businesses, government entities and professional service organizations around the world. Marshs clients vary by size, industry, geography and risk exposure.  

Client Relationships. In its main risk consulting and insurance broking practice, Marsh employs a team approach to address its clients individual risk management and insurance needs. Each client relationship is coordinated by a client executive who assembles the resources needed to analyze, measure and manage the clients various risks. The client executive draws from colleagues who specialize in specific industries (e.g., financial services, telecom, life sciences, health care, construction, transportation) and/or risk specialty areas (e.g., property, casualty, workers compensation, environmental, political risk, financial and professional liability).  

Risk Analysis. Marshs risk and insurance professionals identify, analyze and estimate risks that arise from client operations and assets. These client risks may relate to physical damage to property, various liability exposures, and other factors that could result in financial loss, as well as large and complex risks that require access to world insurance and financial markets. Marsh professionals address traditional property and liability risks and a widening range of financial, strategic and operating exposures, including those relating to employment practices, the development and operation of technology resources, intellectual property, the remediation of environmental pollution, mergers and acquisitions, the interruption of revenue streams derived from leasing and credit operations and political risks.  

Risk Advice and Consulting. Marsh professionals use a risk-based approach to help clients identify critical functions of their businesses, analyze exposures and evaluate existing risk treatment practices and strategies. Marsh advises clients in structuring programs for retaining, mitigating, financing, and transferring risk in combinations that vary according to the clients particular needs and circumstances. In addition to placing insurance, Marsh might help a client develop risk management strategies that include loss-control services (such as business continuity planning, ergonomic and workplace safety programs and loss information management), or alternative risk financing (such as the securitization of risk, the placement of risk with the capital markets and self-insured programs). Marshs professionals help clients implement their risk management and mitigation strategies by negotiating and executing transactions with the worldwide insurance and capital markets, establishing and managing specialized insurance companies owned by clients (sometimes known as captive insurance companies) and implementing various loss-control programs.  

Global Consumer Practice. In addition to its main risk management and broking practice described above, Marsh operates a global consumer practice that provides advice, broking, intermediary and program management services to corporate and association clients globally and to individual and small business clients primarily in the United States. Marsh professionals in this practice design, market and administer a variety of insurance and insurance-related products and services, such as consumer property and casualty programs and life insurance, purchased by an associations or professional groups members or provided to employees of corporate clients as part of a voluntary

 payroll deduction program. Other areas of the consumer practice include: private client services, which provides specialized risk and insurance programs to high-net-worth individuals and family offices; Marsh financial services, which offers key-person and executive benefit programs, as well as planning and wealth preservation solutions to affluent individuals; and a small commercial practice, which offers standardized insurance programs to small businesses and franchise operations.  

Support Services. Marsh subsidiaries also provide insurance support services such as claims collection, claims advocacy, injury management, claims administration, and other insurance- and risk- related services. Marsh provides technological support to risk management professionals and the property & casualty industry by delivering integrated software and services that support risk management, claims, administration, compliance management, bill review and data management.  

Subsidiaries in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, under various names apart from Marsh, provide underwriting management services to insurers in the United States and Canada, primarily for professional liability coverages.

Run-off services and other reinsurance and insurance administration solutions are offered through Guy Carpenter affiliates on a fee basis.  

Acting as a broker or intermediary on all classes of reinsurance, Guy Carpenter places two main types of property and casualty reinsurance: treaty reinsurance, which involves the transfer of a portfolio of risks; and facultative reinsurance, which entails the transfer of part or all of the coverage provided by a single insurance policy.  

Guy Carpenter also provides reinsurance services in a broad range of specialty practice areas, including accident and health, agriculture, alternative risk transfer, environmental, general casualty, investment banking, life and annuity, marine and energy, professional liability, program manager solutions, property, retrocessional reinsurance (reinsurance between reinsurers), structured risk, surety, terror risk, and workers compensation. In addition, Guy Carpenter provides its clients with numerous reinsurance-related services, such as actuarial, enterprise risk management, financial and regulatory consulting and portfolio analysis. Guy Carpenters Instrat® unit delivers advanced risk assessment analytics, catastrophe modeling and exposure management tools to assist clients in the reinsurance decision-making process.  

Guy Carpenter offers run-off services for inactive clients in North America and elsewhere through Reinsurance Solutions LLC and Reinsurance Solutions Limited, respectively. These affiliates also offer reinsurance and insurance administration solutions on a fee basis.  

Marsh & McLennan Risk Capital Holdings  

MMC owns investments in private equity funds and insurance and financial services firms through its subsidiary Marsh & McLennan Risk Capital Holdings (Risk Capital Holdings). Risk Capital Holdings generated 1% of MMCs total operating segments revenue in 2007.  

Compensation for Services in Risk and Insurance Services  

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. For billing and other administrative services, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others.

For a more detailed discussion of revenue sources and factors affecting revenue in our Risk Consulting & Technology segment, see Part II, Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of this report.  

Regulation  

MMCs activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under United States federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which MMCs subsidiaries operate. See Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses.  

Risk and Insurance Services. While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers, managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license   

7  

Table of Contents 

 from a governmental agency or self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in this case, if MMC has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction.  

Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive. This Directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance. As member states of the European Union adopt regulations to comply with the Directive, our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union have become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the United Kingdom.  

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which MMCs subsidiaries do business, including the FSA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.  

Certain of MMCs risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., a US-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of Interlink Securities Corp., primarily in connection with variable insurance products. Guy Carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the European Union through GC Securities Ltd., authorized and regulated by the FSA. MMC Securities Corp., Interlink Securities Corp. and GC Securities Ltd. are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of MMC.  

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker customarily looks to the client for payment.  

Consulting. Certain of Mercers retirement-related consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. In the United States, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group use the services of MMC Securities Corp. primarily in connection with the sale of retirement and employee benefit plans, and investment banking services, respectively.  

Risk Consulting & Technology. Certain of Krolls risk consulting and investigative activities are licensed and regulated at the federal, state and local level in the United States and abroad. Many of these activities also involve the use of data from outside sources, including third party vendors and governmental records. As a result, changes in existing, or the implementation of new, laws and regulations, particularly relating to privacy, could interfere with Krolls historical access to and use of such data. Substance abuse testing laboratories operated by a Kroll subsidiary are certified on the federal level and licensed in a number of states.

Competitive Conditions  

MMC faces strong competition in all of its business segments from providers of similar products and services. MMC also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see Risks Relating to MMC Generally  Competitive Risks, in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  

Risk and Insurance Services. MMCs combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. MMC encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services business from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products. Although the major global insurance brokerage firms against whom Marsh competes have, like us, stopped using market service arrangements, many specialist, regional and local firms have not done so. The continuing acceptance of market service or contingent commission revenue by certain of Marshs competitors may provide them greater pricing flexibility and put Marsh at a competitive disadvantage.  

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. There are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.  

The continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect Marshs competitive position. These proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report. Please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) below.  

Consulting. MMCs consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.  

Mercers investment consulting business faces competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions. Mercers investment management business, which was recently established, in particular faces significant competition from better-established rivals with greater experience in that market.  

In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer internally, without assistance from outside advisors.  

Risk Consulting & Technology. In risk consulting and technology, we face competition from local, regional, national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting, corporate advisory and restructuring services, investigative and security services, consulting and technology services. Krolls Consulting Services Group faces competition from local, regional, national and international accounting firms and forensic accounting, litigation support, investigative and other specialist and consulting firms. Krolls Corporate Advisory & Restructuring Group faces competition from national and international accounting firms and specialist recovery firms. Krolls Security Group faces competition from international and local security firms, government security contractors, and architectural engineering firms. Krolls Technology Services Group faces competition from a variety of law firms, independent service providers and technology companies.
