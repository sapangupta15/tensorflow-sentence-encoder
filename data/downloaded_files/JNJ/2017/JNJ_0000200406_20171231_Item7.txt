Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Organization and Business Segments

Description of the Company and Business Segments

Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.

The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. 

 The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.

In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.

Management’s Objectives 

With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. 

The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2017 sales. In 2017, $10.6 billion was invested in research and development and $35.2 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. 

A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 134,000 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

Analysis of Consolidated Sales

In 2017, worldwide sales increased 6.3% to $76.5 billion, compared to an increase of 2.6% in 2016 and a decrease of 5.7% in 2015. These sales changes consisted of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2017, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a positive impact of 3.6%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative impact of 1.1% on the worldwide sales growth and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 0.8% on the worldwide sales growth. Operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the worldwide sales growth 0.3%. In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was negative 2.0%. 

Sales by U.S. companies were $39.9 billion in 2017, $37.8 billion in 2016 and $35.7 billion in 2015. This represents increases of 5.4% in 2017, 6.0% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. Sales by international companies were $36.6 billion in 2017, $34.1 billion in 2016 and $34.4 billion in 2015. This represents an increase of 7.4% in 2017, and decreases of 0.9% in 2016, and 13.1% in 2015.

The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 6.0% and (0.4)%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.3%, 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively.

In 2017, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 8.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 7.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.4%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 5.4% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 2.8% and a positive currency impact of 2.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 6.7% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 7.5% partially offset by a negative currency impact of 0.8%.

The 2016 sales growth percentage as compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by approximately 1.3% from additional shipping days in 2015. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week in 2015 added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.

 In 2017, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0% and 10.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2016, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 13.5% and 10.7% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2015, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% of the total consolidated revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 The Beauty franchise sales of $4.2 billion increased 7.8% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the inclusion of sales from the recent acquisitions, Vogue International LLC and Dr. Ci: Labo, as well as sales growth of NEUTROGENA® products. 

The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.1 billion increased 3.7% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by analgesic products in the U.S., upper respiratory products outside the U.S., sales from the recent acquisition of Rhinocort and anti-smoking aids. 

 The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of 4.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to competitive pressure.

The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2017, a decrease of 2.4% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by category declines and competitive pressure partially offset by new product launches outside the U.S. 

The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.1 billion in 2017, a decrease of 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to category declines in EMEA and share loss in Brazil.

The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.8 billion in 2017, a decrease of 2.3% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to private label competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by BAND-AID® new product launches outside the U.S.

Immunology products achieved sales of $12.2 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 2.3% as compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab), the launch of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) and sales growth of SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) were due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. 

The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. The Company continues to assert REMICADE® related patent rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. 

Infectious disease products sales were $3.2 billion, a decline of 1.7% from 2016. Lower sales of OLYSIO® (simeprevir), vaccines and PREZISTA® (darunavir/cobicistat) were partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT®/rilpivirine, PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® and the launch of SYMTUZA®. 

Neuroscience products sales were $6.0 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from 2016. Lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and CONCERTA®/methylphenidate as well as the impact of divestitures were partially offset by strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/ TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) long-acting injectables. 

Oncology products achieved sales of $7.3 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 25.0% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth of Oncology products were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) and IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) driven by market share and market growth and sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by market growth. Several generic companies are challenging the remaining patent for ZYTIGA® in the USPTO and in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company is appealing a decision by the USPTO invalidating this patent, and the parties are awaiting a decision on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by the generic companies. In the event that the rulings are unfavorable to the Company, a generic launch is expected to follow. If there is a launch of a generic version of ZYTIGA® following FDA approval, it will result in a reduction in U.S. sales, and such reduction could occur in a short period of time. In 2017, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.2 billion for ZYTIGA®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA®.

 Pulmonary Hypertension is a new therapeutic area which was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition. 

Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $6.3 billion, a decline of 1.7% as compared to the prior year attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. primarily due to an increase in price discounts and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. This was partially offset by sales growth of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) due to increased market growth and market share, as well as sales of non-PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) products from the Actelion acquisition. 

 19 

During 2017, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2016 were $33.5 billion, an increase of 6.5% from 2015, which included operational growth of 7.4% partially offset by a negative currency impact of 0.9%. U.S. sales were $20.1 billion, an increase of 9.8%. International sales were $13.3 billion, an increase of 1.8%, which included 4.0% operational growth partially offset by a negative currency impact of 2.2%. In 2016, acquisitions, divestitures and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.5% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 1.5% due to additional shipping days in 2015. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth for 2016, as compared to the prior year, was not impacted by adjustments to previous reserve estimates as both periods included approximately $0.5 billion of adjustments. 

 20 

Medical Devices Segment

The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016. 

Major Medical Devices Franchise Sales:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Products acquired from Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) on February 27, 2017 

** On June 30, 2014, the Company divested the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business (the Diagnostics Franchise)

The Surgery franchise sales were $9.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 2.8% from 2016. Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, energy, including the acquisition of Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., and biosurgery products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by sutures and sales from the acquisition of Torax Medical, Inc. The sales decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily due to lower sales of aesthetic, Advanced Sterilization and Sterilmed products. 

The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.8% from 2016. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture, share loss in U.S. Spine, pricing and competitive pressures. This was partially offset by sales growth of trauma, sports medicine products and U.S. hips.

The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $4.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 45.9% from 2016. Growth was driven by sales from the acquisition of AMO, with the majority of AMO sales in the surgical category, and new product launches in the contact lenses category.

The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 13.4% from 2016. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® Contact Force Sensing Catheter. 

The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9.7% from 2016. The decline was primarily due to price declines and competitive pressures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced its decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business. Animas has selected Medtronic plc to facilitate a seamless transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. The Company is continuing to evaluate potential strategic options for LifeScan, Inc. and determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value.

The Medical Devices segment sales in 2016 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 0.1% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.0%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, an increase of 1.1% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $12.9 billion, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative 

 21 

impact of 1.8% on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2015. In 2016, the Medical Devices segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 0.9% due to additional shipping days in 2015.

Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income

Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $17.7 billion in 2017, as compared to $19.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of 10.8%. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense and other charges related to recent acquisitions, higher selling, marketing and administrative costs due to investments in new product launches and higher research and development costs due to general portfolio progression and collaborations. 

Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $19.8 billion in 2016, as compared to $19.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 3.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs. This was partially offset by higher net litigation expense of $0.7 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to 2016. 

As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2017 was 23.1% versus 27.5% in 2016.

Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:  Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.2% from 30.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix. 

In 2016, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 30.2% from 30.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Favorable mix in the business and cost improvement programs was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency. Intangible asset amortization expense of $1.2 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2016 and 2015. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost management in all the segments and favorable mix. 

Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* As a percent to segment sales

Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 16.0% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. In 2016, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 0.5% compared to 

 22 

2015 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was attributable to higher overall sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. The increased dollar spend in the Pharmaceutical segment was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. 

In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. In 2015, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. 

Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. 

The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2016 was an unfavorable change of $2.5 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses in the fiscal year 2015 as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® and the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, the fiscal year of 2016 included higher litigation expense of $0.7 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included in the fiscal year 2015.

Interest (Income) Expense:  Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired.

Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program.

Interest income in 2016 increased by $0.2 billion as compared to 2015 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.9 billion at the end of 2016, and averaged $40.1 billion as compared to the $35.7 billion average cash balance in 2015. 

Interest expense in 2016 was higher as compared to 2015. The average debt balance was $23.5 billion in 2016 versus $19.3 billion in 2015. The total debt balance at the end of 2016 was $27.1 billion as compared to $19.9 billion at the end of 2015. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.2 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.

(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. 

Increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher interest expense of $0.2 billion on higher debt balance.

Consumer Segment: In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED® in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. 

 In 2016, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.3%, versus 13.2% in 2015, primarily driven by favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins from cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher gains in 2015 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the Consumer segment income before tax in 2016 as compared to 2015. 

Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. 

In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 38.3% versus 37.3% in 2015. The increase in income before tax was primarily due to strong sales volume growth and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015, had higher gains of $0.7 billion related to divestitures partially offset by a higher IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included the gains from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business and certain anesthetic products in Europe versus the gains recorded in 2015 from the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®. 

Medical Devices Segment: In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery.

In 2016, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 22.2% versus 27.2% in 2015. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to lower gains of $1.4 billion related to divestitures, higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent in 2015 and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016.

Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The restructuring actions are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018. Approximately $500 million in savings were realized in 2017. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion. In 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $760 million, of which $88 million is included in cost of products sold and $363 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $685 million, of which $45 million is included in cost of products sold and $149 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81 million was included in cost of products sold. Restructuring related charges of $2.0 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.

Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 92.6% in 2017, 16.5% in 2016 and 19.7% in 2015. The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA. 

 The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin pump business. 

The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if enacted into law.

The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate, as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company adopting a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. 

The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity & Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents were $17.8 billion at the end of 2017 as compared to $19.0 billion at the end of 2016. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $1.2 billion decrease were approximately $21.1 billion of cash generated from operating activities and $0.3 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents offset by $14.9 billion net cash used by investing activities and $7.7 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $0.5 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2017 and $22.9 billion at the end of 2016. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Cash flow from operations of $21.1 billion was the result of $1.3 billion of net earnings and $9.8 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs and deferred tax provision, reduced by $1.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses and $1.0 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in other current and non-current assets. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $12.3 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease in inventories and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. The increase in accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2017 U.S. tax legislation (TCJA). The U.S. tax of $10.1 billion is payable over 8 years. Additionally, foreign taxes of $3.4 billion, net were recorded in the deferred tax provision. 

Investing activities use of $14.9 billion was for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $35.2 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Actelion and AMO for approximately $29.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively) and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion. This was partially offset by proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $22.0 billion and $1.8 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestitures of Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED®). 

Financing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.9 billion, $6.4 billion for the repurchase of common stock and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $6.8 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.1 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.

On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of July 2, 2017, $10.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. 

 25 

As of December 31, 2017, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In 2017, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. In the fiscal first and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company issued bonds for a total of $9.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financing and Market Risk

The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $167 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $197 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.

The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $69 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.

The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.

The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. 

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2017, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 13, 2018. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.

Total borrowings at the end of 2017 and 2016 were $34.6 billion and $27.1 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2017 and 2016 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program and general corporate purposes. In 2017, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $16.3 billion compared to net cash of $14.8 billion in 2016. Total debt represented 36.5% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2017 and 27.8% of total capital in 2016. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2017 was $22.43 compared to $26.02 at year-end 2016, a decrease of 13.8%.

A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 31, 2017 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):

Dividends

The Company increased its dividend in 2017 for the 55th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.32 per share in 2017 compared with dividends of $3.15 per share in 2016, and $2.95 per share in 2015. The dividends were distributed as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On January 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.84 per share, payable on March 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2018. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.

Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which will be adopted in 2018.

Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.

Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.

Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were approximately 1% or less of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.

In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.

Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 

 28 

Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. The Company has provisionally booked a $10.1 billion charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. Additionally, the Company has provisionally recorded a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all undistributed foreign earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which it has not provided deferred taxes for foreign local and withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material. 

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.

Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. 

The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.

See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.

 30 

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.

Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.

Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2017.

Economic and Market Factors

The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2007 - 2017, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 31, 2017, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2017 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $360 million and income by $105 million.

Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. 

 31 

The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.

Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.

The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal Proceedings

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.

In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.

See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.
