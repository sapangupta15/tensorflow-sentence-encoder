MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Overview 

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our core operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC and Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 47.6% interest in Americold Realty Trust (Americold), which owns and operates 90 cold storage warehouses nationwide, a 32.8% interest in Alexanders Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, and a 32.7% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, as well as other real estate and related investments. 

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are effective rents, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 

Our ultimate business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. The table below compares our total return performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) for the following periods ending December 31, 2007 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Beginning in the second half of 2007, the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages and declining residential housing prices nationwide. This credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit markets and has generally reduced the availability of financing and widened spreads. These factors, coupled with a slowing economy, may negatively impact the volume of real estate transactions and cap rates, which would negatively impact stock price performance of public real estate companies, including ours. Our one-year total return to shareholders for the period ending December 31, 2007 was negative 25.5% and the RMS total return for the same period was negative 16.8%. Although our core operating results were not negatively impacted by these conditions in 2007, if these conditions persist in 2008 and beyond, our real estate portfolio may experience lower occupancy and effective rents which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flows. In addition, the value of our investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and mezzanine loans may also decline as a result of the above factors. Such declines may result in impairment charges and/or valuation allowances which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations.  

We intend to achieve our ultimate business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

   

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;    

   

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation;    

   

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;    

   

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;    

   

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component;    

   

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and     

 

 Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies.

Acquisitions and Investments 

During 2007, we completed $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 33 separate transactions, consisting of an aggregate of $3,024,600,000 in cash, $958,700,000 in existing mortgage debt and $62,100,000 in common and preferred Operating Partnership units. Details of the significant transactions are summarized below.  

100 West 33rd Street, New York City (the Manhattan Mall) 

On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash. This mixed-use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block-front between 32nd and 33rd Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights. The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania. At closing, we completed a $232,000,000 financing secured by the property, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.20% at December 31, 2007) and has a two-year initial term with three one-year extension options. The operations of the office component of the property are included in the New York Office segment and the operations of the retail component are included in the Retail segment. We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

Bruckner Plaza, Bronx, New York 

On January 11, 2007, we acquired the Bruckner Plaza shopping center, containing 386,000 square feet, for $165,000,000 in cash. Also included as part of the acquisition was an adjacent parcel which is ground leased to a third party. The property is located on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx, New York. We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

H Street Building Corporation (H Street)  

In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000 of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet, and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10 acres of vacant land. In conjunction with this acquisition all existing litigation was dismissed. Beginning on April 30, 2007, we consolidate the accounts of these entities into our consolidated financial statements and ceased accounting for them on the equity method.  

Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000. On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 note due December 31, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain on sale of $4,803,000. In April 2007, we received letters from the two remaining ground lessees claiming a right of first offer on the sale of the land, one of which has since retracted its letter and reserved its rights under the lease.  

In connection with purchase accounting, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.  

The total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own, after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000, consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing mortgages.

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street  

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan office building located on the block-front between 51st and 52nd Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the three- building 555 California Street complex (555 California Street) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Franciscos financial district. The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt. Our share of the debt is comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. The operations of 1290 Avenue of the Americas are included in the New York Office segment and the operations of 555 California Street are included in the Other segment. We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above. Mr. Trumps claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships. In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trumps motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trumps claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records. In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  

In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trumps claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims. We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit. All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.

India Property Fund L.P. 

On June 14, 2007, we committed to contribute $95,000,000 to the India Property Fund, L.P. (the Fund), established to acquire, manage and develop real estate in India. In addition, we sold our interest in another India real estate partnership to the Fund for $77,000,000 and deferred the $3,700,000 net gain on sale. On December 20, 2007, we increased our commitment to the Fund by $20,000,000. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund has equity commitments aggregating $227,500,000, of which our $115,000,000 commitment represents 50.6%. In January 2008, the Fund completed capital calls aggregating $50,400,000, of which our share was $25,500,000.  

Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition 

On June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $351,000,000. The properties are located primarily in Northern New Jersey and Long Island, New York. We have completed the acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate purchase price of $250,478,000, consisting of $109,279,000 in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units, $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000 of existing mortgage debt. We have determined not to complete the acquisition of the remaining six properties and have expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.  

BNA Complex 

On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (BNA) for $111,000,000 in cash. The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washingtons West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District. We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments. We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  

Investments in Mezzanine Loans 

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $492,339,000 (net of a $57,000,000 allowance) and $561,164,000, respectively, substantially all of which are loans to companies that have significant real estate assets. Mezzanine loans are generally subordinate to first mortgage loans and are secured by pledges of equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. During 2007 we were repaid principal amounts aggregating $241,000,000 and we made new investments in mezzanine loans aggregating $217,000,000. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, these investments had a weighted average interest rate of 9.7% and 10.1%, respectively.  

On June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash. The loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56. We have reduced the net carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000 by recognizing a $57,000,000 non-cash charge which is included as a reduction of interest and other investment income on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Dispositions 

Investment in McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds) (NYSE: MCD) 

In July 2005 we acquired 858,000 McDonalds common shares at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share. These shares were classified as available-for-sale marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and the fluctuations in the market value of these shares during the period of our ownership was recorded as other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. During October 2007, we sold all of these shares at a weighted average price of $56.45 per share and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership.  

During the second half of 2005, we acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,500 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as investment income or loss on our consolidated statements of income. In 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share. As of December 31, 2006, there were 13,695,500 option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of $32.70 per share. During August, September and October 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net gains of $108,821,000, $138,815,000 and $17,254,000, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.  

The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000. 

Vineland, New Jersey Shopping Center Property 

On July 16, 2007, we sold our Vineland, New Jersey shopping center property for $2,774,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $1,708,000.  

Crystal Mall Two 

On August 9, 2007, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City for $103,600,000, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000.  

Arlington Plaza 

On October 17, 2007, we sold Arlington Plaza, a 188,000 square foot office building located in Arlington, Virginia for $71,500,000, which resulted in a net gain of $33,900,000.

Financings 

The net proceeds we received from the debt financings summarized below were used primarily to fund acquisitions and investments and for other general corporate purposes. In the future, we may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although we have no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions. We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire our shares or any other securities in the future.  

2.85% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2027 

On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances. The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares. 

We are amortizing the underwriters discount on a straight-line basis (which approximates the interest method) over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of April 1, 2012. Because the conversion option associated with the debentures, when analyzed as a freestanding instrument, meets the criteria to be classified as equity specified by paragraphs 12 to 32 of EITF 00-19 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys own Common Stock, separate accounting for the conversion option under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities is not appropriate. 

The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures.  

See Recently Issued Accounting Literature for details regarding a proposed FASB Staff Position that would change our current accounting for convertible and exchangeable debt.

Revolving Credit Facility 

On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term. The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points (5.43% at December 31, 2007), based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. Together with the existing $1.0 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.595 billion of unsecured revolving credit. Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnerships obligations under both revolving credit agreements. The existing $1.0 billion credit facilitys financial covenants have been modified to conform to the financial covenants under the new agreement. Significant modifications include (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reduce the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures. Under the new agreement, Equity Value may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; Total Outstanding Indebtedness may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of Capitalization Value; the ratio of Combined EBITDA to Fixed Charges, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of Unencumbered Combined EBITDA to Unsecured Interest Expense, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, Unsecured Indebtedness may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets; and the ratio of Secured Indebtedness to Capitalization Value, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%). The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants. The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007. 

Other 

In addition to the above, during 2007 we completed approximately $1.111 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $412,674,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds.

Other Investments 

The Lexington Master Limited Partnership, formerly The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership 

On December 31, 2006, Newkirk Realty Trust (NYSE: NKT) was acquired in a merger by Lexington Corporate Properties Trust (Lexington) (NYSE: LXP), a real estate investment trust. We owned 10,186,991 limited partnership units (representing a 15.8% investment ownership interest) of Newkirk MLP, which was also acquired by Lexington as a subsidiary, and was renamed Lexington MLP. The units in Newkirk MLP, which we accounted for on the equity method, were converted on a 0.80 for 1 basis into limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which we also account for on the equity method. The Lexington MLP units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of Lexington. We record our pro rata share of Lexington MLPs net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.  

As of December 31, 2007, we own 8,149,593 limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, or a 7.5% ownership interest. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in Lexington MLP based on Lexingtons December 31, 2007 closing share price of $14.54, was $118,495,000, or $39,836,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not other-than-temporary. 

GMH Communities L.P. (GMH) 

At December 31, 2007, we own 7,337,857 GMH Communities L.P. (GMH) limited partnership units, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (GCT), and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT, or 13.8% of the limited partnership interest of GMH. Our ownership interest was acquired primarily as a result of the exercise of stock purchase warrants during 2004 and 2006. See Note 5 Derivative Instruments and Related Marketable Securities for details of the warrants. We account for our investment in GMH on the equity method and record our pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements.  

On February 12, 2008, GCT announced that it has entered into two definitive agreements in connection with the sale of its military and student housing divisions for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.61 per share/unit. In addition, GCT anticipates selling its remaining assets prior to the closing of the merger. The merger, which has been unanimously approved by GCTs Board of Trustees, is subject to GCT shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.  

As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in GMH and GCT based on GCTs December 31, 2007 closing share price of $5.52, was $54,400,000, or $48,860,000 below the carrying amount of $10.48 per share/unit on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not other-than-temporary, based on the aggregate value anticipated to be received as a result of the transactions described above, including the additional consideration from the sale of GCTs remaining assets.

Critical Accounting Policies  

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Real Estate 

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $16.565 billion and $11.471 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. 

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If we incorrectly estimate the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of our estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  

Identified Intangible Assets  

Upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. 

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, were $601,232,000 and $303,609,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets, were $814,101,000 and $296,836,000, respectively. If the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Critical Accounting Policies  continued 

Mezzanine Loans Receivable 

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were $492,339,000 and $561,164,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The impact of our estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of our loans could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  

Partially Owned Entities 

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders and Toys R Us, were $1.517 billion and $1.453 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.  

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary.  

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts 

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($23,177,000 and $17,727,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($3,076,000 and $2,334,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies  continued 

Revenue Recognition 

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: 

   

Base Rent  income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.     

   

Percentage Rent  income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).    

   

Hotel Revenue  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.    

   

Trade Shows Revenue  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.    

   

Expense Reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.    

   

Temperature Controlled Logistics Revenue  income arising from our investment in Americold. Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.    

   

Management, Leasing and Other Fees  income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.     

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of our revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.  

Income Taxes 

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature  

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008. The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. SFAS 157 is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value, but may result in certain additional disclosures.  

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to (i) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans over-funded status or a liability for a plans under-funded status; (ii) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (iii) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Those changes will be reported in comprehensive income. The adoption of the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements as of December 31, 2006 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur is effective on January 1, 2009. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for us on January 1, 2008. We have not elected the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.  

On August 31, 2007, the FASB issued a proposed FASB Staff Position (the proposed FSP) that affects the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units. The proposed FSP requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component. The resulting discount must be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense. If adopted, we expect that the proposed FSP would be effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2009 and would require retroactive application. The adoption of the proposed FSP on January 1, 2009 would result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of $180,429,000 (as of December 31, 2007) on our consolidated balance sheet and additional interest expense on our consolidated statements of income. Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense, net of minority interest, for each reporting period is as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting Literature - continued 

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. It broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and stipulates that acquisition related costs be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition. SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired. 

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parents ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is effective on January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the preceding tabular information: 

(1)   

EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Income Applicable to Alexanders 

Income applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $50,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a loss of $14,530,000 for the prior year, an increase of $65,119,000. The increase was primarily due to (i) our $14,280,000 share of income in 2007 for the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense as compared to $49,043,000 for our share of expense in the prior year, (ii) an increase of $3,504,000 in our equity in earnings of Alexanders before stock appreciation rights and net gains on sales of condominiums, (iii) an increase of $3,758,000 in development fees in 2007, partially offset by (iv) our $4,580,000 share of Alexanders net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums in the prior year and (v) a $1,305,000 decrease in leasing fee income.

Our 32.7% share of Toys financial results (comprised of our share of Toys net loss, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 are for Toys fiscal periods from October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007 and October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2007, our loss applicable to Toys was $14,337,000, or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys income tax benefit, as compared to $47,520,000 or $70,147,000 before our share of Toys income tax benefit in the prior year. The decrease in our loss applicable to Toys before income tax benefit of $44,912,000 results primarily from (i) an increase in Toys net sales due to improvements in comparable store sales across all divisions and benefits in foreign currency translation, (ii) a net gain related to a lease termination, (iii) decreased interest expense primarily due to reduced borrowings and reduced amortization of deferred financing costs, partially offset by, (iv) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which as a percentage of net sales were 27.7% and 26.4% for the twelve month periods ended November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as a result of higher payroll, store occupancy, corporate and advertising expenses.

Income from Partially Owned Entities 

Summarized below are the components of income from partially owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

__________________________ 

(1)   

On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets and we now consolidate the accounts of these entities into our consolidated financial statements and no longer account for them under the equity method. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006 these corporations were contesting our acquisition of H Street and impeded our access to their financial information. Accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. 2006 includes $3,890 for our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005.    

(2)   

We record our pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements. On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005. On September 15, 2006 GCT filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Accordingly, equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a net loss of $1,013, which consists of (i) a $94 net loss representing our share of GMHs 2005 fourth quarter results, including adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005 and (ii) a net loss of $919 for our share of GMHs earnings through September 30, 2006.    

(3)   

On January 1, 2007, we began recording our pro rata share of Lexington MLPs net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements. Prior to the January 1, 2007, we recorded our pro rata share of Newkirk MLPs (Lexington MLPs predecessor) quarterly earnings current in our same quarter. Accordingly, our equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes our share of Lexington MLPs net income or loss for the nine month period from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2007.     

The decrease in our share of earnings from the prior year is primarily due to (i) the current year including our share of Lexington MLPs first, second and third quarter results (lag basis) compared to the prior year including our share of Newkirk MLPs full year results, (ii) higher depreciation expense and amortization of above market lease intangibles in the current year as a result of Lexingtons purchase price accounting adjustments in connection with the merger of Newkirk MLP on December 31, 2006, (iii) $10,842 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate in 2006 and (iv) a $10,362 net gain recognized in 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington.     

(4)   

Includes our equity in net earnings of partially owned entities, including partially owned office buildings in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others.

Interest and Other Investment Income 

Interest and other investment income (interest income on mezzanine loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $228,499,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $262,176,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $33,677,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the following: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Interest and Debt Expense 

Interest and debt expense was $634,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $476,461,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $158,093,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $80,255,000 from approximately $1.713 billion of mortgage financings and refinancings on our existing property portfolio during 2007 and 2006, (ii) $67,780,000 from a $1.754 billion of mortgage debt resulting from property acquisitions, (iii) $70,432,000 from senior unsecured financings, including $1.0 billion issued in November 2006 and $1.4 billion issued in March 2007, partially offset by, (iv) an increase of $28,240,000 in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development in 2007, (v) $25,119,000 of expense in 2006 from early extinguishments of debt, and (vi) $19,344,000 less interest in 2007 from the redemption of $500,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in May 2007.  

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate 

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $39,493,000 and $76,073,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of net gains from sales of marketable equity securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonalds common shares in 2007 and $55,438,000 from the sale of Sears Canada common shares in 2006.  

Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities 

Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $18,559,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to income of $20,173,000 in the prior year, a change of $1,614,000. Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 555 California Street, Americold Realty Trust, India Property Fund, 220 Central Park South, Wasserman and the Springfield Mall.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes was $10,530,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $2,326,000 for the prior year, an increase of $8,204,000. This increase results primarily from (i) the consolidation of two H Street corporations beginning on April 30, 2007, the date we acquired the remaining 50% of these corporations we did not previously own (we previously accounted for our 50% investment on the equity method) and (ii) $4,622,000 of Federal withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign corporations in connection with 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street, which we acquired in May 2007.  

In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.  

Discontinued Operations 

Income from discontinued operations in the table below represents the combined net income and net gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest, of the assets that are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets include 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007; 33 North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois, which was sold on March 14, 2006; 424 Sixth Avenue in New York City, which was sold on March 13, 2006 and 1919 South Eads Street in Arlington, Virginia, which was sold on June 22, 2006.

Minority Limited Partners Interest in the Operating Partnership 

Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership was $47,508,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $58,712,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $11,204,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority ownership in the Operating Partnership due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into our common shares during 2007 and 2006. 

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership 

Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $19,274,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $21,848,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $2,574,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of $45,000,000 Series D-9 preferred units and the write-off of $1,125,000 of Series D-9 issuance costs in October 2006.  

Preferred Share Dividends 

Preferred share dividends were $57,177,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $57,511,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $334,000.

Notes to preceding tabular information: 

(1)   

From our acquisition of trade show operations in Canada in November 2006.    

(2)   

Average occupancy and revenue per available room (REVPAR) were 82.1% and $109.53 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 83.7% and $96.85 in the prior year.     

(3)   

Primarily from $76,300 of transportation management services revenue in 2005 from a government agency for transportation services in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, partially offset by a $10,300 increase in other transportation revenue. See note 4 on page 99 for a discussion of Americolds gross margin.    

(4)   

Primarily from the acceleration of lease termination fees from MONY Life Insurance Company upon the termination of their 289,000 square foot lease at 1740 Broadway.     

(5)   

Primarily from lease termination income of $13,362 received from HIP at 7 West 34th Street in January 2005.     

(6)   

Reflects an increase in rentals and a reduction in leasing and management fees as a result of acquiring the Warner and Bowen buildings, which were previously partially owned and presented as managed for third parties.     

(7)   

Includes cleaning fees charged by BMS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Office division, to certain wholly-owned properties included in the Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions. The elimination of these inter-company fees is shown in the Other segment.

Expenses 

Our expenses, which consist of operating, depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses, were $1,977,294,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $1,801,451,000 in 2005, an increase of $175,843,000. Below are the details of the increase (decrease) by segment: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

_________________________ 

(1)   

From our acquisition of trade show operations in Canada in November 2006.    

(2)   

Primarily from higher marketing expenses for trade shows held in 2006.    

(3)   

Primarily from a reversal of $3,040 in allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents due to a change in estimate during the second quarter of 2006.    

(4)   

Primarily from $60,300 of transportation management services operating expenses in 2005 related to the services provided to a government agency in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, partially offset by a $16,000 increase in warehouse operating expenses, primarily due to an increase in utility rates. Americolds gross margin from owned warehouses was $150,000, or 31.2% for 2006, compared to $159,900, or 33.7% for 2005. The decrease in gross margin from owned warehouses was primarily due to higher facility costs as noted above. Gross margin from transportation management services, managed warehouses and other non-warehouse activities was $8,400, or 2.8% for 2006, compared to $24,300, or 6.5% for 2005, a $15,900 decrease. This decrease was primarily due to higher transportation revenues in 2005 as noted above.    

(5)   

The increase in corporate general and administrative expense results primarily from (i) $7,405 of amortization of stock-based compensation, including the 2006 Out-Performance Plan, stock option awards and restricted stock awards, (ii) $5,800 for our share of medicare taxes resulting from stock option exercises and the termination of a rabbi trust, (iii) an increase of $2,267 in professional fees, (iv) $2,299 from write-offs of acquisitions not consummated and (v) an increase of $1,218 in deferred compensation expense due to an increase in the value of the deferred compensation plan, which is offset by an equal amount of investment income.

(Loss) Income Applicable to Alexanders 

Loss applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $14,530,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to income of $59,022,000 in 2005, a decrease of $73,552,000. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a reduction in Alexanders net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums, of which our share was $26,315,000, as all of the condominium units have been sold and closed, (ii) an increase in Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation (SAR) expense, of which our share was $39,939,000, (iii) a $5,517,000 reduction in development and guarantee fees, primarily because 731 Lexington Avenue project was completed in 2005, and (iv) $6,122,000 of interest income in the prior year on loans to Alexanders that were repaid to us in July 2005, partially offset by, (v) an increase in Alexanders operating income, of which our share was $3,452,000.  

Loss Applicable to Toys   

In 2006, Toys closed 87 Toys R Us stores in the United States as a result of its store-closing program. Toys incurred restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $127,000,000 before tax, which includes $44,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Our share of the $127,000,000 charge was $42,000,000, of which $27,300,000 had no income statement effect as a result of purchase accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating inventory of approximately $9,100,000 after-tax, was recognized as an expense as part of our equity in Toys net income in 2006.  

We recorded a net loss of $47,520,000 from our investment in Toys for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to a net loss of $40,496,000 in 2005. The net loss in the current year consisted of (i) our $56,219,000 share of Toys net loss for the period from October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, which excludes our $9,377,000 share of the net gain recognized by Toys on the sale of 37 Toys R Us stores to us on October 16, 2006, which was recorded as an adjustment to the basis of our investment, partially offset by, (ii) $5,731,000 of interest income from our share of Toys senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $2,968,000 of management fees. The net loss in 2005 consisted of (i) our $46,789,000 share of Toys net loss for the period ended July 21, 2005 (date of our acquisition) to October 29, 2005, partially offset by (ii) $5,043,000 of interest from our share of Toys senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $1,250,000 of management fees.  

The unaudited information set forth below presents our pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005 (including Toys results for the twelve months ended October 29, 2005) as if the above transaction occurred on February 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma information below is not necessarily indicative of what our actual results would have been had the Toys transaction been consummated on February 1, 2004, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future periods. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect this transaction have been made.

2006 includes (i) a $10,362 net gain recognized as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington and (ii) $10,842 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate. 2005 includes (i) $9,445 for our share of losses on the early extinguishment of debt and write-off of related deferred financing costs, (ii) $6,602 for our share of impairment losses, partially offset by (iii) $4,236 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate. Excluding the above items, our share of Newkirk MLPs 2006 net income was $8,750 lower than 2005, primarily as a result of asset sales.    

(2)   

2005 includes $16,053 for our share of net gains on disposition of T-2 assets, partially offset by $8,470 for our share of expense from payment of promoted obligations to partner.    

(3)   

In 2006, we accounted for H Street partially owned entities on the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006, two 50% owned entities that were contesting our acquisition of H Street impeded our access to their financial information and accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2006, based on the financial information provided to us, we recognized equity in net income of $11,074 from these entities, of which $3,890 was for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005.    

(4)   

We account for our investment in GMH on the equity method and record our pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements. On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005. Accordingly, we recognized a net loss of $1,013 for the year ended December 31, 2006 for our share of GMHs earnings from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006. Of this amount, $94 represents our share of GMHs 2005 fourth quarter net loss, including adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005.    

(5)   

Includes our equity in net earnings of partially owned entities, including partially owned office buildings in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others.     

(6)   

Includes $2,173 for a prepayment penalty from the Monmouth Mall venture in August 2005 upon the repayment of our initial preferred equity investment.

Interest and Debt Expense 

Interest and debt expense was $476,461,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $338,097,000 in 2005, an increase of $138,364,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $69,200,000 from a $3.2 billion increase in outstanding debt due to property acquisitions and refinancings, (ii) $13,000,000 from a 117 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate of debt, (iii) $12,300,000 from the February 16, 2006 issuance of $250,000,000 unsecured notes due 2011, (iv) $33,400,000 for loan defeasance costs and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, partially offset by, (v) $10,614,000 of an increase in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development during 2006.  

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate 

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $76,073,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 consists primarily of net gains on sale of marketable equity securities. Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $39,042,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 is comprised of (i) $25,346,000 of net gains on sales of marketable equity securities, of which $9,017,000 relates to the disposition of the Prime Group common shares, (ii) $12,110,000 for the net gain on disposition of the Companys senior preferred equity investment in 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard and (iii) $1,586,000 relates to net gains on sale of land parcels.  

Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities 

Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including Americold, 220 Central Park South, Wasserman and the Springfield Mall. Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $20,173,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to expense of $3,808,000 in the prior year, a change of $23,981,000. This change relates primarily to Americold, which had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net income for the year ended December 31, 2005.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

On March 13, 2006, we sold 424 Sixth Avenue, a 10,000 square foot retail property located in New York City, for $22,000,000, which resulted in a net gain of $9,218,000.  

On March 14, 2006, we sold 33 North Dearborn Street, a 336,000 square foot office building located in Chicago, Illinois, for $46,000,000, which resulted in a net gain of $4,835,000.  

On June 22, 2006, we sold 1919 South Eads Street, a 96,000 square foot office building located in Arlington, Virginia for $38,400,000, which resulted in a net gain of $17,609,000. 

On April 21, 2005, we, through our 85% joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452-unit high-rise residential tower in Chicago, Illinois, for $126,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $31,614,000.  

Minority Limited Partners Interest in the Operating Partnership 

Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership was $58,712,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $66,755,000 in 2005, a decrease of $8,043,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority ownership in the Operating Partnership due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into our common shares during 2006 and 2005. 

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership 

Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $21,848,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $67,119,000 in 2005, a decrease of $45,271,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of an aggregate of $742,000,000 8.25% Series D preferred units (Series D-3 through D-9) during 2005 and 2006, partially offset by the issuance of $100,000,000 6.75% D-14 units in September 2005 and the issuance of the $45,000,000 6.875% D-15 units in May and August 2006.  

Preferred Share Dividends 

Preferred share dividends were $57,511,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $46,501,000 in 2005, an increase of $11,010,000. This increase resulted primarily from dividends paid on the 6.75% Series H and 6.625% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares which were issued in June 2005 and August 2005, respectively, partially offset by a $3,852,000 write-off of issuance costs in the first quarter of 2005 related to the redemption of the Series C preferred shares.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2007  continued 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday seasons impact on the food industry.

Related Party Transactions 

Loans and Compensation Agreements 

On November 30, 2006, Michael Fascitelli, our President, repaid to the Company his $8,600,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2006. The loan was made to him in 1996 pursuant to his employment agreement. 

On December 31, 2006, 1,546,106 shares held in a rabbi trust, established for deferred compensation purposes as part of Mr. Fascitellis 1996 and 2001 employment agreements, were distributed to Mr. Fascitelli, net of 739,130 shares which were used to satisfy the resulting tax withholding obligation. The shares we received for the tax liability were retired upon receipt.  

On March 26, 2007, Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President  Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, repaid to the Company his $2,000,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature June 2007.  

Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office Division. This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter. The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share. These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us. The agreement also provides that if we terminate Mr. Schears employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one years salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees 

Alexanders 

We own 32.8% of Alexanders. Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexanders. We provide various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.  

On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexanders granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexanders common stock. The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexanders common stock on date of grant. The SAR became exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexanders on such date, and was set to expire on March 14, 2007. Mr. Fascitellis early exercise and Alexanders related tax consequences were factors in Alexanders decision to make the new grant to him. On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President of Alexanders, exercised 350,000 of his SARS and received $144.18 for each SAR exercised representing the difference between Alexanders stock price of $388.01 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $243.83.

Interstate Properties (Interstate) 

Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders, are Interstates two other partners. As of December 31, 2007, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexanders common stock. 

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $800,000, $798,000 and $791,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.  

Other

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.  

Acquisitions and Investments 

We completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 2007 and $1,650,559,000 in 2006. In addition, we made $217,081,000 of mezzanine loans during 2007 and $363,374,000 in 2006. These acquisitions and investments were consummated through our subsidiaries and were financed with available cash, mortgage indebtedness, and/or the issuance of operating partnership equity. The related assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Excluding our acquisition of a 70% interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street in May 2007, the pro forma effect of the acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our historical consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Details of our 2007 acquisitions and investments are summarized in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Details of our 2006 acquisitions and investments are summarized below.  

San Francisco Bay Area Properties 

On January 10, 2006, we acquired four properties for $72,000,000 in cash. The properties are located in the San Francisco Bay area and contain a total of 189,000 square feet of retail and office space. We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  

Springfield Mall, Virginia 

On January 31, 2006, we acquired an option to purchase the Springfield Mall for $35,600,000, of which we paid $14,000,000 in cash upon closing and $13,200,000 in installments through December 31, 2007. The remainder of $8,400,000 will be paid in installments over the next two years. The mall, located on 79 acres at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road in Springfield, Virginia, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macys, and J.C. Penney and Target who own their stores aggregating 389,000 square feet. We intend to redevelop, reposition and re-tenant the mall. The option becomes exercisable upon the passing of one of the existing principals of the selling entity and may be deferred at our election through November 2012. Upon exercise of the option, we will pay $80,000,000 to acquire the mall, subject to the existing mortgage of $180,000,000, which will be amortized to $149,000,000 at maturity in 2013. Upon closing of the option on January 31, 2006, we acquired effective control of the mall, including management of the mall and right to the malls net cash flow. Accordingly, we consolidate the accounts of the mall into our consolidated financial statements pursuant to the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). We have a 2.5% minority partner in this transaction.  

San Jose, California Ground-up Development 

On March 29, 2006, a joint venture, in which we have a 45% equity interest and are a co-managing partner, acquired 55 acres of land in San Jose, California for $59,600,000. The purchase price was funded with $20,643,000 of cash contributed by the partners, of which our share was $9,289,000, and $38,957,000 drawn on a $117,000,000 acquisition/construction loan, the balance of which will be used to fund the development of 325,000 square feet of retail space and site work for Home Depot and Target who will construct their own stores. As of December 31, 2007, a total of $101,045,000 has been drawn under the loan.

On October 16, 2006, we completed the first phase of the agreement by acquiring 37 stores for $171,000,000 in cash. All of these stores were part of the store closing program announced by Toys in January 2006. We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Our $9,377,000 share of Toys net gain on this transaction was recorded as an adjustment to the basis of our investment in Toys and was not recorded as income.  

India Real Estate Investment 

On December 12, 2006, we contributed $71,500,000 in cash for a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns 263 acres of land in a special economic zone in the national capital region of India.

Certain Future Cash Requirements 

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures 

We are currently engaged in various development and redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.977 billion in future capital expenditures, of which $719,600,000 is budgeted for 2008. Details of our development and redevelopment activities are summarized in Item 1. Business, in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Other Capital Expenditures 

The following table summarizes other anticipated 2008 capital expenditures.

Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2008 leasing activity are $57.25 ($3.82 per annum) and $18.74 ($3.75 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively.     

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of non-consolidated entities, including Alexanders and Toys, as these entities will fund their own capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.  

Dividends and Distributions 

Based on fourth quarter 2007 dividend rates, we anticipate that the Operating Partnership will make distributions in 2008 aggregating approximately $688,000,000 to its unitholders. Of this amount, approximately $608,000,000 will be distributed directly to us, as the majority owner of such units, and we, in turn, will distribute 100% of such amount in the form of common and preferred dividends to our shareholders.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations 

Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect thereto. We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire our shares or any other securities in the future.  

We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes, and that as of December 31, 2007 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a well-known seasoned issuer.  

At December 31, 2007, our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility had $49,788,000 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants, which require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. At December 31, 2007, Americolds $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had $19,086,000 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility requires Americold to maintain, on a trailing four-quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

During 2007, we completed approximately $1.400 billion of senior unsecured financings and $1.111 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $912,674,000 of existing debt. During 2006, we completed approximately $1.250 billion of senior unsecured financings and $3.689 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $1.848 billion of existing debt. In addition, during 2006, we issued approximately $1.004 billion of common shares and $43,819,000 of preferred shares. The net proceeds we received from 2007 and 2006 financings were used primarily to fund acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes, unless otherwise noted. Details of our 2007 financing activities are summarized in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Details of our 2006 financing activities are summarized below.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations  continued  

On February 16, 2006, we completed a public offering of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.6% senior unsecured notes due February 15, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing August 16, 2006. The notes were priced at 99.906% of their face amount to yield 5.622%. The net proceeds of approximately $248,000,000 were used for general corporate purposes.  

On May 2, 2006, we sold 1,400,000 6.875% Series D-15 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership at a price of $25.00 per unit. On August 17, 2006 we sold an additional 400,000 Series D-15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit, for a combined total of 1,800,000 Series D-15 units and net proceeds of $43,875,000. The net proceeds received were used for general corporate purposes. We may redeem the Series D-15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit after May 2, 2011.  

On June 28, 2006, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous $600,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to mature in July 2006. The new facility has a four-year term, with a one-year extension option and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.70% as of December 31, 2007).  

On July 28, 2006, we called for redemption of the 8.25% Series D-9 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The Preferred Units were redeemed on September 21, 2006 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per unit or an aggregate of $45,000,000 plus accrued distributions. In conjunction with the redemption, we expensed $1,125,000 of issuance costs in 2006. 

On November 20, 2006, we sold $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% convertible senior debentures due 2026, pursuant to an effective registration statement. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discounts and expenses, were approximately $980,000,000. The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for common shares of Vornado Realty Trust at an initial conversion rate of 6.5168 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price of $153.45 represented a premium of 30% over the November 14, 2006 closing price for our common shares. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2011 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2011, 2016, and 2021 and in the event of a change in control. The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds primarily for acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes. 

On December 11, 2006, we sold 8,100,000 common shares in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at a price of $124.05 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $1,004,500,000, after offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 8,100,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.

Insurance 

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA), which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $1.5 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through September 15, 2008. AmeriCold has $250,000,000 of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through January 1, 2009. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate limit.  

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (PPIC), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for certified acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) acts, as defined by TRIPRA. Coverage for certified acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for losses under NBCR coverage. Subsequently, we have $1.5 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC. 

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey claiming we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Courts decision. On December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Courts decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Courts decision which was denied on March 13, 2007. We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2008. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

We have made acquisitions and investments in partially owned entities for which we are committed to fund additional capital aggregating $167,389,000 as of December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $115,000,000 relates to our equity commitment to the India Property Fund, L.P., and $21,800,000 relates to capital expenditures committed to the Springfield Mall, in which we have a 97.5% interest.  

On November 10, 2005, we committed to fund the junior portion of up to $30,530,000 of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mixed-use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor. We earn current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%. The loan matures in November 2008, with a one-year extension option. As of December 31, 2007, we have funded $18,912,000 of this commitment.  

We enter into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in our name by various money center banks. We have the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon. We had $82,240,000 and $219,990,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

On January 16, 2008, our Board of Trustees approved the termination of the Vornado Realty Trust Employees Retirement Plan and the Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan. These plans were frozen in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Our current estimate of the cost we will incur during 2008 to buy annuities from an insurance company or to make lump-sum payments to plan participants to terminate both plans is approximately $4,000,000. 

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 

From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 

Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities. Property rental income is primarily dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.

Funds From Operations (FFO) 

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in Our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 17. Income per Share, in our notes to consolidated financial statements on page 190 of this annual report on Form 10-K.  

FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $966,638,000, or $5.89 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $858,693,000, or $5.51 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $193,412,000 or $1.18 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2007, compared to $211,812,000, or $1.34 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2006.
