Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Results of Operations  

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team does participate in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  

The declines in global economic activity over the last half of 2008 continued through 2009. Our operating results in 2009 were significantly impacted by those declines. Earnings in 2009 of most of our diverse group of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined compared to the prior year. The effects from the economic recession resulted in lower sales volume, revenues and profit margins as consumers have significantly curtailed spending, particularly for discretionary items. Our two largest business segments, insurance and utilities, remain strong and operating results have not been negatively impacted in any significant way by the recession. In 2008 and the first part of 2009, equity and debt markets experienced major declines in market prices on a worldwide basis, which negatively impacted the fair value of our investments and derivative contracts. While market prices recovered somewhat over the remainder of 2009, the potential for significant declines in our investment values in the future remains.  

We had after-tax net investment and derivative gains of $486 million in 2009, while in 2008 we had losses of $4.6 billion. The gains and losses primarily derived from credit default contracts, dispositions of certain equity securities, other-than-temporary impairment charges with respect to certain equity securities and changes in estimated fair values of long duration equity index put option contracts. Changes in the equity and credit markets from period to period have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.  

In response to the crises in the financial markets and the global recession, the U.S. government and governments around the world are taking measures to stabilize financial institutions, regulate markets (including over-the-counter derivatives markets) and stimulate economic activity. While we believe that general economic conditions will improve over time, the ultimate impact of these actions on us is not clear at this time. Our operating companies have taken and will continue to take cost reduction actions as necessary to manage through the current economic situation. We continue to believe that the economic franchises of our operating businesses remain intact and that our operating results will ultimately improve, although we cannot predict the timing of an economic recovery that will be required for this to occur.  

InsuranceUnderwriting  

We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re, we also reinsure life and health risks.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued)  

Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income.  

Our periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. In two out of the last three years, we benefited from relatively minor levels of catastrophe losses. In 2008, our underwriting results included estimated losses of approximately $900 million from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. In 2009 and 2008, our underwriting results also included significant unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities into U.S. Dollars as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  

A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $64 billion at December 31, 2009. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.  

A summary follows of underwriting results from our insurance businesses for the past three years. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GEICO  

Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICOs policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICOs underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.

Premiums earned in 2009 increased $1,097 million (8.8%) over premiums earned in 2008, reflecting growth in voluntary auto premiums earned as a result of an overall increase in policies-in-force of 7.8%. Policies-in-force grew more rapidly in the latter part of 2008 and the early part of 2009 and moderated over the remainder of 2009. As a result, premiums earned in 2009 increased at a higher rate than policies-in-force, despite a slight decline in premiums per policy. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2009 increased 9.0% versus 2008. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2009 were 684,000 greater than at December 31, 2008.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2009 increased $1,125 million (12.1%) compared with 2008. The loss ratio was 77.0% in 2009 compared to 74.8% in 2008. The higher loss ratio in 2009 reflected overall increases in average claim frequencies and injury claim severities. Claims frequencies in 2009 for physical damage coverages increased in the one to two percent range, while frequencies for injury coverages increased in the five to seven percent range compared with the very low frequency levels in 2008. Average injury severities in 2009 increased in the three to five percent range while average physical damage severities decreased in the two to four percent range from 2008. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2009 were $83 million, relatively unchanged from 2008. Underwriting expenses in 2009 increased $239 million (10.7%) due primarily to higher policy issuance costs and increased salary and employee benefit expenses, which included increased interest on deferred compensation liabilities.  

Premiums earned in 2008 increased 5.7% over 2007, reflecting an 8.2% increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force partially offset by lower average premiums per policy. Average premiums per policy declined during 2007 but leveled off in 2008. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2008 increased 9.5% over 2007. Incurred losses from catastrophe events for 2008 were $87 million compared to $34 million for 2007. Overall, the increase in the loss ratio reflected higher average claim severities and lower average premiums per policy, partially offset by lower average claims frequencies. Claims frequencies in 2008 for physical damage coverages decreased in the seven to nine percent range from 2007 and frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the four to six percent range. Physical damage severities in 2008 increased in the six to eight percent range and injury severities increased in the five to eight percent range over 2007. Underwriting expenses in 2008 increased $61 million (2.8%) over 2007. Policy acquisition expenses increased 8.5% in 2008 to $1,508 million, primarily due to increased advertising and policy issuance costs. The increase in policy acquisition expenses was partially offset by lower other underwriting expenses, including lower interest on deferred compensation liabilities.  

General Re  

General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. Property and casualty reinsurance is written in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through Cologne Re. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Res underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

Premiums written in 2009 declined $292 million (8.6%) from 2008, which included $205 million with respect to a reinsurance-to-close transaction that increased our economic interest in the run-off of Lloyds Syndicate 435s 2000 year of account from 39% to 100%. Under the reinsurance-to-close transaction, we also assumed a corresponding amount of net loss

 reserves and as a result, there was no impact on net underwriting gains in 2008. There was no similar transaction in 2009. Excluding the reinsurance-to-close transaction and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written in 2009 increased $149 million (4.7%) compared to 2008, primarily due to increased volume in North American, European treaty and Lloyds market property business.  

Premiums earned in 2009 declined $231 million (6.7%) from 2008. Excluding the effects of the reinsurance-to-close transaction in 2008 and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased $107 million (3.3%) in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in premiums earned in 2009 was primarily due to increased volume in European treaty and Lloyds market property business. Increased price competition and capacity within the industry could lead to a decline in our premium volume in 2010.  

Underwriting results in 2009 included underwriting gains of $478 million from property business and losses of $178 million from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $173 million for the 2009 accident year, and $305 million from loss reserve reductions related to pre-2009 loss events. The property gains in 2009 were net of $48 million of losses from catastrophes, which were primarily from winter storm Klaus in Europe, the Victoria bushfires in Australia and an earthquake in Italy. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business were primarily the result of establishing higher loss reserves for 2009 accident year occurrences to reflect higher loss trends as well as $118 million of workers compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years casualty and workers compensation loss reserves.  

Premiums written and earned in 2008 declined compared with 2007. Premiums in 2007 included $114 million from a reinsurance-to-close transaction which increased our economic interest in Lloyds Syndicate 435s 2001 year of account to 100%. Otherwise, the declines in written and earned premiums in 2008 versus 2007 reflected underwriting discipline as the volume of business accepted declined where pricing was considered inadequate.  

Underwriting results in 2008 included $275 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $112 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $120 million for the 2008 accident year, offset by $395 million of gains from loss reserve reductions related to pre-2008 loss events. The 2008 accident year results included $174 million of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $56 million of catastrophe losses from European storms. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business in 2008 included $117 million of workers compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years other casualty lines. The casualty results were adversely impacted by legal costs incurred in connection with regulatory investigations of finite reinsurance.  

Underwriting results in 2007 included $519 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $44 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $90 million for the 2007 accident year and $429 million from loss reserve reductions related to pre-2007 loss events. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty business in 2007 included $120 million of loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, as well as legal costs associated with finite reinsurance investigations. These charges were largely offset by underwriting gains in other casualty business.  

Life/health  

Life and health reinsurance premiums earned in 2009 increased 1.8% over 2008, which increased 4.8% over 2007. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, premiums earned increased 4.7% over 2008, which increased 2.2% over 2007. The increase in premiums earned in 2009 was primarily due to international business. The increase in premiums earned in 2008 was primarily from North American life business. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced underwriting gains of $177 million in 2009, $179 million in 2008 and $80 million in 2007. Life/health results were profitable in each of the past three years driven by gains from the life business due primarily to favorable mortality.

InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued)  

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  

Through the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG), we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. Our business in BHRG includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, participations in and contracts with Lloyds syndicates as well as property, aviation and workers compensation programs. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). The timing and magnitude of losses produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRGs catastrophe and individual risk business. In early 2009, we constrained the volume of business written in response to the decline in our consolidated net worth that occurred in the first quarter. Though our net worth recovered significantly since then, we have continued to constrain the volume of business written in light of the BNSF acquisition. Also, premium rates were not attractive enough in 2009 to warrant increasing volume.  

Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $725 million in 2009, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $1.2 billion in 2007. The decreases in premium volume were principally attributable to increased industry capacity for catastrophe reinsurance and, consequently, fewer opportunities to write business at prices we considered adequate. Based on soft market conditions prevailing at the end of 2009, we expect premium volume will continue to be constrained for at least the first half of 2010. The level of catastrophe and individual risk business we write in a given period will vary significantly based upon market conditions and our assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2009 declined 14% from 2008, which decreased 39% from 2007.  

Underwriting results of our catastrophe and individual risk business in 2009 reflected no significant losses from catastrophes during the year, while in 2008 we incurred approximately $270 million of estimated losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Underwriting gains in 2008 included $224 million from a contract in which we agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $4 billion of revenue bonds issued by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation. Our obligation was conditioned upon, among other things, the occurrence of a specified amount of Florida hurricane losses during a period that expired on December 31, 2008 and which was not met. Catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results in 2007 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events occurring in that year.  

Premiums earned in 2009 from retroactive reinsurance included 2 billion Swiss Francs (CHF) (approximately $1.7 billion) from an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its affiliates (Swiss Re) covering substantially all of Swiss Res non-life insurance losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for loss events occurring prior to January 1, 2009. The Swiss Re contract provides aggregate limits of indemnification of 5 billion CHF in excess of a retention of Swiss Res reported loss reserves at December 31, 2008 (58.725 billion CHF) less 2 billion CHF. The impact on underwriting results from this contract was negligible as the premiums earned were offset by a corresponding amount of losses incurred. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2007 included $7.1 billion from a reinsurance agreement with Equitas which became effective on March 30, 2007. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)  

Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance include the recurring amortization of deferred charges that were initially established at the inception of these reinsurance contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method and are based on estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Amortization charges are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses.  

Premiums earned in 2009 from other multi-line business of $3.89 billion were relatively unchanged from 2008. Premiums earned in 2009 and 2008 included $2.77 billion and $1.83 billion, respectively, from a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Re covering substantially all of Swiss Res property/casualty risks incepting from January 1, 2008 and running through December 31, 2012. Excluding the Swiss Re quota-share contract, other multi-line business premiums earned in 2009 declined $969 million (46%) compared to 2008, primarily due to significant reductions in aviation, property, workers compensation and Lloyds market volume. Other multi-line premiums earned in 2008 increased $1.31 billion (50%) over 2007 reflecting premiums earned from the Swiss Re quota-share contract partially offset by lower premium volume from workers compensation programs.  

Pre-tax underwriting results from other multi-line reinsurance in 2009 included foreign currency transaction losses of about $280 million. The non-cash losses arose from the conversion of certain reinsurance loss reserves and other liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (primarily the U.K. Pound Sterling). The value of these currencies rose overall relative to the U.S. Dollar in 2009, resulting in losses. In 2008, underwriting results included foreign currency transaction gains of approximately $930 million, resulting from sharp declines in the Euro and U.K. Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar.  

Excluding the effects of the currency gains/losses, other multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $295 million in 2009, $32 million in 2008 and $435 million in 2007. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2008 included approximately $435 million of estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2009 or 2007, which also benefited from relatively low property loss ratios and favorable loss experience on workers compensation business.  

In December 2007, we formed a monoline financial guarantee insurance company, Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation (BHAC). BHAC commenced operations during the first quarter of 2008 and is licensed in 49 states. In its first year of operation, BHAC produced $595 million of written premiums. In 2009, as a result of changing market conditions and demand, BHAC wrote about $40 million in premiums, most of which was in the first half of the year.  

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  

Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (MedPro), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Companys primary group operation (NICO Primary Group), a writer of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as Homestate operations, providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft.  

Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses were $1,773 million in 2009, $1,950 million in 2008 and $1,999 million in 2007. In 2009, with the exception of BoatU.S., each of our primary businesses generated lower premiums written and earned compared to 2008. Pre-tax underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 5% in 2009, 11% in 2008 and 14% in 2007. The declines in underwriting gains in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 resulted from higher loss ratios as increased price competition narrowed profit margins, and higher expense ratios, which reflected the impact of fixed costs on lower premium volume.

InsuranceInvestment Income  

A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and investments allocable to our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2009 exceeded 2008 by $451 million. The increase in investment income in 2009 primarily reflected earnings from several large investments made in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first half of 2009, partially offset by lower earnings on cash and cash equivalents due to lower short-term interest rates and lower average cash balances.  

In October 2008, we acquired securities issued by Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. In March 2009, we acquired a 12% convertible perpetual instrument of Swiss Re and in April 2009, we acquired an 8.5% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow. In December 2009, we also acquired $1.0 billion par amount of new senior notes issued by Wrigley. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments were purchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.1 billion. At December 31, 2009, approximately 85% of these securities were held in our insurance group, with the remainder held primarily in our finance and financial products businesses. Our insurance group earned about $1.65 billion in interest and dividends from the aforementioned investments in 2009. Partially offsetting these increases were reductions in dividends earned from our investments in Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp common stock as a result of dividend rate cuts by those companies.  

Beginning in 2009, our insurance investment income also includes earnings from equity method investments (BNSF and Moodys). Equity method earnings represent our proportionate share of the net earnings of these companies. As a result of a reduction of our ownership of Moodys in July of 2009, we discontinued the use of the equity method for our investment in Moodys as of the beginning of the third quarter. Dividends earned on equity method investments are not reflected in our earnings.  

A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Other investments include the investments in Wrigley, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Swiss Re and Dow as well as the investment in BNSF, which as of December 31, 2008 is accounted for under the equity method. Berkshires investment in Moodys was accounted for under the equity method at December 31, 2008 but included in equity securities at December 31, 2009. In 2007, investments in BNSF and Moodys are included in equity securities.

Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2009 were as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and approximately 85% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3.  

Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $62 billion at December 31, 2009, $58 billion at December 31, 2008 and $59 billion at December 31, 2007. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance businesses generated underwriting gains in each year.  

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican)  

Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican for each of the past three years are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

Through our 89.5% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican), we operate an international energy business. MidAmericans domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses. The rates that our utilities and natural gas pipelines charge customers for energy and other services are

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican) (Continued)  

 generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent we are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States.  

Our U.S. based regulated utilities businesses are conducted through MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC) and PacifiCorp. Revenues of MEC in 2009 declined $1,031 million (22%) from 2008, primarily due to lower regulated natural gas and electricity sales. Regulated natural gas revenues decreased by $520 million in 2009 primarily due to a lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is passed on to customers and a 5% decline in sales volume. MECs regulated electricity revenues declined $315 million primarily as a result of a 35% decline in average wholesale prices and lower volumes, which are attributable to reduced demand in the current economic environment as well as mild temperatures in 2009. MECs earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (EBIT) in 2009 declined $140 million (33%) compared to 2008, primarily due to the lower regulated electricity revenues and increased depreciation due to additions of new wind-power generation facilities, partially offset by lower costs of purchased electricity and natural gas.  

MECs revenues in 2008 increased $417 million (10%) over 2007. The increase reflects (1) increased regulated natural gas revenues from cost based price increases that are largely passed on to customers, (2) increased non-regulated gas revenues due primarily to higher prices and, to a lesser degree, increased volume and (3) increased wholesale regulated electricity revenues driven by volume increases. EBIT of MEC in 2008 increased $13 million (3%) versus 2007, resulting primarily from higher operating margins on wholesale regulated electricity and slightly higher margins from regulated gas sales, partially offset by increased interest expense and lower miscellaneous income.  

PacifiCorps revenues in 2009 of $4,543 million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Revenues in 2009 reflect an overall decrease in sales volume (both wholesale and retail) of approximately 2% and lower wholesale prices, somewhat offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorps EBIT in 2009 of $788 million increased $85 million (12%) over 2008, primarily due to lower volume and prices of energy purchased in response to lower sales volumes and the use of lower-cost generation facilities put into service in the second half of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.  

PacifiCorps revenues in 2008 increased $239 million (6%) over 2007. The increase was primarily related to higher retail revenues due to regulator approved rate increases as well as increased customer growth and usage. PacifiCorps EBIT in 2008 increased $11 million (2%) versus 2007, as higher revenues were substantially offset by increased fuel costs and interest expense.  

Our natural gas pipeline businesses are conducted through Northern Natural Gas and Kern River. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT in 2009 declined $148 million and $138 million, respectively, from 2008 due primarily to lower volumes due to the current economic climate, lower price spreads and the effects of a favorable rate proceeding included in the results for 2008. Natural gas pipelines revenues in 2008 increased $133 million (12%) over 2007. The increase reflected increased transportation revenue as a result of stronger market conditions at Northern Natural Gas, the impact of system expansion projects and changes related to Kern Rivers current rate proceeding. EBIT in 2008 of the natural gas pipeline businesses increased $122 million (26%) over 2007, reflecting the impact of increased revenues.  

U.K. utility revenues in 2009 declined $172 million (17%) versus 2008, principally due to the impact from foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2009 as compared with 2008. EBIT of the U.K. utilities in 2009 declined $91 million (27%) compared to 2008. The decline in EBIT reflects foreign currency exchange rate changes as well as higher depreciation expense and charges to write down certain exploration and development assets. U.K. utility revenues in 2008 declined $113 million (10%) versus 2007 primarily from the effect of the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the U.K. Pound Sterling over the second half of 2008. EBIT in 2008 was relatively unchanged from 2007 as the revenue decline was offset primarily by lower operating costs and interest expense.

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican) (Continued)  

Real estate brokerage revenues declined $76 million (7%) as compared to 2008. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower home sales prices, as transaction volume was relatively unchanged from 2008. EBIT was $43 million in 2009 compared to a $45 million loss in 2008. The improvement in 2009 was principally due to lower commission and other operating expenses. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2008 declined $364 million (24%) compared to 2007 due to significant declines in transaction volume as well as lower average home sale prices. Real estate brokerage activities generated a loss before interest and taxes of $45 million in 2008 versus EBIT of $42 million in 2007. The loss in 2008 reflected the weak U.S. housing markets.  

EBIT from other activities in 2009 included $125 million in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the purchase of common stock issued by MidAmerican upon the exercise of the last remaining stock options that had been granted to certain members of management at the time of Berkshires acquisition of MidAmerican in 2000. Revenues and EBIT in 2008 from other activities included a gain of $917 million from MidAmericans investments in Constellation Energy and a fee of $175 million received as a result of the termination of the planned acquisition of Constellation Energy.  

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing  

A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses for each of the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * We evaluate the results of NetJets using accounting standards for recognition of revenue and planned major maintenance expenses that were generally accepted when we acquired NetJets but are no longer acceptable due to subsequent changes adopted by the FASB. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for our other service businesses shown above reflect these prior revenue and expense recognition methods. Revenues shown above exceeded (were less than) the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements by $(942) million in 2009, $130 million in 2008 and $709 million in 2007. Pre-tax earnings in this table exceeded (were less than) the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements by $(142) million in 2009, $(4) million in 2008 and $48 million in 2007.   

Marmon  

We acquired a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (Marmon) on March 18, 2008 and currently own a 64% interest. Marmons revenues, costs and expenses are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of the initial acquisition date. Revenues in 2009 declined approximately 27% from 2008 (including periods in 2008 prior to our acquisition). The revenue decline in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession which led to lower customer demand across all sectors, and particularly in the Building Wire, Engineered Wire and Cable, Flow Products and Distribution Services sectors. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 declined approximately 26% from the full year of 2008 which reflects the decline in revenues, somewhat offset by a $160 million reduction in operating costs resulting from cost reduction efforts. In 2009, the Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment and Water Treatment sectors produced comparable or improved earnings with 2008 despite lower revenues. The remaining sectors experienced lower earnings in 2009 compared to 2008.

McLane Company  

McLane Company, Inc., (McLane) is a wholesale distributor of grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLanes business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. Revenues were $31,207 million in 2009, an increase of $1,355 million (5%) compared to 2008. The increase in revenues in 2009 reflected an 8% increase in the grocery business, partially offset by an 11% decline from the foodservice business. The revenue increases in 2009 reflected additional grocery customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Approximately one-third of McLanes annual revenues are from Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on McLanes earnings.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2009 increased $68 million (25%) over 2008. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of a substantial inventory price change gain associated with an increase in federal excise tax on cigarettes. Many tobacco manufacturers raised prices in anticipation of the tax increase, which allowed McLane to generate a one-time price change gain. The increase in earnings from the inventory price change gain was partially offset by a federally mandated one-time floor stock tax on related inventory held and by lower earnings from the foodservice business. The gross margin rate in 2009 was 5.72%. Cigarette excise tax inflation has a negative impact on margins by inflating gross sales while providing only marginal increases in profit since most markups are on a fixed amount per unit as opposed to a percentage of gross sales. Operating results in 2009 also benefited from lower fuel costs and operating expense control efforts.  

In 2008, revenues increased $1,773 million (6%) compared to 2007, reflecting increased customers and manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 increased $44 million (19%) over 2007. The increase in earnings in 2008 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and to a lesser degree a slight increase in gross margins. The gross margin rate was 5.91% in 2008 compared to 5.79% in 2007. The comparative increase in the gross margin rate reflected price changes related to certain categories of grocery products and the impact of a heavy liquids sales surcharge.  

Shaw Industries  

Shaw Industries (Shaw) is the worlds largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets and is a full-service flooring company. Shaws sales volume and earnings during the last two years have been negatively impacted by the depressed residential housing market and the economic recession in the U.S.  

Revenues in 2009 were $4,011 million, a decline of $1,041 million (21%) from 2008. The revenue decrease in 2009 was primarily due to an 18% reduction in year-to-date carpet sales volume. In 2009, pre-tax earnings declined $61 million (30%) from 2008. Our operating results in 2009 benefitted from lower raw material costs. However, the favorable impact of the lower material costs was more than offset by relatively higher manufacturing costs attributable to significant declines in sales volume, which decreased plant operating levels and manufacturing efficiencies and resulted in lower selling and general expense coverage. During 2009, Shaw incurred costs of $101 million related to plant closures compared to $59 million in 2008.  

Revenues in 2008 declined $321 million (6%) compared to 2007, principally due to a reduction in year-to-date carpet sales volume, partially offset by higher average selling prices and revenues from business acquisitions. In 2008, pre-tax earnings declined $231 million (53%) to $205 million. The decline was attributable to both lower sales volume and higher product costs. Increases in petrochemical based raw material costs along with reduced manufacturing efficiencies caused the product cost increase. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 also included the aforementioned $59 million of charges related to plant closures.  

Other manufacturing  

Our other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel business). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, CTB International (CTB), a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industries and ISCAR Metalworking Companies (IMC), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide.

Other manufacturing (Continued)  

Nearly all of the businesses in our manufacturing group experienced the adverse effects of the global economic recession in 2009 as consumers and customers cut purchases. Revenues in 2009 were $11,926 million, a decrease of $2,201 million (16%) from 2008. Revenues were lower for apparel (11%), building products (20%) and other businesses (16%) as compared to 2008. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $814 million in 2009, a decrease of $861 million (51%) versus 2008. The declines in earnings reflected the lower revenues as well as relatively higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing efficiencies. Revenues of $14,127 million in 2008 declined $332 million (2%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings were $1,675 million in 2008, a decline of $362 million (18%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings declined or were relatively unchanged in nearly all of our other manufacturing operations. All of our other manufacturing businesses have taken actions to reduce costs and reduce or delay capital spending until the economy improves.  

Other service  

Our other service businesses include NetJets, the worlds leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft, and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor (acquired March 2007); Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 5,800 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.  

Revenues in 2009 were $6,585 million, a decrease of $1,850 million (22%) compared to 2008. Essentially all of our service businesses generated lower revenues in 2009, particularly at NetJets and to a lesser degree at TTI. In 2009, NetJets revenues declined $1,465 million (32%) versus 2008 due to a 77% decline in aircraft sales as well as lower flight operations revenues primarily due to a 19% decline in flight revenue hours. Revenues at TTI were 17% lower in 2009 than in 2008 which we attribute primarily to the economic recession.  

NetJets produced a pre-tax loss in 2009 of $711 million compared to pre-tax earnings of $213 million in 2008. The pre-tax loss at NetJets in 2009 included asset writedowns and other downsizing costs of $676 million compared to $54 million of such charges in 2008. NetJets owns more planes than is required for its present level of operations and plans to dispose of selected aircraft over time provided that prices are reasonable. We do not believe at this point that further downsizing will be required. We also believe, as a result of actions taken to date, that NetJets is likely to operate at a profit in 2010, assuming there is no further deterioration in the U.S. economy or negative actions directed at the ownership of private aircraft.  

Excluding the results of NetJets, our other service businesses produced pre-tax earnings of $620 million in 2009 compared to pre-tax earnings of $758 million in 2008. The negative impact of the global recession was evident on substantially all of our other service businesses.  

In 2008, revenues were $8,435 million, an increase of $643 million (8%) over 2007. The inclusion of twelve months of revenues from TTI in 2008 versus nine months in 2007 accounted for over 80% of the revenue increase. Excluding the impact of TTI, other service revenues in 2008 increased 2% over 2007. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 were $971 million, relatively unchanged from 2007. The impact from the TTI acquisition and increased earnings of FlightSafety were offset by lower earnings from NetJets and The Pampered Chef.  

Retailing  

Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and Sees Candies. Retailing revenues were $2,869 million in 2009, a decrease of $235 million (8%) compared to 2008. In 2009, our home furnishings revenues declined 7% while jewelry revenues declined 12% versus 2008. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 of $161 million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Sees Candies, Star Furniture and Nebraska Furniture Mart generated increased pre-tax earnings, while in the aggregate our jewelry businesses posted a pre-tax loss. Throughout 2008 as the impact of the economic recession in the U.S. worsened, consumer spending declined and these conditions continued in 2009.

Retailing revenues were $3,104 million in 2008, a decrease of $293 million (9%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings of $163 million in 2008 declined $111 million (41%) compared to 2007. Seven of the eight retail operations experienced revenue declines and all eight of these operations had declines in earnings compared to 2007.  

Finance and Financial Products  

A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues in 2009 of our manufactured housing and finance business (Clayton Homes) declined $303 million (9%) from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 16% decline in units sold partially offset by higher average selling prices as a result of product mix changes and a slight increase in installment loan interest and other investment income. Revenues in 2008 declined $105 million (3%) from 2007, reflecting lower revenues from home sales and was partially offset by higher installment loan interest income. Also, revenues in 2007 included approximately $90 million from the housing communities division which was sold in the first quarter of 2008. Installment loan balances were approximately $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2009, a decline of about $300 million from December 31, 2008.  

Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $187 million in 2009, a decline of $19 million (9%) from 2008. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by a $79 million increase in estimated loan loss provisions partially offset by improved margins from manufactured home sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses arising from cost reduction efforts. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 declined $320 million (61%) from 2007. Earnings in 2008 included a $125 million increase in estimated loan loss provisions, $25 million of losses arising from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $38 million in losses from asset writedowns and plant closure costs. In both years overall operating results were negatively impacted by declines in home sales, increased borrowing costs and higher levels of borrowings.  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings from our furniture/transportation equipment leasing businesses in 2009 declined $112 million (14%) and $73 million (84%), respectively, compared to 2008. The declines primarily reflected lower rental income driven by relatively low utilization rates for over-the-road trailer and storage units, and lower furniture rentals. Significant cost components of this business are fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), so earnings declined disproportionately to revenues. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for 2008 decreased $37 million (5%) and $24 million (22%), respectively, as compared to 2007, primarily for the reasons previously stated.  

Revenues and earnings of Clayton Homes and the furniture/transportation equipment leasing businesses have been negatively affected by the economic recession as well as the credit crisis. Our manufactured housing loan programs are currently at a competitive disadvantage to the traditional single family mortgage market, which is currently receiving favorable interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. Unlike site-built homes, very few factory-built homes qualify for these mortgages. This has produced a negative impact on manufactured housing construction and sales. However, even under these conditions, we believe Clayton Homes will continue to operate profitably.  

Earnings from our other finance business activities include investment income earned from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments held by certain finance subsidiaries; interest earned from a small portfolio of long-held commercial real estate loans; net interest earned from an annuity insurance business, whose earnings primarily consist of the net interest accruing on interest bearing assets and liabilities; and earnings from an interest rate spread over the cost of Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation borrowing costs charged to and reflected in Clayton Homes earnings.

Finance and Financial Products (Continued)  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings of other finance business activities in 2009 increased $55 million (9%) and $86 million (17%), respectively, due primarily to increased investment income earned from our acquisitions of higher yielding fixed maturity and equity investments, including portions of our acquisitions of Goldman Sachs and Wrigley securities.  

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses  

A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss included as components of accumulated other comprehensive income.  

The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss results in reductions in the cost basis of the investment, but not a reduction in fair value. Although we have recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings, we may continue to hold positions in most of these securities. The recognition of such losses does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur. We use no bright line tests in determining whether impairments are temporary or other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining impairment losses including the current and expected long-term business prospects of the issuer, the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers.  

Other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2009 predominantly relate to a first quarter charge with respect to our investment in ConocoPhillips common stock. The market price of ConocoPhillips shares declined sharply over the last half of 2008. In 2009, we sold over half of the ConocoPhillips position we held at the end of 2008. Since a significant portion of the decline in the market value of our investment in ConocoPhillips occurred during the last half of 2008, a significant portion of the other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were recognized in other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2008.  

Other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in 2008 (approximately $1.8 billion) were primarily related to investments in twelve equity securities. The unrealized losses in these securities generally ranged from 40% to 90% of cost. After reviewing these investments, we concluded that there was considerable uncertainty in the business prospects of these companies and thus greater uncertainty on the recoverability of the cost of the security.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

With respect to equity securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2009 and where other-than-temporary impairments were not recorded at December 31, 2009, approximately 90% of the losses were concentrated in four issuers. Unrealized losses were no greater than 30% of cost. In our judgment, the future earnings potential and underlying business economics of these companies are favorable and as of December 31, 2009, we possessed the ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover. Changing market conditions and other facts and circumstances may change the business prospects of these issuers as well as our ability and intent to hold these securities until the prices recover. Accordingly, we may record other-than-temporary impairment charges in future periods with respect to one or more of these securities.  

Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. We do not view the periodic gains or losses from the changes in fair value as meaningful given the volatile nature of equity and credit markets over short periods of time, particularly with respect to equity index put option contracts.  

The fair values of our credit default contracts are impacted by changes in credit default spreads, which have been volatile in recent periods. In the first quarter of 2009, we increased our estimates of credit default liabilities, which produced a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.35 billion. This loss resulted from several corporate defaults and the widening of credit default spreads, primarily with respect to the underlying non-investment grade issuers included in our high yield contracts. These non-investment grade issuers are typically highly leveraged and therefore dependent on having ongoing access to the capital markets. The freezing of the credit markets in late 2008 and early 2009 was particularly detrimental to these issuers. As a result, there were a number of defaults in 2009 and we made loss payments of approximately $1.9 billion. Over the last nine months of 2009, credit default spreads narrowed significantly and the estimated values of our liabilities declined resulting in pre-tax gains of approximately $2.14 billion.  

The losses from our credit default contracts in 2008 derived primarily from increases in the fair value of our liabilities due to a significant widening of credit default spreads during the fourth quarter of 2008. The estimated fair value of credit default contracts at December 31, 2008 was $4.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2007. The year-to-date increase included fair value pre-tax losses of $1.8 billion and premiums from contracts entered into in 2008 of $633 million, partially offset by loss payments of $152 million.  

In 2009, our gains on equity index put option contracts were $2.7 billion, compared to losses of $5.0 billion in 2008. The gains in 2009 reflected increases in the underlying equity indexes ranging from approximately 19% to 23%, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar on non-U.S. contracts and lower interest rates. These factors combined to produce a decrease in our estimated liabilities. The losses in 2008 reflected declines of between 30% and 45% in underlying indexes. During the fourth quarter of 2008, these indexes declined between 10% and 22%. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018. As previously noted, we do not believe that the gains or losses reflected in earnings in the past two years to be meaningful relative to evaluating our ultimate payment obligations, if any. There have been no loss payments to date.  

Financial Condition  

Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and financial strength. Our consolidated shareholders equity increased $21.8 billion during 2009 to $131.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Our consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses, was approximately $146.0 billion at December 31, 2009 (including cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 billion) and $118.9 billion at December 31, 2008 (including cash and cash equivalents of $24.3 billion). Our invested assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses.  

In 2009, we acquired a 12% convertible perpetual security issued by Swiss Re for $2.7 billion, an 8.5% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow for $3 billion and senior notes of Wrigley due in 2013 and 2014 for $1.0 billion. Investment income generated by these investments will greatly exceed income currently earned on short-term investments.

Financial Condition (Continued)  

Notes payable and other borrowings of our insurance and other businesses declined $630 million in 2009 to approximately $3.7 billion at December 31. The decline was primarily due to a combination of term debt maturities and a reduction in short-term borrowings.  

On February 12, 2010, we completed the acquisition of BNSF by acquiring the outstanding shares of BNSF that we did not already own for aggregate consideration of approximately $26.5 billion ($100 per BNSF share). The aggregate consideration consisted of a combination of $15.9 billion in cash and about 95,000 equivalent Class A shares of Berkshire common stock. In connection with the BNSF acquisition, we issued $8.0 billion aggregate par amount of senior notes consisting of $2.0 billion par amount of notes due in 2011; $1.7 billion par amount of notes due in 2012; $2.6 billion par amount of notes due in 2013; and $1.7 billion par amount of notes due in 2015. In connection with its railroad operations, BNSF regularly issues debt to finance capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes. We expect this practice to continue after our acquisition. As of December 31, 2009, BNSF had debt outstanding of about $10.3 billion. We do not intend to provide guarantees on BNSF debt outstanding at the acquisition date or issued in the future.  

Capital expenditures of our utilities and energy businesses in 2009 were approximately $3.4 billion and are currently forecasted to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2010. We expect MidAmerican and its operating subsidiaries to fund future capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. MidAmericans borrowings were $19.6 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $434 million from December 31, 2008. MidAmerican and its operating subsidiaries currently have no significant debt maturities until 2011, when about $1.1 billion matures. We have committed until February 28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by MidAmerican or any of its subsidiaries.  

Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equivalents, were approximately $29.0 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $27.1 billion at December 31, 2008. Our finance and financial products liabilities were $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $30.7 billion at December 31, 2008. The decline in liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $5.3 billion in derivative contract liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, notes payable and other borrowings of $14.6 billion included approximately $12.1 billion par amount of medium-term notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire. The BHFC notes that were outstanding at December 31, 2009, are unsecured and mature at various dates between 2010 and 2018. The proceeds from the medium-term notes were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2010, BHFC repaid $1.5 billion of its maturing notes and issued new notes consisting of $250 million par amount due in 2012 and $750 million par amount due in 2040.  

During 2008 and continuing into the first part of 2009, access to credit markets became limited as a consequence of the worldwide credit crisis. As a result, interest rates for investment grade corporate issuers increased relative to government obligations, even for companies with strong credit histories and ratings. However, we believe that the credit crisis has abated and interest rates for investment grade issuers relative to government obligations have declined. Nevertheless, restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations, particularly the utilities and energy and the finance and financial products operations. We believe we currently maintain ample liquidity to cover our existing contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity needs.  

Contractual Obligations  

We regularly enter into contracts, which obligate us to make cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Contractual obligations arise under financing and other agreements, which are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in our financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.  

The obligations of our insurance businesses to make payments of losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table were

Contractual Obligations (Continued)  

 estimated based upon past claim settlement activities and therefore are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding our critical accounting policies. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses are ceded to and recoverable from others under reinsurance contracts, such recoverables are not reflected in the table.  

A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 follows. Amounts are in millions.

Critical Accounting Policies  

Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in our financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in our financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available.  

Property and casualty losses  

A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail.

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used.

As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails.  

Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders.  

We utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding reserving processes of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.  

GEICO  

GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2009 were $8,561 million. As of December 31, 2009, gross reserves included $6,187 million of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2,374 million of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting the setting of our reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity), which includes loss adjustment expenses.  

Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate.  

Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows.  

We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are established as a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which our claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.  

Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known.  

For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2009, case development reserves averaged approximately 20% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically.  

For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop

GEICO (Continued)  

 age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management.  

For each of GEICOs major coverages, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.  

Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2008 developed downward by $194 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2009, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2009. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 1% of earned premiums in 2009 and approximately 2.6% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2009 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated.  

Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 90% of GEICOs reserves as of December 31, 2009 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (BI) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $124 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.  

Our exposure in GEICO to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICOs total reserves (approximately 2%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant.  

General Re and BHRG  

Property and casualty loss reserves of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured.  

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess contracts or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. Loss information from aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.  

Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client periodic reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re and BHRG (Continued)  

The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance.  

Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays.  

Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow us to have access to the cedants books and records with respect to the subject business and provide us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem them appropriate.  

In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under the reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  

In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurance due to the factors previously discussed.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re (Continued)  

The discussion that follows describes our process of establishing loss reserve estimates at General Re. Our loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period.  

We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because we believe that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail.  

Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2009, ACRs aggregated $3.0 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2009, we conducted about 330 claim reviews.  

Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business.  

We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.  

We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios.  

We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.  

In 2009, for prior years workers compensation losses, our reported claims were less than expected claims by about $186 million. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated about $133 million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported

 occurrences. After deducting $148 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, workers compensation losses from prior years reduced pre-tax earnings in 2009 by $95 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $704 million and $408 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2009. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were favorable in 2009 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $922 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $922 million.  

Our property losses were lower than expected in 2009 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $17 million.  

In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $220 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.7 billion gross and $1.3 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2008. Mass tort net claims paid were about $87 million in 2009. In 2009, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $83 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claims payments made over the last three years was approximately 14.5 years as of December 31, 2009. The insurance industrys comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 8 years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.

BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2009 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A discussion of our loss reserve estimation processes used by our BHRG underwriting unit follows. In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change.  

As of December 31, 2009, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominantly casualty losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion in 2009. The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of case reserves. We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract.  

In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2009, retroactive reserves developed upward by approximately $420 million.  

Our liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and $9.2 billion at December 31, 2008. We paid losses in 2009 attributable to these exposures of approximately $600 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future.  

The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies are not expected to exceed approximately $29 billion as of December 31, 2009. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that unpaid losses as of December 31, 2009 ($18.0 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009, a decline of about $200 million from December 31, 2008. In 2009 and 2008, loss reserves for prior years events declined by approximately $280 million and $200 million, respectively, which produced corresponding increases to pre-tax earnings each year. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.  

Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by managements judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared.  

Derivative contract liabilities  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. For these reasons, we classify our credit default and equity index put option contracts as Level 3 measurements under GAAP.  

The fair values of our high yield credit default contracts are primarily based on indications of bid/ask pricing data. The bid/ask data represents non-binding indications of prices for which similar contracts would be exchanged. Pricing data for the high yield index contracts is obtained from one to three sources depending on the particular index. For the single name and municipal issuer credit default contracts, our fair values are generally based on credit default spread information obtained from a widely used reporting source. We monitor and review pricing data for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We generally base estimated fair value on the ask prices (the average of such prices if more than one indication is obtained). We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data referred to above. Further, we make no significant adjustments to fair value for non-performance risk. We concluded that the values produced from this data (without adjustment) reasonably represented the value for which we could have transferred these liabilities. However, our contract terms (particularly the lack of collateral posting requirements) likely preclude any transfer of the contracts to third parties. Accordingly, prices in a current actual settlement or transfer could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently we do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow our credit default contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates.  

Pricing data for newer high yield credit default contracts tends to vary little among the different pricing sources, which we believe indicates that trading of such contracts is relatively active. As contracts age towards their expiration dates, the variations in pricing data can widen, which we believe is indicative of less active markets. However, the impact of such variations is partially mitigated by shorter remaining durations, lower exposures due to losses paid to date and by the relatively greater

 availability of data on newer contracts, which is used for comparison. We entered into one credit default contract in 2009, while several contracts expired or terminated. Accordingly, our remaining risk under credit default contracts has declined from year end 2008.  

We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, discount rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average discount and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2009 were 4.0% and 2.7%, respectively, and were each approximately 4.0% as of December 31, 2008. The discount rates as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately 55 basis points and 125 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented an estimate of the spread between our borrowing rates and the benchmark rates for comparable durations. The spread adjustments were based on spreads for our obligations and obligations for comparably rated issuers. We believe the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. For additional information, see our Market Risk Disclosures.  

The Black-Scholes model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 22%, which was relatively unchanged from year end 2008. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract is based upon the implied volatility at the inception of each equity index put option contract. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2009 ($7.3 billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions.

Other Critical Accounting Policies  

We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $34.0 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted an annual review in the fourth quarter. Such tests include determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and performing goodwill impairment tests. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may involve forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss.

Market Risk Disclosures  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility, particularly over the short term. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.  

Interest Rate Risk  

We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. We utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis.  

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments.  

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk  

Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2009, approximately 60% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in five investees.  

We prefer to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term equity price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility.  

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.  

We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception and may not be settled before their respective expiration dates.  

The following table summarizes our equity investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates is also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk  

We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the consolidated financial statements. Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company.

Foreign Currency Risk (Continued)  

Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of certain U.S. subsidiaries as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.  

Commodity Price Risk  

Through our ownership of MidAmerican, we are subject to commodity price risk. Exposures include variations in the price of wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, fuel costs to generate electricity and natural gas supply for regulated retail gas customers. Electricity and natural gas prices are subject to wide price swings as demand responds to, among many other items, changing weather, limited storage, transmission and transportation constraints, and lack of alternative supplies from other areas. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results may be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities.  

The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.
