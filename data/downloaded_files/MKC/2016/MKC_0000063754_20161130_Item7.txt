ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick & Company, Incorporated, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the MD&A are in millions, except per share data.

McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and industrial, as described in Item 1 of this report.

Our long-term annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase operating income 7% to 9% and increase earnings per share 9% to 11%. Over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business–driven by brand marketing support, customer intimacy, expanded distribution and category growth; 2) product innovation; and 3) acquisitions. We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our CCI program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization, as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements. In addition to funding brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives, our CCI program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share. 

Our business generates strong cash flow, and we have a balanced use of cash. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 31 years, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. Each year, we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2% to earnings per share growth.

In 2016, we achieved further growth of our business although sales and earnings reported in U.S. dollars were unfavorably impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the resultant unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, as compared to 2015. Net sales rose 2.7% over the 2015 level, as a result of the following factors:

•We grew volume and product mix, with similar increases in both our consumer and industrial segments. This added 1.7% of sales growth. The increases were driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution including new retail channels and new geographic regions. 

•Pricing actions to offset a low-single digit increase in material cost inflation added 1.5% of the increase in net sales. 

•The incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 added 2.3% of the increase in net sales. 

•These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency rates. This impact reduced the net sales growth rate by 2.8%. Excluding this impact, we grew sales 5.5% on a constant currency basis. 

Operating income was $641.0 million in 2016 and $548.4 million in 2015. We recorded $16.0 million of special charges in 2016 related to organization and streamlining actions, and in 2015 recorded $65.5 million of special charges. In 2016 compared to the year-ago period, the favorable impact of higher sales and $109.0 million of cost savings from our CCI program and organization and streamlining actions more than offset higher material costs and an $11.6 million increase in brand marketing. Excluding the aforementioned special charges, adjusted operating income was $657.0 million, an increase of 7% compared to $613.9 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 9%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 

Diluted earnings per share was $3.69 in 2016 and $3.11 in 2015. The year-on-year increase in earnings per share was driven mainly by higher operating income, which reflected lower special charges, and lower shares outstanding. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.09 and $0.37 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.78 in 2016 and $3.48 in 2015. This was an increase of 9%, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 

McCormick continues to generate strong cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities reached $658.1 million in 2016, an increase from $590.0 million in 2015. We continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2016, that return of cash to our shareholders was $460.5 million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2016 COMPARED TO 2015

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for the fiscal year 2016 increased 2.7% from 2015 and by 5.5% on a constant currency basis (that is, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Both the consumer and industrial segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 1.7% to sales. This was driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution. Pricing actions, taken in response to increased material costs, added 1.5% to sales. The incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2016–mainly Gourmet Garden–and three acquisitions completed in 2015–Brand Aromatics, Drogheria & Alimentari (D&A) and Stubb’s–added 2.3% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange that reduced sales by 2.8% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 5.5% on a constant currency basis.

In 2017, we expect to grow sales 3% to 5%, with further increases in volume and product mix and pricing actions to offset a projected increase in material costs. We also expect incremental sales from the acquisition of Gourmet Garden, completed during fiscal year 2016, and an industrial acquisition completed in December 2016 and described in note 19 to our financial statements. We anticipate that these sales increases will be offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange during 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2016, gross profit rose 110 basis points to 41.5% from 40.4% in 2015, as the favorable impact of pricing actions, CCI-led cost savings and more favorable business mix more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs. In 2017, we expect gross profit margin to range from comparable to approximately 50 basis points higher than 2016, due to the favorable impact of pricing actions and cost savings, net of the unfavorable impact of higher material costs. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,175.0 million in 2016 compared to $1,127.4 million in 2015, an increase of $47.6 million. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 26.6%, a 40 basis point increase from 2015. Driving this increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales were higher employee related expenses, an $11.6 million increase in our brand marketing from the 2015 level to $252.2 million in 2016 and a $6.5 million increase in transaction costs, related to both completed and uncompleted acquisitions, from the 2015 level to $13.4 million in 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were cost savings from CCI and from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements. Special charges of $16.0 million were recorded in 2016 and $65.5 million in 2015 to enable us to implement these changes. Of the $16.0 million of special charges recorded in 2016, $0.3 million were recorded in cost of goods sold. The 2016 special charges principally consist of $5.7 million related to our EMEA reorganization, which began in 2015, $2.8 million related to our exit from a consolidated joint venture in South Africa, $1.9 million for other exit costs related to the discontinuance of non-profitable product lines of our Kohinoor business in India initiated in 2015, $1.8 million associated with actions in connection with our planned exit of two leased manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Thailand, and $1.7 million for employee severance actions related to our North American effectiveness initiative begun in 2015. See note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges.

In 2015, we recorded special charges of $65.5 million, of which $29.2 million related to employee severance and related costs associated with our North American effectiveness initiative and $24.4 million related to a reorganization of our EMEA business. An additional $14.2 million, including a non-cash brand impairment charge of $9.6 million, related to the discontinuance by our Kohinoor consumer business in India of sales of non-profitable bulk-packaged and broken basmati rice product lines. Partially offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million for the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of special charges in 2014 and 2013. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense for 2016 was higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Other income, net for 2016 rose by $3.1 million over the 2015 level, primarily due to higher interest income and lower non-operating foreign currency losses, both as compared to 2015, as well as to a gain on the 2016 sale of a non-operating asset.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate decreased 50 basis points to 26.0% in 2016, from 26.5% in 2015, primarily as a result of the following factors. Net discrete tax benefits increased by $2.0 million, from $19.1 million in 2015 to $21.1 million in 2016. Both 2016 and 2015 included discrete tax benefits for (i) the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, net of additional taxes provided, for the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions, (ii) the reversal of valuation allowances on non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets, and (iii) prior year adjustments for the research tax credit related to legislation enacted subsequent to the reporting dates. A portion of the 2015 discrete tax benefit was offset by a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the U.K resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 reducing the statutory tax rate for future periods. See note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.

We expect an effective tax rate in 2017 of approximately 28%, including a favorable effect from our planned adoption of the new Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as more fully described in note 1 of the financial statements. We expect that the adoption of this new guidance in fiscal 2017 will reduce our effective income tax rate; however, the ultimate amount of that reduction is dependent upon the underlying vesting or exercise activity and related future stock prices. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Income from unconsolidated operations decreased $0.6 million in 2016 from the prior year. This decrease was mainly attributable to our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, for which the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates more than offset the favorable impact, in local currency, of higher sales and net income. In 2016, our 50% interest in the McCormick de Mexico joint venture represented 57% of the sales and 83% of the income of our unconsolidated operations. We own 50% of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures. 

In 2017, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be comparable to 2016, mainly due to the continued unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on McCormick de Mexico.

We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.69 in 2016, compared to $3.11 in 2015. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2015 to 2016. The increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2016. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as these activities are managed separately from the business segments. 

Consumer Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We grew sales of our consumer segment by 4.5% as compared to 2015 and by 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.7% to sales, and pricing actions, taken in response to increased material costs, added 1.2%. The incremental impact in 2016 of acquisitions completed in that year–mainly Gourmet Garden–and two acquisitions completed in 2015–Drogheria & Alimentari (D&A) and Stubb’s–added 3.5% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced consumer segment sales by 1.9% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.4% on a constant currency basis. 

In the Americas, consumer sales rose 5.8% in 2016 as compared to 2015 and rose by 6.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.2% to sales, led by U.S. sales growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes and driven by product innovation, brand marketing, particularly in digital, and working with retailers on in-store product assortment, pricing and promotion. Pricing actions added 1.4% to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions–mainly Gourmet Garden and Stubb's–added 2.7% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact of foreign currency that reduced sales by 0.5% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.3% on a constant currency basis.

In the EMEA region, consumer sales rose 2.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015 and rose 6.9% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix lowered sales by 0.4%, with growth in Poland and France offset by weakness in the U.K. The sales growth in Poland and France was driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution, while weakness in the U.K. related to a difficult retail environment. Pricing added 1.5% to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions–mainly D&A–added 5.8% to sales. An unfavorable impact from 

foreign currency rates reduced sales by 4.5% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.9% on a constant currency basis.

In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 1.5% as compared to 2015 and increased 6.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.2% to sales, with strong results in both China and Australia. Volume and product mix in India declined in 2016 compared to 2015, due in part to the discontinuation of lower-margin bulk-packaged and broken rice product lines. Pricing added 0.3% to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions–Gourmet Garden–added 3.8% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 4.8% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.3% on a constant currency basis.

We grew operating income, excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our consumer segment by $34.7 million, or 7.6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and an increase in brand marketing. On a constant currency basis, operating income, excluding special charges rose 8.7%. Excluding the impact of special charges, the consumer segment operating income margin rose by 50 basis points to 17.8% in 2016 from 17.3% in 2015.

Industrial Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our industrial business declined 0.2% as compared to 2015 but increased by 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.5% to sales and pricing actions, taken in response to increased material costs, added 2.0%. The incremental impact on 2016 industrial sales of the Brand Aromatics acquisition completed in 2015 added 0.4% to sales. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced industrial segment sales by 4.1% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 3.9% on a constant currency basis.

In the Americas, industrial sales rose 1.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015 and rose 3.7% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.4% to sales and included growth in sales of branded foodservice products in the U.S. and snack seasonings in the U.S. and Mexico. Pricing actions added 1.7% to sales and the incremental impact of the Brand Aromatics acquisition added 0.6% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced sales by 2.0% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 3.7% on a constant currency basis.

In the EMEA region, industrial sales declined 6.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015, but increased 4.8% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.1% to sales and included growth in sales to leading quick service restaurants in this region. Pricing actions added 3.7% to sales. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 11.2% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 4.8% on a constant currency basis.

In the Asia/Pacific region, industrial sales declined 0.1% in 2016 as compared to 2015, but increased by 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 3.0% to sales and included growth in sales to leading quick service restaurants supplied from our facilities in both Australia and Southeast Asia that offset weakness in China that resulted, in large part, from a decision by a large customer to add a secondary supply source. Pricing actions added 0.8% to sales. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 3.9% compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 3.8% on a constant currency basis.

We grew operating income, excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our industrial segment by $8.4 million, or 5.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs. On a constant currency basis, operating income, excluding special charges rose 11.6%. Excluding the impact of special charges, the industrial segment operating income margin rose by 50 basis points to 10.0% in 2016 from 9.5% in 2015 and included the impact of our efforts to shift our business mix to more value-added products through innovation and acquisitions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2015 COMPARED TO 2014

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for the fiscal year 2015 increased by 1.3% from 2014 and by 6.4% on a constant currency basis, with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments. Higher volume and product mix added 3.9% to sales, driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution including new retail channels and new geographic regions. Pricing actions, taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs, added 1.1% to sales. The incremental impact of the three acquisitions completed in 2015–Brand Aromatics, Drogheria & Alimentari (D&A) and Stubb’s–added 1.4% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced 2015 sales compared to 2014 by 5.1% and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2015, gross profit was comparable to 2014. Gross profit margin declined 40 basis points from the 2014 level to 40.4%. This decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the impact of a mid-single digit increase in material costs, partially offset by cost savings and pricing actions. In 2015, CCI cost savings, as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements, totaled $98 million, of which $66 million lowered cost of goods sold. Lower gross profit from our Kohinoor business in India also impacted gross profit margin in 2015, and, as a result, toward the end of 2015 we decided to discontinue the lower margin bulk-packaged and broken rice product lines of our Kohinoor business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,127.4 million in 2015 compared to $1,122.0 million in 2014, an increase of $5.4 million. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 26.2%, a 30 basis point reduction from 2014. Driving this reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales were cost savings from CCI and from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements, as well as the benefit of higher sales, partly offset by higher benefits expense and a $14 million increase in our brand marketing from the 2014 level to $240.6 million in 2015. In connection with our acquisitions of Brand Aromatics, D&A and Stubb’s, we incurred $3.6 million of transaction costs, which were included in SG&A. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Special charges of $65.5 million were recorded in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 to enable us to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness. Of the $65.5 million of special charges recorded in 2015, $4.0 million were recorded in cost of goods sold. Of that $65.5 million, $29.2 million related to employee severance and related costs associated with our North American effectiveness initiative, and $24.4 million related to our EMEA reorganization initiated earlier in 2015. An additional $14.2 million related to our Kohinoor consumer business in India. Partially offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million for the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of special charges in 2014 and 2013. See note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges. 

In 2014, we recorded special charges of $2.1 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the EMEA reorganization announced in late 2013, $1.3 million related to the realignment of certain manufacturing activities in the U.S. industrial business, $1.1 million related to the elimination of certain administrative positions in the U.S. consumer and industrial businesses, and $0.7 million related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in the Australian consumer business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense for 2015 was higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher average borrowings. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate increased 20 basis points to 26.5% in 2015, from 26.3% in 2014, primarily as a result of the following factors. Net discrete tax benefits increased by $8.3 million, from $10.8 million in 2014 to $19.1 million in 2015. Both 2015 and 2014 included reversals of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, net of additional taxes provided, for various income tax audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions. In addition, 2015 included a net discrete tax benefit for (i) the reversal of valuation allowances on non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets, and (ii) a prior year adjustment for the 2014 research tax credit related to legislation enacted in 2015, offset by (iii) a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the U.K. resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 which reduced the U.K. statutory tax rate in future periods. The increase in net discrete tax benefits in 2015, as compared to 2014, was more than offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015. That unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015, as compared to the prior year, resulted from the higher percentage of U.S. pre-tax earnings in 2015 that are taxed at a federal statutory rate of 35% as well as an increase in non-U.S. losses in jurisdictions where income tax benefits could not be recognized as it is more likely than not that the resultant deferred tax assets will not be realized. See note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Income from unconsolidated operations rose $7.3 million in 2015 from the prior year, which was a 24.8% increase, despite the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. This increase is attributable to our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, which achieved higher sales and an increase in gross margin percentage. In 2015, our 50% interest in the McCormick de Mexico joint venture represented 60% of the sales and 89% of the income of our unconsolidated operations. We own 50% of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures. 

We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.11 in 2015, compared to $3.34 in 2014. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2014 to 2015. The increase in adjusted operating income and increase in income from unconsolidated operations in the table below includes a significant impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2015. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as these activities are managed separately from the business segments. 

Consumer Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our consumer segment increased 0.4% as compared to 2014 and increased 5.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 3.8% to consumer sales and higher pricing related to material cost changes added 0.1%. Our acquisitions of D&A and Stubb’s, during the second and third quarters, respectively, added 1.4% to sales in 2015. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced consumer sales by 4.9% compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 5.3% on a constant currency basis. 

In the Americas, consumer sales rose 1.8% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and rose 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix increased sales by 2.4% and pricing added 0.5%. Higher volume and product mix was led by U.S. sales growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes. This is an improvement over the 2014 sales results and was driven by product innovation, brand marketing, particularly in digital, and our work with retailers on in-store product assortment, pricing and promotion. The acquisition of Stubb’s, which closed in August 2015, added 0.3% to sales in 2015. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 1.4% from the 2014 level and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

In the EMEA region, consumer sales decreased 5.0% as compared to 2014, but increased by 10.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix increased sales by 4.7% as compared to 2014 and higher pricing added 0.3%. The acquisition of D&A, which closed in May 2015, added 5.3% to sales in 2015. Our core business growth in the EMEA region was led by Poland, France and Russia and driven by our higher brand marketing, new product innovation and expanded distribution. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 15.3% compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 2.6% as compared to 2014 and increased by 6.6% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix increased sales by 8.3% as compared to 2014 but were partly offset by a 1.7% reduction from pricing. In 2015, sales in China increased at a double-digit rate due in part to expanded distribution, while sales in India declined due in part to the discontinuation of lower-margin bulk-packaged and broken rice product lines, as well as lower pricing on basmati rice. The net effect of these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 4.0% compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

Operating income, excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our consumer segment decreased $18.2 million, or 3.8%, compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, operating income for 2015, excluding special charges, decreased 0.4%, with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings, offset by the unfavorable impact of higher material costs, increased employee benefit expense and a 4% increase in brand marketing. The decrease in operating income led to lower operating income margin. Excluding the impact of special charges, the consumer segment operating income margin was 17.3% in 2015 and 18.1% in 2014.

Industrial Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our industrial segment increased by 2.7% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased by 8.2% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 4.3% to sales as compared to 2014 and higher pricing related to material cost changes added 2.6%. Our acquisition of Brand Aromatics in March 2015 added 1.3% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced sales by 5.5% from the 2014 level and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

In the Americas, industrial sales rose 3.2% as compared to 2014 and increased by 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix increased sales by 1.3% compared to 2014 and higher pricing increased sales by 3.1%. Higher volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in both the U.S. and Mexico, as well as branded foodservice products in the U.S. The acquisition of Brand Aromatics added 2.0% to industrial sales in the Americas in 2015. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 3.2% as compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

In the EMEA region, industrial sales increased by 0.8% as compared to 2014 and increased by 12.6% on a constant currency basis. Sales in 2015 reflected an increase of 10.4% attributable to higher volume and product mix and 2.2% from higher pricing. The strong sales performance reflected our support for the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 11.8% from the 2014 level and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

In the Asia/Pacific region, industrial sales increased 2.9% as compared to 2014 and increased by 10.2% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix increased sales by 9.9% as compared to the prior year and higher pricing increased sales by 0.3%. In 2015, we increased sales to quick service restaurant customers in China and other markets across this region. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 7.3% as compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis.

Operating income, excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our industrial segment increased $23.9 million, or 17.8%, compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, operating income for 2015, excluding special charges, increased 24.5% above 2014, with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and increased employee benefit expense. The significant increase in operating income led to higher operating income margin. Excluding the impact of special charges, the industrial segment operating income margin was 9.5% in 2015 and 8.3% in 2014. This also reflects a shift in the business mix to more value-added products, including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each excluding the impact of special charges in 2016, 2015 and 2014. These represent non-GAAP financial measures, which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned “special charges” in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million and $4.0 million in cost of goods sold in our income statements for 2016 and 2015, respectively, which we classified as special charges.

Special charges consist of expenses, including related impairment charges, associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee, comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; President Global Industrial and McCormick International; President Global Consumer and North America; and Senior Vice President, Human Relations. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (including details with respect to estimated costs, which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component, such as an asset impairment, or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee’s advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. Certain ancillary expenses related to these actions approved by our Management Committee do not qualify for accrual upon approval but are included as special charges as incurred during the course of the action. Details with respect to the composition of special charges recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are important to investors. The exclusion of special charges provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. 

These non-GAAP measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner as we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions where applicable and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial results is provided below (in millions, except per share data):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) In 2016, represents the portion of the total special charge of $2.8 million, associated with our exit of a consolidated joint venture in South Africa, attributable to our former joint venture partner. In 2015, represents the portion of the Kohinoor total special charge of $14.2 million attributable to Kohinoor's 15% minority stakeholder.

(2) Total special charges of $16.0 million for 2016, $65.5 million for 2015 and $5.2 million for 2014 are net of taxes of $3.0 million, $15.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. 

Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis”, is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).

Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year. The tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows: (1) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2016 on a constant currency basis, net sales and adjusted operating income for 2016 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2015 and compared to the reported results for 2015; and (2) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2015 on a constant currency basis, net sales and operating income for 2015 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2014 and compared to the reported results for 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition to the above non-GAAP measures, we use total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a measure of leverage. We define EBITDA as net income plus expenses of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are both non-GAAP financial measures. This ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations. Our target for total debt to EBITDA is 1.5 to 1.8. Our total debt to EBITDA can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity. We believe that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. 

 The following table reconciles our EBITDA to our net income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, increase our dividend, fund capital projects and make share repurchases 

when appropriate. In 2017, we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions with cash flow from operations.

In the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet.

The reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At November 30, 2016, the exchange rates for the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty and Chinese renminbi were lower versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2015. At November 30, 2016, the exchange rate for the Australian dollar was higher versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2015. At November 30, 2016, the exchange rate for the Euro versus the U.S. dollar approximated the comparable rate at November 30, 2015.

Operating Cash Flow – Operating cash flow was $658.1 million in 2016, $590.0 million in 2015 and $503.6 million in 2014. The improvement in cash flow from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 is predominantly due to higher net income, resulting principally from higher sales and gross profit, a decrease in cash payments related to special charges and the impact of higher employee benefit accruals. The improvement in cash flow from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to improvements in the three main components of working capital (trade accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable). The change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years, as it was a use of cash in 2016, a source of cash in 2015 and a use of cash in 2014. While the change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations, it was a less significant use of cash in 2015 when compared to 2016 and 2014. The change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in 2016 and 2015, compared to a moderate use of cash in 2014. Dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates were higher in 2016 and 2015 when compared to 2014, contributing to the increased cash flow from operations in 2016 and 2015. 

In addition to operating cash flow, we also use cash conversion cycle (CCC) to measure our working capital management. This metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. CCC is a calculation of the number of days, on average, that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources, such as raw materials, to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. Our goal is to lower our CCC over time. We calculate CCC as follows:

Days sales outstanding (average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales) plus days in inventory (average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold) less days payable outstanding (average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory).

The following table outlines our cash conversion cycle (in days) over the last three years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in CCC in 2016 from 2015 is mainly due to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers. The decrease in CCC in 2015 from 2014 is mainly due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding resulting from new contractual terms with a large customer. 

Investing Cash Flow – Net cash used in investing activities was $267.1 million in 2016, $338.9 million in 2015 and $131.6 million in 2014. The variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses, which amounted to $120.6 million in 2016 and $210.9 million in 2015. We did not make any acquisitions in 2014. See note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to the 2016 and 2015 acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $153.8 million in 2016, $128.4 million in 2015 and $132.7 million in 2014. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to range between $170 million and $190 million to support our growth. 

Financing Cash Flow – Net cash used in financing activities was $371.5 million in 2016, $199.6 million in 2015 and $348.9 million in 2014. The variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase activity, described below, and of changes in our net borrowings. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our net borrowing activity provided cash of $55.7 million, $118.0 million and $56.1 million, respectively. In 2015, we received net cash proceeds of $246.5 million from our issuance of $250 million of 3.25% notes due 2025. The net proceeds from this offering were used to pay down short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes in 2015. In 2016, proceeds from short-term 

borrowings were used to pay off $200 million of 5.20% notes that matured in December 2015 and for general corporate purposes. 

The following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of November 30, 2016, $327 million remained of a $600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors in March 2015. 

The common stock issued in 2016, 2015 and 2014 relates to our stock compensation plans.

Our dividend history over the past three years is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In November 2016, the Board of Directors approved a 9.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.43 to $0.47 per share. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in our total debt to EBITDA from 2015 to 2016 is due to higher net income. EBITDA used in the 2016 calculation is $97.9 million higher than the EBITDA used in the 2015 calculation. EBITDA for 2015 was lower, in part, due to the impact of a higher level of special charges. The increase in our total debt to EBITDA from 2014 to 2015 is mainly due to higher long-term debt borrowings in 2015 to fund our acquisitions of Brand Aromatics, D&A and Stubb’s, combined with the lower EBITDA for 2015. Special charges were $16.0 million, $65.5 million and $5.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Those special charges reduced EBITDA and, accordingly, increased the ratios of total debt to EBITDA for 2016, 2015 and 2014 shown in the preceding table by 0.03, 0.16 and 0.01, respectively. 

Most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and future acquisitions. At November 30, 2016, we temporarily used $218.9 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the U.S. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 were $603.8 million and $546.0 million, respectively. The total average debt outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,658.8 million and $1,571.9 million, respectively.

See notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions.

Credit and Capital Markets – The following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business:

CREDIT FACILITIES – Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We also rely on our revolving credit facility, or borrowings backed by this facility, to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements. 

In June 2015, we entered into a five-year $750 million revolving credit facility which will expire in June 2020. The pricing for this credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is LIBOR plus 0.75%. We generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. The facility is made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. In addition to our committed revolving credit facility, we have uncommitted credit facilities for $182.8 million as of November 30, 2016 that will expire in 2017. We engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. See also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements. We believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations.

PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS – We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash payments to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $25.1 million in 2016, $15.7 million in 2015 and $16.8 million in 2014. It is expected that the 2017 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $13 million primarily for international plans. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan’s liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 65% of assets are invested in equities, 26% in fixed income investments and 9% in other investments. Assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of 50% in equities and 50% in fixed income investments. See also note 10 of the financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding.

CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES – See the subsequent section of this discussion under Market Risk Sensitivity–Credit Risk.

ACQUISITIONS

Acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits. 

On December 15, 2016 (after our fiscal year end), we purchased 100% of the shares of Enrico Giotti SpA (Giotti), a leading European flavor manufacturer located in Italy, for a cash payment of $125.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. Giotti is well known in the industry for its innovative beverage, sweet, savory and dairy flavor applications. Our acquisition of Giotti in fiscal 2017 expands the breadth of value-added products for McCormick's industrial segment, including additional expertise in flavoring health and nutrition products.

In fiscal year 2016, we made the following acquisitions:

•On April 19, 2016, we completed the purchase of 100% of the shares of Botanical Food Company, Pty Ltd, owner of the Gourmet Garden brand of packaged herbs (Gourmet Garden), a privately held company based in Australia. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in chilled convenient packaged herbs. Gourmet Garden's products complement our existing branded herb portfolio with the addition of chilled convenient herbs located in the perimeter of the grocery store. We plan to drive sales of the Gourmet Garden brand by expanding global distribution and building awareness with increased brand investment. The purchase price was $116.2 million, net of cash acquired of $3.3 million, and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Gourmet Garden has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition. While this business has an industrial component, the industrial component is not currently material to its overall business. 

•On September 1, 2016, we acquired the Cajun Injector business for $4.4 million. Cajun Injector has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition. 

In fiscal year 2015, we made the following acquisitions:

•We purchased 100% of the shares of Brand Aromatics, a privately held company located in the U.S. Brand Aromatics is a supplier of natural savory flavors, marinades, and broth and stock concentrates to the packaged food industry. Its addition expanded the breadth of value-added products in our industrial segment. The purchase price for Brand Aromatics was $62.4 million, net of post-closing adjustments and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Brand Aromatics has been included in our industrial segment since its acquisition.

•We purchased 100% of the shares of D&A, a privately held company based in Italy, and a leader of the spice and seasoning category in Italy that supplies both branded and private label products to consumers. The purchase price for D&A consisted of a cash payment of $49.0 million, net of cash acquired of $2.8 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. In addition, the purchase agreement calls for a potential earn out payment in 2018 of up to €35 million, based upon the performance of the acquired business in 2017. D&A has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition.

•We purchased 100% of the shares of One World Foods, Inc., owner of the Stubb's brand of barbeque products (Stubb's), a privately held company located in Austin, Texas. Stubb's is a leading premium barbeque sauce brand in the U.S. In addition to sauces, Stubb's products include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Its addition expanded the breadth of value-added products in our consumer segment. The purchase price for Stubb's was $99.4 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Stubb's has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition.

See notes 2 and 19 of the financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH—SHAREHOLDER RETURN

The following line graph compares the yearly change in McCormick’s cumulative total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) on McCormick’s Non-Voting Common Stock with (1) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Price Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends, and (2) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s Packaged Foods & Meats Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements.

Foreign Exchange Risk – We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee and Thai baht, as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks.

During 2016, the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in France, the U.K., Poland, Mexico, Canada and Australia. We did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates.

The following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at November 30, 2016. All contracts are valued in U.S. dollars using year-end 2016 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2016

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We had a number of smaller contracts at November 30, 2016 with an aggregate notional value of $23.4 million to purchase or sell other currencies, such as the Swiss franc and the Thai baht. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $(0.4) million at November 30, 2016.

Included in the table are $189.4 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than seven days that are used to hedge short-term cash flow funding. Remaining contracts have durations of one to 12 months.

At November 30, 2015, we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Polish zloty with a notional value of $264.5 million, all of which matured in 2016. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $2.7 million at November 30, 2015.

Interest Rate Risk – Our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees, by fiscal year of maturity at November 30, 2016. For foreign currency-denominated debt, the information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents. Variable interest rates are based on the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented.

YEARS OF MATURITY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2016

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value, interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees. Interest rate swaps have the following effects:

•We issued $250 million of 5.75% notes due in December 2017 in December 2007. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 6.25%. 

•We issued $250 million of 3.90% notes due in 2021 in July 2011. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 4.01%. 

•We issued $250 million of 3.50% notes due in 2023 in August 2013. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.30%. 

•We issued $250 million of 3.25% notes due in 2025 in November 2015. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.45%. The fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 3.25% notes due in December 2025 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025. Net interest payments are based on 3 month LIBOR plus 1.22% during this period. 

Commodity Risk – We purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. In 2016, our most significant raw materials were pepper, dairy products, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), garlic, onion, rice, wheat flour and vanilla. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business.

Credit Risk – The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. We feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of November 30, 2016:

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS DUE BY YEAR

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The contingent consideration liability outstanding as of November 30, 2016 represents the estimated fair value of a contractual earn out provision associated with our acquisition of D&A. As more fully described in note 2 of the financial statements, the D&A purchase agreement calls for a potential earn out payment in 2018 of up to €35 million, based upon the performance of the acquired business in 

2017. Changes in the fair value of this liability, including any increase or decrease to our estimate of the ultimate payout, determined under the contractual provisions, and accretion of interest on the discounted liability, will occur prior to the ultimate payment in 2018.

(b)Raw material purchase obligations outstanding as of year-end may not be indicative of outstanding obligations throughout the year due to our response to varying raw material cycles.

(c)Other purchase obligations primarily consist of advertising media commitments and electricity contracts.

The contractual cash obligations table above does not reflect any estimated lease payment obligation with respect to a 15-year lease for a headquarters building in Hunt Valley, Maryland, which was entered into in July 2016. The lease, which is expected to commence upon completion of building construction and fit-out, currently scheduled for the second half of 2018, will require monthly lease payments of approximately $0.9 million beginning six months after lease commencement. That monthly lease payment is subject to adjustment after an initial 60-month period and thereafter on an annual basis as specified in the lease agreement. In addition, the initial $0.9 million monthly lease payment is subject to an increase in the event of agreed-upon changes to specifications related to the headquarters building. See note 6 of the financial statements for additional details.

Pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation, our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets. As a result, we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above.

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS EXPIRATION BY YEAR

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of November 30, 2016 and 2015.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

New accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. See note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

In preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:

Customer Contracts

In several of our major geographic markets, the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer contracts. These contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts, marketing allowances and performance incentives. These items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers, customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending. We routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change.

Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation

We review the carrying value of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. We also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue 

growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

Goodwill Impairment

Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate. We then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value, then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. As of November 30, 2016, we had $1,771.4 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet ($1,608.3 million in the consumer segment and $163.1 million in the industrial segment). Our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values. Accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.

Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. We calculate fair value by using a relief-from-royalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.

As of November 30, 2016, we had $312.2 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values. Excluding (i) the Kohinoor brand name that was written down to its estimated fair value in the third quarter of 2015, (ii) the brand names associated with Brand Aromatics, D&A and Stubb's that had their fair value brand valuations finalized during fiscal 2016, and (iii) the Gourmet Garden brand name preliminarily determined in fiscal 2016, the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value of our major brand names and trademarks is 40% or more as of November 30, 2016. 

Below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of November 30, 2016:

(a) Book value for the Gourmet Garden brand name as of November 30, 2016 is based on a preliminary valuation and will be adjusted upon finalization of this valuation in 2017. 

Income Taxes

We estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. At the end of each year, an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. Tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. A reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate. We believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, but tax authorities may challenge certain positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, is adequate. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. We have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In doing so, we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the 

need for a valuation allowance. Both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results. A 1% increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2017 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately $14 million. A 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2017 pension expense by approximately $8 million. 

Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. 

In 2014 the Society of Actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables resulting from studies they conducted that measured mortality rates for various groups of individuals and mortality information from the Social Security Administration. The updated mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries in 2014 reflected improved trends in longevity, and therefore increased the estimate of benefits to be received by plan participants. In 2015, the Society of Actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables that reflected updated Social Security Administration data and that reflected smaller improvements in longevity than its 2014 mortality tables.

In determining the mortality assumptions for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we have considered the updated mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries in 2014 and 2015, coupled with other mortality information from the Social Security Administration and from our consulting actuaries that we believe is more closely aligned with our industry and participant mix to develop assumptions that we believe are most representative of the characteristics of our participant populations. Our use of these updated mortality assumptions increased pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately $2 million in 2015. Based on our evaluation as of November 30, 2015, in conjunction with advice from our consulting actuaries, we determined that no further change was required to our mortality assumptions in 2015, other than the following refinement with respect to our U.S. other postretirement benefit plan. In determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our U.S. other postretirement benefit plans at November 30, 2015, we modified those mortality assumptions to reflect a headcount-weighted version of such assumptions that we believe is most representative of the characteristics of our other postretirement benefits population. The effect of this modification decreased the benefit obligation for our U.S. other postretirement benefit plan by approximately $1.7 million and had an immaterial effect on our related 2016 expense. Based on our evaluation as of November 30, 2016, in conjunction with advice from our consulting actuaries, we have updated the mortality improvement scale for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect actual data from the Social Security Administration through 2013. The effect of this modification decreased the benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $2.6 million and will have an immaterial effect on our related 2017 expense.

We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. In addition, see note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation

We estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements.
