PART I  

 Item 1. Business  

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG) was incorporated in Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by Harrison K. McCann. The Company has operated under the Interpublic name since January 1961.  

About Us  

We are one of the worlds premier advertising and marketing services companies. Our agency brands create marketing solutions on behalf of clients in every major world market. Our companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as consumer advertising and public relations to emerging services such as mobile and search engine marketing.  

The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs. Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving one agency and its client to long-term, fully-integrated campaigns created by a group of our companies working together on behalf of a client. With offices in over 100 countries, we can operate in a single region or align work globally across all major world markets.  

The role of our holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet clients needs. Based in New York City, our holding company also sets company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy, directs collaborative inter-agency programs, establishes financial management and operational controls, guides personnel policy, conducts investor relations and oversees mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we provide limited centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance, marketing information retrieval and analysis, legal services, real estate expertise, travel services, recruitment assistance, employee benefits and executive compensation management.  

To keep our company well-positioned in an evolving industry, we support our agencies talent and operational initiatives to expand high-growth capabilities and build offerings in key developing markets. When appropriate, we also develop relationships with companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for clients. In addition, we look for opportunities within our company to modernize operations through mergers, strategic alliances and the development of internal programs that encourage intra-company collaboration.  

Market Strategy  

We have taken several major strategic steps in recent years to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market.  

We operate in a media landscape that has vastly changed since the start of the decade. Media markets continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment. To stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives, we have invested in creative and strategic talent in high-growth areas and have realigned a number of our capabilities to meet market demand. At our McCann Worldgroup unit, a premier global integrated network, we have continued to invest in talent so as to upgrade the groups integrated marketing services offering at MRM, Momentum and McCann Healthcare. We combined accountable marketing and consumer advertising agencies to form the unique global offering of Draftfcb. We have taken significant actions to realign resources behind a more focused and strategic offering at Lowe in recent years. And at our marketing services group, Constituency Management Group (CMG), we continue to strengthen our public relations and events marketing specialists. We have also taken a unique approach to our media offering by installing a single management structure (Mediabrands) to oversee all media operations, while concurrently

 aligning our global media networks with our global brand agencies. This approach ensures that the ideas we develop for clients work across new and traditional media channels. Starting at the end of 2007 and continuing through 2008, this differentiated media strategy has begun to gain significant traction in the marketplace.  

Strong, multi-channel talent is vital to our long-term success as a marketing partner to our clients. The aspects of our business addressing digital media continue to evolve rapidly. In order to grow with our clients, we have accelerated our investment in digital talent, professional training and technology throughout the organization. This reflects our belief that digital marketing should not be treated as a silo, but instead, should be incorporated within all of our assets. Recruiting and developing digitally conversant talent at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is therefore an area where we continue to invest.  

To meet these changing needs of the marketplace, it is at times necessary to acquire or build specialty digital assets, such as Reprise Media (search engine marketing), The Interpublic Emerging Media Lab, HUGE (e-commerce solutions) or Ansible (mobile marketing). R/GA, a stand-alone digital agency, is an industry leader in the development of award-winning interactive campaigns for global clients. These specialty assets have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters, while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within IPG.  

Likewise, we continue to look for strategic investments that will position us to capitalize on emerging markets. In 2007, we made investments in India and Brazil, further strengthening our presence in these high-growth, developing markets. In 2008, we built on this strategy and completed an important transaction that increased our stake in the Middle East Communication Networks (MCN) to a majority position. Headquartered in Dubai, MCN is the regions premier marketing services management company, with 60 offices across 14 countries. Our partner in Russia is the acknowledged advertising leader in that country. In China, where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services, we continue to invest behind our companies.  

In the latter part of 2008, the economy and financial markets throughout the world deteriorated rapidly, and are expected to remain weak for much of 2009. These conditions present potentially significant challenges to the revenue growth of our company and others in the advertising and marketing sector during the upcoming year. The demand for our services, as well as the financial condition of some of our clients, has been adversely affected. While it is unclear how long these conditions will persist, we believe that our broad range of service offerings, our diversified client base, our geographic diversification, our strong talent, our liquidity position and our enhanced expense management capabilities provide a measure of protection in a harsh economic climate.  

Our Offering  

Interpublic is home to some of the worlds best known and most innovative communications specialists. We have three global brands that provide integrated, large-scale solutions for clients, McCann Worldgroup (McCann), Draftfcb, and Lowe Worldwide (Lowe), as well as our premier domestic integrated agencies and global media networks.  

       McCann offers best-in-class communications tools and resources to many of the worlds top companies and most famous brands. We believe McCann is exceptionally qualified to meet client demands in all regions of the world and in all marketing disciplines through its operating units: McCann Erickson Advertising, with operations in over 100 countries; MRM Worldwide for relationship marketing and digital expertise; Momentum Worldwide for experiential marketing and promotions; and McCann Healthcare Worldwide for healthcare communications.  

       Launched in 2006, Draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients seeking creative and accountable marketing programs. With more than 130 years of combined expertise, the company has its roots in both consumer advertising and behavioral, data-driven direct marketing. We believe the agency is the first global, behavior-based, creative and accountable marketing communications organization operating as a financially and structurally integrated business unit.

       Lowe is a premier creative agency that operates in the worlds largest advertising markets. Lowe is focused on delivering and sustaining high-value ideas for some of the worlds largest clients.

Our healthcare communications specialists reside within our three global brands, McCann, Draftfcb and Lowe.  

       We created a management entity called Mediabrands in 2008 to oversee our two global media networks, Initiative and Universal McCann, which provide specialized services in media planning and buying, market intelligence and return-on-marketing investment analysis for clients. Initiative and Universal McCann operate independently but often work closely with Draftfcb and McCann Erickson, respectively. Aligning the efforts of our major media and our integrated communications networks improves cross-media communications and our ability to deliver integrated marketing programs.

Sources of Revenue  

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising, marketing and communications programs in various media around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, we may enter into global, regional and local agreements.  

Revenues for the creation, planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up. Many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative and/or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement.  

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services.  

In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. Generally, we act as the clients agent rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges.  

Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients. Our revenue tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client activity.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. Fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at December 31. As is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies.

Clients  

Our holding company structure allows us to work with clients within the same business sector through our different agencies, as well as maintain a diversified client base by sector. In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26% of revenue in 2008 and 2007. However, our largest client accounted for approximately 5% and 6% of revenue for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008, our largest clients (in alphabetical order) were General Motors Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Unilever and Verizon. We represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets, as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines, in each case through more than one of our agency systems. Representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations. Any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency, and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time.  

Personnel  

As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately 45,000 persons, of whom approximately 19,000 were employed in the U.S. Because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success. There is keen competition for qualified employees.
