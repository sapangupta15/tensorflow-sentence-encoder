ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company entered into foreign currency option and forward currency exchange contracts during 2011 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011. Foreign currency option and forward contracts are described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 73 of our 2011 Annual Report. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
