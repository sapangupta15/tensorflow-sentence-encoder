 ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

Overview  

Wynn Resorts, Limited, a Nevada corporation, was formed in June 2002, is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Wynn, and is a leading developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We own and operate two destination casino resorts. In Las Vegas, Nevada, we own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, which includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau) we own and operate Wynn Macau which includes Encore at Wynn Macau. We present our results based on the following two segments: Las Vegas Operations and Macau Operations. For more information on the financial results for our segments, see Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 17 Segment Information.

Our Resorts  

Las Vegas Operations  

Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005. On December 22, 2008, we opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas resort as our Las Vegas Operations. We believe that this resort offers exceptional accommodations, amenities and service. For the sixth consecutive year, The Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas has received both the Forbes five-star and AAA five-diamond distinctions. The Spa at Wynn Las Vegas earned five-star recognition from Forbes for the fourth year in a row. The Spa at Wynn Las Vegas and the Spa at Encore are two of only four spas in Las Vegas to be recognized with the Forbes five-star award.  

Our Las Vegas Operations feature approximately 4,750 hotel rooms and suites, 220 table games, 2,430 slot machines and a poker room in approximately 186,000 square feet of casino gaming space, (including a sky casino and private gaming salons), casual and fine dining in 35 food and beverage outlets, two spas and salons, lounges, and approximately 97,000 square feet of retail space featuring boutiques from Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Hermes, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta, Vertu and others. Our Las Vegas Operations also offer three nightclubs, a beach club, a Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership, wedding chapels, an 18-hole golf course, approximately 283,000 square feet of meeting space, a specially designed theater presenting Le Rêve-The Dream, a water-based theatrical production, and an Encore Theater presenting Garth Brooks and other headliner entertainment acts. We believe that the unique experience of our Las Vegas Operations drives the significant visitation experienced since opening.  

Macau Operations  

Wynn Macau opened on September 6, 2006. On April 21, 2010, we opened Encore at Wynn Macau, an expansion of Wynn Macau. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau resort as

 our Macau Operations. We believe that this resort offers exceptional accommodations, amenities and service. For the fourth consecutive year, Wynn Macau and The Spa at Wynn Macau received the Forbes five-star distinction.  

Our Macau Operations feature approximately 1,008 hotel rooms and suites, 486 table games, 930 slot machines and a poker pit in approximately 265,000 square feet of casino gaming space, (including a sky casino and private gaming salons), casual and fine dining in eight restaurants, two spas and a salon, lounges, meeting facilities and approximately 54,200 square feet of retail space featuring boutiques from Bvlgari, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Tudor, Vacheron Constantin, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu, Zegna and others.

See Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations for information about our net revenues.  

Construction and Development Opportunities  

In January 2011, we completed a refurbishment and upgrade to the resort rooms at Wynn Las Vegas. A remodel of the suites was completed in early May 2011. These remodels were completed at a cost of $61 million.  

In the ordinary course of our business, in response to market developments and customer preferences, we have made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to our resort complexes.  

In 2011, we formally accepted the terms and conditions of a draft land concession contract from the Macau government for approximately 51 acres of land in the Cotai area of Macau. In December 2011, we paid the initial deposit of $62.5 million pursuant to this draft land concession contract. Following government approval, we anticipate constructing on this site a full-scale integrated resort containing a casino, approximately 2,000 hotel suites, convention, retail, entertainment and food and beverage offerings. We continue to finalize the project scope, timeline and budget.  

Our Strategy  

We believe that Steve Wynn is the preeminent designer, developer and operator of destination casino resorts and has developed brand name status. Mr. Wynns involvement with our casino resorts provides a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises. We integrate luxurious surroundings, distinctive entertainment and superior amenities, including convention facilities, entertainment, fine dining and premium retail offerings, to create resorts that appeal to a variety of customers.  

Our resorts are designed and built to provide a premium experience. Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau are positioned as full-service luxury resorts and casinos in the leisure, convention and tour and travel industries. We market these resorts directly to gaming customers using database marketing techniques, as well as traditional incentives, including reduced room rates and complimentary meals and suites. Our rewards system offers discounted and complimentary meals, lodging and entertainment for our guests. We also create general market awareness for our resorts through various media channels, including social media, television, radio, newspapers, magazines, the internet, direct mail and billboards.  

Mr. Wynn and his team bring significant experience in designing, developing and operating casino resorts. The senior executive team has an average of over 25 years of experience in the hotel and gaming industries. We also have an approximately 90-person design, development and construction subsidiary, the senior management of which has significant experience in all major construction disciplines.  

We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the United States, and worldwide.

Market and Competition  

Las Vegas  

Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. The casino/hotel industry in Las Vegas is highly competitive. Over the last several years, Las Vegas has been impacted by economic disruptions. In 2011, Las Vegas visitation and gaming statistics began to improve, but uncertainty remains regarding the future gaming, tourism and convention environment. Our Las Vegas Operations are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos in Las Vegas. Many competing properties draw a significant number of visitors and directly compete with our operations. Resorts located on or near the Las Vegas Strip compete with other Las Vegas Strip hotels and with other hotel casinos in Las Vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, themes and size, among other factors. We seek to differentiate our Las Vegas Operations from other major Las Vegas resorts by concentrating on our fundamental elements of design, atmosphere, personal service and luxury.  

Our Las Vegas Operations also compete, to some extent, with other hotel/casino facilities in Nevada and throughout the United States, casino resorts throughout Asia, and elsewhere in the world. In addition, the legalization of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers, such as the recently passed legislation in Massachusetts, could have a negative effect on our business. New or renovated casinos in Asia, including two new resorts in Singapore, resorts in the Philippines, and our resort in Macau, could draw gaming customers away from Las Vegas.  

Macau  

Macau, which was a Portuguese colony for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese political control in December 1999. Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and approximately one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane. We believe that Macau is located in one of the worlds largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau, the largest gaming market in the world, generated approximately $33.5 billion in gaming revenue in 2011, a 42% increase over the approximately $23.5 billion generated in 2010.  

Macaus gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. Tourist arrivals in 2011 were 28 million, compared to 25 million in 2010. The Macau market has also experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last few years. As of December 31, 2011, there were 22,356 hotel rooms and 5,302 table games in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms and 2,762 table games as of December 31, 2006.  

Gaming customers traveling to Macau have typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 89% of the tourists who visited Macau in 2011 came from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Macau completed construction of an international airport in 1995, which accommodates large commercial aircraft and provides direct air service to major cities in Asia, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta, Taipei, Manila, Singapore and Bangkok. Travel to Macau by citizens of mainland China requires a visa. Chinese government officials have, on occasion, exercised their authority to adjust the visa policy and may do so in the future.  

Prior to 2002, gaming in Macau was permitted as a government-sanctioned monopoly concession awarded to a single concessionaire. However, the government of Macau liberalized the gaming industry in 2002 by granting concessions to operate casinos to three concessionaires (including Wynn Macau), who in turn were permitted, subject to the approval of the government of Macau, to each grant one sub-concession to other gaming operators. There is no limit to the number of casinos each concessionaire is permitted to operate, but each facility is subject to government approval. Currently, there are 34 operating casinos in Macau.  

5  

Table of Contents 

In 2002, the other two concessions were granted to Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM) and Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited (Galaxy). SJM, which is controlled by the family of Stanley Ho, operates 20 of the 34 existing casinos, including the Hotel Lisboa and The Grand Lisboa. In addition, an affiliate of SJM owns one of three water ferry services and the helicopter shuttle service that links Macau to Hong Kong. SJM is a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed company.  

Galaxy owns the Waldo Hotel/Casino located on the Macau peninsula, Galaxy Star World hotel casino located immediately adjacent to Wynn Macau, the Grand Waldo Cotai and Galaxy Cotai. Galaxy is a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed company.  

Las Vegas Sands Corp., the owner and operator of The Venetian and The Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas and a former partner of Galaxy, entered into a sub-concession agreement with Galaxy in 2002 which allows it to independently develop and operate casinos in Macau. The Las Vegas Sands Corp. or its affiliate owns and operates the Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel, the largest casino resort in Macau and the Four Seasons Hotel Macau, located adjacent to the Venetian Macao. In addition, an affiliate of Las Vegas Sands Corp. is expected to open Sands Cotai Central, commencing in phases, in 2012, which will include additional hotel properties as well as gaming and retail space. In late 2009, Las Vegas Sands Corp. completed the initial public offering of Sands China, Ltd. on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  

A joint venture consisting of Melco, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed company, and Crown, Ltd., an Australian company, is currently operating the Altira and the City of Dreams, a large resort in Cotai. This joint venture operates its properties under a subconcession purchased from Wynn Macau in 2006. In December 2011, Melco Crown, a NASDAQ listed company, completed its dual listing and started trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  

In December 2007, a joint venture of MGM Resorts International and Pansy Ho Chiu-king opened the MGM Grand Macau, a resort on the Macau peninsula adjacent to Wynn Macau. The MGM Grand Macau is operated pursuant to a subconcession granted to the joint venture by SJM. In June 2011, MGM Resorts International and Pansy Ho Chiu-king completed the initial public offering of MGM China Holdings Limited on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  

Our casino concession agreement currently allows the government to grant additional concessions for the operation of casinos. If the government of Macau awards additional concessions or permits additional sub-concessionaires, Wynn Macau will face increased competition from casino operators in Macau. Resorts located on or near Macau compete with other hotels and with other hotel casinos in Macau on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment and size, among other factors.  

Wynn Macau faces competition from casinos located in other areas of Asia, including the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa resorts operating in Singapore, Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in the Philippines. Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia.  

Geographic Data  

Geographic data are reported in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional financial data about our geographic operations is provided in Item 7 Managements Discussion of Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Regulation and Licensing  

The gaming industry is highly regulated. Gaming registrations, licenses and approvals, once obtained, can be suspended or revoked for a variety of reasons. We cannot assure you that we will obtain all required registrations, licenses and approvals on a timely basis or at all, or that, once obtained, the registrations, findings  

6  

Table of Contents 

 of suitability, licenses and approvals will not be suspended, conditioned, limited or revoked. If we are ever prohibited from operating one of our gaming facilities, we would, to the extent permitted by law, seek to recover our investment by selling the property affected, but we cannot assure you that we could recover full value.  

Nevada  

Introduction. The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations made under the Act, as well as to various local ordinances. Our Las Vegas Operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which we refer to herein collectively as the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  

Policy Concerns of Gaming Laws. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy. Such public policy concerns include, among other things:  

       preventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;  

       establishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;  

       maintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding assets and revenue, providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;  

       preventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and  

       providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.  

Changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our Las Vegas gaming operations and our financial condition and results of operations.  

Owner and Operator Licensing Requirements. Our subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the owner and operator of our Las Vegas Operations, has been approved by the Nevada Gaming Authorities as a limited liability company licensee, referred to as a company licensee, which includes approval to conduct casino gaming operations, including a race book and sports pool and pari-mutuel wagering. These gaming licenses are not transferable.  

Company Registration Requirements. Wynn Resorts was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (Wynn Resorts Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, referred to as a registered company, for the purposes of the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Wynn Resorts Holdings was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company. In addition to being licensed, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as an issuer of First Mortgage Notes registered with the SEC, also qualified as a registered company. Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a co-issuer of the First Mortgage Notes, was not required to be registered or licensed, but may be required to be found suitable as a lender or financing source.  

Periodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and provide any other information that the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Commission.  

Individual Licensing Requirements. No person may become a more than 5% stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of the profits of, an intermediary company or company licensee without first obtaining  

7  

Table of Contents 

 licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with us to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. All applications required as of the date of this report have been filed. However, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason which they deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.  

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Commission may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.  

Redemption of Securities Owned By an Unsuitable Person. The Companys articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the Companys or any affiliates application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of Wynn Resorts capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by Wynn Resorts. The redemption price will be the amount, if any, required by the gaming authority or, if the gaming authority does not determine the price, the sum deemed by the board of directors to be the fair value of the securities to be redeemed. If Wynn Resorts determines the redemption price, the redemption price will be capped at the closing price of the shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed on the trading day before the redemption notice is given. If the shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, the redemption price will be capped at the closing sale price of the shares as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or if the closing price is not reported, the mean between the bid and ask prices, as quoted by any other generally recognized reporting system. Wynn Resorts right of redemption is not exclusive of any other rights that it may have or later acquire under any agreement, its bylaws or otherwise. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable Gaming Authority and, if not, as the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts elects, and as set forth in the Companys articles of incorporation.  

Consequences of Violating Gaming Laws. If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that we have violated the Nevada Gaming Control Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Gaming Control Act, or of the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Further, the Nevada Gaming Commission could appoint a supervisor to operate our Las Vegas Operations and, under specified circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisors appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.  

Requirements for Voting or Nonvoting Securities Holders. Regardless of the number of shares held, any beneficial owner of Wynn Resorts voting or nonvoting securities may be required to file an application, be investigated and have that persons suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the beneficial owner of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be  

8  

Table of Contents 

 found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.  

The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of the voting securities of a registered company to report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered companys voting securities to apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. However, an institutional investor, as defined in the Nevada Gaming Control Act, which beneficially owns more than 10% but not more than 11% of a registered companys voting securities as a result of a stock repurchase by the registered company may not be required to file such an application. Further, an institutional investor which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a registered companys voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but not more than 29% of a registered companys voting securities and maintain its waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by the registered company. An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Nevada Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered companys voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:  

       voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;  

       making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in management, policies or operations; and,  

       other activities that the Nevada Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.  

The articles of incorporation of Wynn Resorts include provisions intended to assist its implementation of the above restrictions.  

Wynn Resorts is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of Wynn Resorts voting securities. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.

Consequences of Being Found Unsuitable. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with the investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:  

       pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;  

       allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;  

       pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or,  

       fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such persons voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.  

Gaming Laws Relating to Debt Securities Ownership. The Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other security of the registered company if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the Nevada Gaming Commission decides that a person is unsuitable to own the security, then under the Nevada Gaming Control Act, the registered company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, it:  

       pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;  

       recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;  

       pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or,  

       makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.  

Approval of Public Offerings. We may not make a public offering without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On March 24, 2011, the Nevada Gaming Commission granted us and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of two years (the Shelf Approval). The Shelf Approval also applies to any affiliated company wholly owned by us which is a publicly traded corporation or would thereby become a publicly traded corporation pursuant to a public offering. The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by any of the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the offering memorandum or the investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.  

Approval of Changes in Control. A registered company must obtain the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission with respect to a change in control through merger; consolidation; stock or asset acquisitions; management or consulting agreements; or any act or conduct by a person by which the person obtains control of the registered company.  

10  

Table of Contents 

Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered company must satisfy the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and Nevada Gaming Commission with respect to a variety of stringent standards before assuming control of the registered company. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.  

Approval of Defensive Tactics. The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada corporate gaming licensees or affecting registered companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevadas gaming industry and to further Nevadas policy in order to:  

       assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies;  

       preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and,  

       promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.  

Approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before a registered company can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above its current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered companys board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.  

Fees and Taxes. License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon:  

       a percentage of the gross revenue received;  

       the number of gaming devices operated; or,  

       the number of table games operated.  

A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges and sales of food, beverages and merchandise where live entertainment is furnished.  

Foreign Gaming Investigations. Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered in Nevada, or is under common control with such persons (collectively, licensees), and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board of the licensees or registrants participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees and registrants are required to comply with the foreign gaming reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if it:  

       knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;  

       fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;  

       engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;  

11  

Table of Contents 

       engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or,  

       employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.  

Licenses for Conduct of Gaming and Sale of Alcoholic Beverages. The conduct of gaming activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas is subject to licensing, control and regulation by the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas, LLC licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license. Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact upon our operations.  

Macau  

General. As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau, S.A., an indirect subsidiary of the Company, is subject to the regulatory control of the Government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires or subconcessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Subconcessions may be awarded subject to the approval of the Macau government and each concessionaire has issued one subconcession. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Law and Administrative Regulations, forms the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.  

Under the Law and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaires equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key employees. Transfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.  

Each concessionaire is required to engage an executive director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 10% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the executive director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the management of a concessionaires casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.  

Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 4% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to games promoters. Such withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.  

A games promoter, also known as a junket representative, is a person who, for the purpose of promoting casino gaming activity, arranges customer transportation and accommodations, and provides credit in their sole discretion, food and beverage services and entertainment in exchange for commissions or other compensation from a concessionaire. Macau law provides that games promoters must be licensed by the Macau government in order to do business with and receive compensation from concessionaires. For a license to be obtained, direct and indirect owners of 5% or more of a games promoter (regardless of its corporate form or sole proprietor status), its

 directors and its key employees must be found suitable. Applicants are required to pay the cost of license investigations, and are required to maintain suitability standards during the period of licensure. The term of a games promoters license is one calendar year, and licenses can be renewed for additional periods upon the submission of renewal applications. Natural person junket representative licensees are subject to a suitability verification process every three years and business entity licensees are subject to the same requirement every six years. The DICJ implemented certain instructions in 2009, which have the force of law, relating to commissions paid to and by games promoters. Such instructions also impose certain financial reporting and audit requirements on games promoters.  

Under Macau law, licensed games promoters must identify outside contractors who assist them in their promotion activities. These contractors are subject to approval of the Macau government. Changes in the management structure of business entity games promoters licensees must be reported to the Macau government and any transfer or the encumbering of interests in such licensees is ineffective without prior government approval. To conduct gaming promotion activities licensees must be registered with one or more concessionaires and must have written contracts with such concessionaires, copies of which must be submitted to the Macau government.  

Macau law further provides that concessionaires are jointly responsible with their games promoters for the activities of such representatives and their directors and contractors in the concessionaires casinos, and for their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Concessionaires must submit annual lists of their games promoters, and must update such lists on a quarterly basis. The Macau government may designate a maximum number of games promoters and specify the number of games promoters a concessionaire is permitted to engage. Concessionaires are subject to periodic reporting requirements with respect to commissions paid to their games promoters representatives and are required to oversee their activities and report instances of unlawful activity.  

The government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. The government of Macau also may redeem a concession starting at an established date after the entering into effect of a concession. The government of Macau also may terminate a concession for cause, including, without limitation, failure of the concessionaire to fulfill its obligations under law or the concession contract.  

Concession Agreement. The concession agreement between Wynn Macau S.A. and the Macau government required Wynn Macau, S.A. to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau, including, at a minimum, one full-service casino resort by the end of December 2006, and to invest not less than a total of 4 billion patacas (approximately US$500 million) in Macau-related projects by June 2009. These obligations were satisfied upon the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006.  

Wynn Macau, S.A. was also obligated to obtain, and did obtain, a 700 million pataca (approximately US$87 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) that was effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this guarantee was reduced to 300 million patacas (approximately US$37 million) for the period from April 1, 2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is currently paid an annual fee by Wynn Macau, S.A. for the guarantee not to exceed 5.2 million patacas (approximately US$0.7 million).  

The government of Macau may redeem the concession beginning on June 24, 2017, and in such event Wynn Macau, S.A. will be entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied for the remaining years under the concession.

The government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession if Wynn Macau, S.A. fails to fulfill its fundamental obligations under the concession agreement. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:  

       conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;  

       abandons or suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;  

       defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;  

       does not comply with government inspections or supervision;  

       systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;  

       fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;  

       is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;  

       engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or,  

       repeatedly and seriously violates applicable gaming laws.  

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement for one of the reasons stated above, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino under Macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau will be transferred to the government without compensation. In addition, the government of Macau may, in the public interest, unilaterally terminate the concession at any time, in which case Wynn Macau, S.A. would be entitled to reasonable compensation.  

Seasonality  

We may experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month, however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.  

Employees  

As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of approximately 16,400 full-time equivalent employees (including approximately 9,000 in Las Vegas and approximately 7,400 in Macau).  

During 2006, we entered into a ten year collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary and Bartenders Union local that covers approximately 5,600 employees at our Las Vegas Operations. We also entered into a ten year collective bargaining agreement with the Transportation Workers Union in November 2010, which covers the table games dealers at our Las Vegas Operations. Certain other unions may seek to organize the workers of our Las Vegas Operations. Unionization, pressure to unionize or other forms of collective bargaining could increase our labor costs.  

The success of our operations in Macau will be affected by our success in retaining our employees. Wynn Macau competes with the large number of casino resort developments in Macau for limited qualified employees. We seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our Macau resorts, and policies announced publicly by the Macau government have affected our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. We are coordinating with the Macau labor and immigration authorities to ensure that our labor demand is satisfied, but cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our Macau operations or that we will be able to obtain required work permits for those employees.

Intellectual Property  

Among our most important marks are our trademarks and service marks that use the name WYNN. Wynn Resorts has registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) a variety of the WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include WYNN RESORTS, WYNN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, WYNN LAS VEGAS, ENCORE and WYNN MACAU. Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks.  

A common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname WYNN. As a general rule, a surname (or the portion of a mark primarily constituting a surname) is not eligible for registration unless the surname has acquired secondary meaning. To date, Wynn Resorts has been successful in demonstrating to the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name based upon factors including Mr. Wynns prominence as a resort developer.  

Federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.  

We have also filed applications with various foreign patent and trademark registries, including in Macau, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include many of the same marks filed with the United States PTO and include WYNN MACAU, WYNN LAS VEGAS and ENCORE. Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks.  

We recognize that our intellectual property assets, including the word and logo version of WYNN, are among our most valuable assets. As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our trademarks and other intellectual property rights in relevant jurisdictions. We have retained counsel and intend to take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world.  

On August 6, 2004, we entered into agreements with Mr. Wynn that confirm and clarify our rights to use the Wynn name and Mr. Wynns persona in connection with our casino resorts. Under a Surname Rights Agreement, Mr. Wynn has acknowledged our exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide right to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating, the Wynn name for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to our affiliates. Under a Rights of Publicity License, Mr. Wynn has granted us the exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to use his full name, persona and related rights of publicity for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the ability to sublicense the persona and publicity rights to our affiliates, until October 24, 2017.  

We have also registered various domain names including, but not limited to, www.wynnlasvegas.com, www.wynnmacau.com, www.wynnmacaulimited.com, www.encorelasvegas.com and www.wynnresorts.com, with various domain registrars around the world. Our domain registrations extend to various foreign countries such as .com.cn and .com.hk. We pursue domain related infringement on a case by case basis depending on the infringing domain in question.
