For the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated sales of $15.2 billion, operating income of $1,598 million and net cash from operating activities of $1,484 million. The table below presents a summary of our 2011 sales by major category of end customer. For a more detailed presentation of our sales by end customer, see Major Customers on page 14.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We have the following four reportable segments: (1) C3ISR, (2) Government Services, (3) Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M), and (4) Electronic Systems. Financial information for our segments, including sales by geographic area, is included in Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

On July 28, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to spin-off a new, independent government services company that will be publicly traded. The new public company will be named Engility Holdings, Inc. (Engility). See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview and Outlook  Spin-Off of Businesses that will comprise Engility on page 38 for additional information.  

Business Strategy  

Our business strategy is customer-focused and aims to increase shareholder value by expanding our strong positions in C3ISR, electronic systems and aircraft modernization and maintenance by leveraging our customer relationships and pursuing adjacent market opportunities. We intend to gain market share with disruptive,

Table of Contents 

 affordable solutions, collaboration across L-3 and demonstrated past performance that address customer imperatives. We will continue shifting our business portfolio to emphasize products, systems and proprietary services. The acquisition of the Kollmorgen Electro-Optical business completed on February 6, 2012, and our planned spin-off of the businesses that will comprise Engility are examples of this element of our strategy. Financially, our emphasis is on growing earnings per share and cash flow over time. Our strategy involves a flexible and balanced combination of organic growth, cost reductions, and select business acquisitions and divestitures, enabling us to grow the company and also return cash to our shareholders in a balanced and disciplined manner. Our strategy includes the elements discussed below.  

Maintain an Entrepreneurial, Accountable and Results-Driven Culture. A key part of L-3s strategy is our entrepreneurial, accountable, and results-driven culture that is focused on meeting our customers needs and on achieving L-3s strategic goals and growth objectives. L-3s culture is made up of diverse people providing creative solutions and ideas in an environment that fosters teamwork and collaboration across our business units. Operating with integrity and with a commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct is an important part of our strategy to build and maintain the trust of our customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and communities where we live and work.  

Grow Sales Organically and Selectively Acquire Businesses. We intend to use our existing prime contractor and supplier positions and internal investments to grow our sales organically. We expect to continue to benefit from our position as a supplier to multiple bidders on select prime contract bids. We plan to maintain our diversified and broad business mix with limited reliance on any single contract, follow-on or new business opportunity. We also expect to continue to supplement our organic sales growth by acquiring, on a select basis, businesses that add new products, technologies, programs and contracts, or provide access to select DoD or non-DoD customers and provide attractive returns on investment.  

Collaborate to Increase Growth Opportunities. We intend to deepen the collaboration among our diversified businesses to develop new business opportunities. The combination of our leading technologies and our ability to deliver the right solutions to our customers quickly and re-shape our portfolio underscores our reputation for performance and customer focus. We expect that our core strengths of agility, responsiveness and cost-effectiveness will allow us to continue to provide exceptional performance to our customers. We intend to continue our internal initiatives to consolidate and drive efficiency in our operations and develop our collaborative culture to continue our shift from a black box provider to a complete solutions provider.  

Continuously Improve our Cost Structure and Right-Size our Businesses. We intend to continue to aggressively improve and reduce our direct contract costs and overhead costs, including general and administrative costs. Our effective management of labor, material, subcontractor and other direct costs is an important element of cost control and favorable contract performance. We believe that proactively re-sizing our businesses to their anticipated sales, combined with continuous cost improvement will enable us to increase our cost competitiveness, and to selectively invest in new product development, bids and proposals and other business development activities to organically grow our sales.  

Align Research & Development with Customer Priorities. We intend to continue to align our products, services, internal investments in research and development and business development activities to proactively address customer priorities and requirements and invest in growth areas such as C3ISR, integrated sensor systems, cyber security and intelligence support. We also intend to grow our sales and gain market share through the introduction of innovative and disruptive solutions, new products and continued collaboration among our businesses to offer high quality and competitive solutions and services to our customers.  

Expand our Prime Contractor and Supplier Positions. We intend to expand our prime contractor roles in select business areas where we have domain expertise, including C3ISR and aircraft modernization and maintenance and expand our supplier positions in electronic systems by leveraging our customer relationships and pursuing adjacent market opportunities. We also intend to enter into teaming arrangements with other prime contractors and platform original equipment manufacturers to compete for select new business opportunities. As an independent supplier of a broad range of products, subsystems and systems in several key business areas, our growth will partially be driven by expanding our share of existing programs and participating in new programs.

Table of Contents 

 We also expect to identify opportunities to use our customer relationships and leverage the capabilities of our various businesses, including proprietary technologies, to expand the scope of our products and services to existing and new customers.  

Focus On Outstanding Program Performance. We believe that outstanding performance on our existing programs and contracts in terms of staying on-budget, on-schedule and in accordance with our contractual obligations is the foundation for successfully meeting our objectives of expanding L-3s prime contractor and supplier positions and growing sales organically. We believe that a prerequisite for growing and winning new business is to retain our existing business by successfully meeting the performance criteria included in our existing contracts. We will continue to focus on delivering superior contract performance to our customers in order to maintain our reputation as an agile and responsive contractor and to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.  

Attract and Retain Skilled Personnel. The success of our businesses is, to a large extent, dependent upon the knowledge and skills of our employees. We intend to continue to attract and retain employees who have management, contracting, engineering and technical skills and who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above.  

Business Acquisitions and Dispositions  

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we used cash of $20 million, $756 million and $90 million for business acquisitions, respectively. See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Business Acquisitions and Dispositions on page 40 for additional details about our business acquisitions, including their aggregate purchase prices, and our divestitures.

Our funded backlog does not include the full potential value of our contract awards, including those pertaining to multi-year, cost-plus type contracts, which are generally funded on an annual basis. Funded backlog also excludes the potential future orders and related sales from unexercised priced contract options that may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the potential future orders and related sales of purchase orders that we may receive in the future under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements during the term of such agreements.  

Major Customers  

The table below presents a summary of our 2011 sales by end customer and the percent contributed by each to our total 2011 sales. For additional information regarding domestic and foreign sales, see Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Direct sales to the end customer represent approximately 70% of our consolidated sales, and we are a subcontractor or supplier for the remaining 30%. Additionally, approximately 70% of our DoD sales for 2011 were direct to the customer, and approximately 30% were indirect through other prime system contractors and subcontractors of the DoD.

Table of Contents 

Our sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the U.S. Government. Various U.S. Government agencies and contracting entities exercise independent and individual purchasing decisions, subject to annual appropriations by the U.S. Congress. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our five largest contracts generated 11% of our consolidated sales. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our largest contract (revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command. Under this contract, which generated approximately 3% of our 2011 sales, we provide maintenance and logistical support services for rotary wing aircraft assigned to Fort Rucker and satellite units in Alabama. The current contract is expected to end on September 30, 2012. We submitted our proposal in November 2011 for the contract re-competition and anticipate the award will be made by August 2012. We cannot provide any assurance that we will win the re-competition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract.  

Research and Development  

We conduct research and development activities that consist of projects involving applied research, new product and systems development and select concept studies. We employ scientific, engineering and other personnel to improve our existing product-lines and systems and develop new products, technologies, and systems. As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 12,500 engineers, a substantial portion of whom hold advanced degrees, and who work on company-sponsored research and development efforts and customer funded research and development contracts.  

Company-sponsored (Independent) research and development costs for our businesses that are U.S. Government contractors are allocated to U.S. Government contracts and are charged to cost of sales when the related sales are recognized as revenue. Research and development costs for our commercial businesses are expensed as incurred and are also charged to cost of sales. The table below presents company-sponsored (Independent) research and development expenses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for our U.S. Government businesses and our commercial businesses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Customer-funded research and development costs pursuant to contracts (revenue arrangements) are not included in the table above because they are direct contract costs and are charged to cost of sales when the corresponding revenue is recognized. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding research and development.  

Competition  

Our businesses generally encounter significant competition. We believe that we are a major provider for many of the products and services we offer to our DoD, government and commercial customers.  

Our ability to compete for existing and new business depends on a variety of factors, including,  

       the effectiveness and innovation of our technologies, systems and research and development programs;  

       our ability to offer better program performance at an affordable and competitive cost;  

       historical technical, cost and schedule performance;  

       our ability to attain supplier positions on contracts;  

15  

Table of Contents 

       our ability to maintain an effective supplier and vendor base;  

       our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones, particularly those who have U.S. Government security clearances;  

       the capabilities of our facilities, equipment and personnel to undertake the business for which we compete; and  

       our ability to quickly and flexibly meet customer requirements and priorities.  

In some instances, we are the incumbent supplier or have been the sole provider on a contract for many years, and we refer to these positions as sole-source. On our sole-source contracts, there may be other suppliers who have the capability to compete for the contracts involved, but they can only enter the market if the customer chooses to reopen the particular contract to competition. Sole-source contracts are generally re-competed every three to five years and at times more frequently. For the year ended December 31, 2011, contracts where we held sole-source positions accounted for 57% of our total sales and contracts which we had competitively won accounted for 43% of our total sales.  

L-3 is a defense supplier with a broad and diverse portfolio of products and services. We are primarily a non-platform prime contractor and have diverse subcontractor positions. We supply our products and services to other prime system contractors. However, we also compete directly with other large prime system contractors for (1) certain products, subsystems and systems, where they have vertically integrated businesses and (2) niche areas where we are a prime contractor. We also compete with numerous other aerospace, defense and government technical services contractors, which generally provide similar products, subsystems, systems or services.  

In addition, our ability to compete for select contracts may require us to team with one or more of the other prime system contractors that bid and compete for major platform programs, and our ability to team with them is often dependent upon the outcome of a competition for subcontracts they award.  

Patents and Licenses  

Generally, we do not believe that our patents, trademarks and licenses are material to our operations. Furthermore, most of our U.S. Government contracts generally permit us to use patents owned by other U.S. Government contractors. Similar provisions in U.S. Government contracts awarded to other companies make it impossible for us to prevent the use of our patents in most DoD work performed by other companies for the U.S. Government.  

Raw Materials  

Generally, our businesses engage in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. L-3s business mix is approximately 50% services work, and for those businesses that sell hardware and product, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as a diverse base of third party suppliers and subcontractors. Although certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials, we have not experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes.  

Contracts  

A significant portion of our sales are derived from sole-source contracts as discussed above. We believe that our customers award sole-source contracts to the most capable supplier in terms of quality, responsiveness,  

16  

Table of Contents 

 design, engineering and program management competency and cost. However, as discussed above, we are increasingly competing against other prime system contractors for major subsystems and systems business.  

Generally, the sales price arrangements for our contracts are either fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material type. Generally, a fixed-price type contract offers higher profit margin potential than a cost-plus type or time-and-material type contract, which is commensurate with the greater levels of risk we assume on a fixed-price type contract.  

On a fixed-price type contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Accounting for the sales on a fixed-price type contract that is covered by contract accounting standards requires the preparation of estimates of (1) the total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work, and (3) the measurement of progress towards completion. Adjustments to original estimates for a contracts revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change.  

On a cost-plus type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contracts fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship which total allowable costs bear to target cost. The tables below present our sales from cost-plus type contracts with award fees and incentive fees and the percentage of available performance-based award fees we achieved for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.  

We believe we have a balanced mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts, a diversified business base and an attractive customer profile with limited reliance on any single contract.

The table below presents the percentage of our total sales generated from each contract-type for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Substantially all of our cost-plus type contracts and time-and-material type contracts are with U.S. Government customers. Substantially all of our sales to commercial customers are transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements and are included in our fixed-price type contract sales.  

Regulatory Environment  

Most of our revenue arrangements with agencies of the U.S. Government, including the DoD, are subject to unique procurement and administrative rules. These rules are based on both laws and regulations, including the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation, that: (1) impose various profit and cost controls, (2) regulate the allocations of costs, both direct and indirect, to contracts and (3) provide for the non-reimbursement of unallowable costs. Unallowable costs include, but are not limited to, lobbying expenses, interest expenses and certain costs related to business acquisitions, including, for example, the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses arising from fair value increases to the historical carrying values of acquired assets. Our contract administration and cost accounting policies and practices are also subject to oversight by government inspectors, technical specialists and auditors. See Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors beginning on page 20 for a discussion of certain additional business risks specific to our government contracts.  

Our U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. Investigations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including repayments, disallowance of certain costs, or fines and penalties. As is common in the U.S. defense industry, we are subject to business risks, including changes in the U.S. Governments procurement policies (such as greater emphasis on competitive procurement), governmental appropriations, national defense policies or regulations, service modernization plans, and availability of funds. A reduction in expenditures by the U.S. Government for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide, lower margins resulting from increasingly competitive procurement policies, a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us or the incurrence of substantial contract cost overruns could materially adversely affect our business.  

Certain of our sales are under foreign military sales (FMS) agreements directly between the U.S. Government and allied foreign governments. In such cases, because we serve only as the supplier, we do not have unilateral control over the terms of the agreements. Certain of our sales are direct commercial sales to allied foreign governments. These sales are subject to U.S. Government approval and licensing under the Arms Export Control Act. Legal restrictions on sales of sensitive U.S. technology also limit the extent to which we can sell our products to allied foreign governments or private parties.  

All of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.

Environmental Matters  

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements.  

We have also assessed the risk of environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification, either from the sellers of those acquired businesses or through pollution liability insurance. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and permits. We believe our current expenditures will allow us to continue to be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws, based upon available internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe there are no environmental loss contingencies that, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

Employees  

As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 61,000 full-time and part-time employees, 84% of whom were located in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 16% are covered by 180 separate collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The success of our business is, to a large extent, dependent upon the knowledge of our employees and on the management, contracting, engineering and technical skills of our employees. In addition, our ability to grow our businesses, obtain additional orders for our products and services and to satisfy contractual obligations under certain of our existing revenue arrangements is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.  

L-3 Holdings Obligations  

The only obligations of L-3 Holdings at December 31, 2011 were: (1) its 3% Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES) due 2035, which were issued by L-3 Holdings on July 29, 2005, (2) its guarantee of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of L-3 Communications and (3) its guarantee of other contractual obligations of L-3 Communications and its subsidiaries. L-3 Holdings obligations relating to the CODES have been jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L-3 Communications and certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. In order to generate the funds necessary to repurchase its common stock and pay dividends declared and principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness, if any, L-3 Holdings relies on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries.
