MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorps financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  

The Bancorps revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 54% and 46% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.  

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral.  

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, corporate banking revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, net securities gains and other noninterest income. Noninterest expense includes personnel costs, net occupancy expense, technology and communication costs, card and processing expense, equipment expense and other noninterest expense. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation known as the TCJA. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the top federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. U.S. GAAP requires the Bancorp to recognize the tax effects of changes in tax laws and rates on its deferred taxes in the period in which the law is enacted. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bancorp remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $220 million. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Bancorp recognized a $27 million decrease to interest income related to the tax treatment of leveraged leases and recognized $68 million of impairment on certain affordable housing investments in other noninterest expense. As a result of the TCJA, during the fourth quarter of 2017 the Bancorp decided to make a $15 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation recognized within other noninterest expense and also paid $15 million in one-time employee bonuses.  

Vantiv, Inc. and Vantiv Holding, LLC Transactions  

During the third quarter of 2017, the Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank entered into a transaction agreement with Vantiv, Inc. and Vantiv Holding, LLC under which Fifth Third Bank agreed to exercise its right to exchange 19.79 million of its Class B Units in Vantiv Holding, LLC for 19.79 million shares of Vantiv, Inc.s Class A Common Stock and Vantiv, Inc. agreed to repurchase the newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock upon issue directly from Fifth Third Bank at a price of $64.04 per share, the closing share price of the Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 4, 2017. As a result of these transactions, the Bancorp recognized a gain of approximately $1.0 billion during the third quarter of 2017.  

As of December 31, 2017, the Bancorp continued to hold approximately 15 million Class B Units of Vantiv Holding, LLC which may be exchanged for Class A Common Stock of Vantiv, Inc. (now Worldpay, Inc.), on a one-for-one basis or at Worldpay, Inc.s option for cash which represented approximately 8.6% ownership of Vantiv Holding, LLC as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Bancorp holds approximately 15 million Class B Common Shares of Worldpay, Inc., which give the Bancorp voting rights, but no economic interest in Worldpay, Inc. These securities are subject to certain terms and restrictions.  

On January 16, 2018, Vantiv, Inc. completed its previously announced acquisition of Worldpay Group plc. with the resulting combined company named Worldpay, Inc. As a result of this transaction, the Bancorp expects to recognize a gain of approximately $415 million in other noninterest income in the Bancorps first quarter of 2018 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the dilution in its ownership interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC from approximately 8.6% to approximately 4.9%. The Bancorps remaining interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment given the nature of Vantiv Holding, LLCs structure as a limited liability company and contractual arrangements between Vantiv Holding, LLC and the Bancorp. For more information on Worldpay, Inc., formerly Vantiv, Inc., and Vantiv Holding, LLC transactions, refer to Note 19 and Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NorthStar Strategy  

In the third quarter of 2016, the Bancorp launched the NorthStar Strategy, a three-year plan designed to help deliver strong, consistent returns through longer term economic cycles. Underpinning the strategy is the Bancorps goal of striving to be the One Bank people most value and trust.  

The Bancorp is focused on:  

   ●  

Building a differentiated brand and corporate reputation by improving the customer experience and increasing brand equity.  

   ●  

Growing profitable and long-term relationships with customers.  

   ●  

Leveraging analytics and technology to help drive further efficiency improvements, revenue growth and improved profitability.  

   ●  

Generating an annualized return on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) at the upper end of a range of 14% to 16%, a return on average assets at the mid to upper end of a range of 1.35% to 1.45% and an efficiency ratio below 60% by the end of 2019.  

   ●  

Achieving risk and operational excellence. 

The Bancorp has implemented several initiatives to assist in achieving these goals, including the following: our partnership with fintech companies, upgrades to our mortgage and teller systems, expansion of credit card and treasury management products, focused growth in asset-based lending and our commercial verticals and acceleration of our automation and robotics initiatives.  

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions  

During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorps common stock during the term of the repurchase agreements. For more information on the accelerated share repurchase program, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of the Bancorps accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into or settled during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, refer to Table 2. For further information on a subsequent event related to an accelerated share repurchase transaction, refer to Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

The settlement of the transaction is expected to occur on or before March 19, 2018.  

Senior Notes Offerings  

On June 15, 2017, the Bancorp issued and sold $700 million of senior notes to third-party investors. The senior notes bear a fixed-rate of interest of 2.60% per annum. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Bancorp. Payment of the full principal amounts of the notes is due upon maturity on June 15, 2022. These fixed-rate senior notes will be redeemable by the Bancorp, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.  

On October 30, 2017, the Bank issued and sold, under its bank notes program, $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior bank notes due on October 30, 2020. The bank notes consisted of $750 million of 2.20% senior fixed-rate notes and $300 million of senior floating-rate notes at three-month LIBOR plus 25 bps. The Bancorp entered into an interest rate swap to convert the fixed-rate notes to a floating-rate, which resulted in an effective interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 24 bps. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. For additional information on these senior notes offerings, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Automobile Loan Securitization  

In a securitization transaction that occurred in September of 2017, the Bancorp transferred an aggregate amount of $1.1 billion in consumer automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a VIE. This trust then subsequently issued approximately $1.0 billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately $261 million were retained by the Bancorp, resulting in approximately $747 million of outstanding notes included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. Third-party holders of this debt do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp. For additional information on this automobile loan securitization, refer to Note 11 and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Legislative and Regulatory Developments  

The FRB conducted a regularly scheduled examination covering 2014 through 2016 to determine the Banks compliance with the CRA. This CRA examination resulted in a change in rating from Needs to Improve to Outstanding. For further information, refer to the Regulation and Supervision subsection of Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Earnings Summary  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.1 billion, or $2.83 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net interest income was positively impacted by an increase in yields on average loans and leases, an increase in average taxable securities and a decrease in average long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017 and December 2017. These positive impacts were partially offset by a decrease in average loans and leases and increases in the rates paid on average other short-term borrowings, average long-term debt and average interest-bearing core deposits during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.03% and 2.88% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

Noninterest income increased $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in other noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. Other noninterest income increased $669 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares, an increase in private equity investment income and the impact of the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2016. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of certain transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 which included the impact of income from the TRA transactions associated with Vantiv, Inc., positive valuation adjustments and the gain on sale of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC and gains on the sales of certain retail branch operations. The year ended December 31, 2017 also included an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale 

 of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and a reduction in equity method income from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC. Corporate banking revenue decreased $79 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in lease remarketing fees, foreign exchange fees and letter of credit fees. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $61 million from the year ended December 31 2016 primarily due to a decrease in origination fees and gains on loan sales.  

Noninterest expense increased $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense and personnel costs. Other noninterest expense increased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in the impairment on affordable housing investments, professional service fees and marketing expense, partially offset by decreases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and loan and lease expense. Personnel costs increased $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by increases in base compensation, medical and FICA expenses and long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in severance costs related to the Bancorps voluntary early retirement program in 2016. The increase in personnel costs also included the impact of one-time employee bonuses that the Bancorp paid as a result of benefits received from the TCJA.  

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense, refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A.  

Credit Summary  

The provision for loan and lease losses was $261 million and $343 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.32% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.39% during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.53% compared to 0.80% at December 31, 2016. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.

Capital Summary  

The Bancorps capital ratios exceed the well-capitalized guidelines as defined by the PCA requirements of the U.S. banking agencies. As of December 31, 2017, as calculated under the Basel III standardized approach, the CET1 capital ratio was 10.61%, the Tier I 

 risk-based capital ratio was 11.74%, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.16% and the Tier I leverage ratio was 10.01%. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The following are non-GAAP measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures.  

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not 

 taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the 

 return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there 

 are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable 

 to the Bancorp during 2017 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorps financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. Effective January 1, 2017, the Bancorp elected to adopt the fair value method of measuring all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights as described below. Previously, the Bancorp had measured its servicing rights subsequent to initial recognition using the amortization method. There have been no other material changes to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2017.  

ALLL  

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorps ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. The Bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.  

The Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgement and is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.  

Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. 

 The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.  

Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which track the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.  

Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends.  

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.  

The Bancorps primary market areas for lending are the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorps customers. Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the Bancorps ALLL sensitivity analysis.  

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration.

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorps ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Income Taxes  

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the Bancorp operates are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. The Bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information. The Bancorp maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these items.  

Changes in the estimate of tax accruals occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and other guidance issued by tax authorities and the status of examinations conducted by tax authorities, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations. These changes may significantly impact the Bancorps tax accruals, deferred taxes and income tax expense and may significantly impact the operating results of the Bancorp.  

Deferred taxes are determined using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is calculated based on the difference between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. Significant management judgment is required to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Where management has determined that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance is maintained. For additional information on income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Valuation of Servicing Rights  

When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. The Bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. Effective January 1, 2017, the Bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. Upon this election, all servicing rights in these classes are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. Servicing rights are valued using internal OAS models. Significant management judgement is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS spread and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. In order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the 

 reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. Prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. Servicing rights were assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. For additional information on servicing rights, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Fair Value Measurements  

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.  

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The level of management judgement necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. Financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) require minimal judgement. The valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgement to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets, and, the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. Table 8 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using Level 3 inputs.

Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments.  

Goodwill  

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the methodology used by the Bancorp to assess goodwill for impairment.  

Impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorps common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorps reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the two-step impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp would be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.  

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorps stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and 

 actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.  

When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.  

During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Significant management judgement is necessary in the identification and valuation of unrecognized intangible assets and the valuation of the reporting units recorded assets and liabilities. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment process. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps goodwill.  

Legal Contingencies  

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps legal proceedings.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS  

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity.  

Tables 9 and 10 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the relative impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale and other securities included in other assets.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net interest income was positively impacted by an increase in yields on average loans and leases of 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net interest income also benefited from an increase in average taxable securities of $2.1 billion and a decrease in average long-term debt of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017 and December 2017. These positive impacts were partially offset by a decrease in average loans and leases and increases in the rates paid on average other short-term borrowings, average long-term debt and average interest-bearing core deposits for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Average loans and leases decreased $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The rates paid on average other short-term borrowings, average long-term debt and average interest-bearing core deposits increased 60 bps, 39 bps and 11 bps, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Net interest rate spread was 2.76% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2.66% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Yields on average interest-earning assets increased 23 bps, partially offset by a 13 bps increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.03% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2.88% for the 

 year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by the previously mentioned increase in the net interest rate spread, partially offset by a decrease in average free funding balances. The decrease in average free funding balances was driven by a decrease in average demand deposits of $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Interest income on an FTE basis from loans and leases (non-GAAP) increased $246 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by the previously mentioned increase in yields on average loans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in average loans and leases. Average loans and leases decreased primarily due to a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans and average automobile loans, partially offset by an increase in average residential mortgage loans. Interest income from credit cards included the impact of a $12 million benefit related to a revised estimate of refunds offered to certain bankcard customers in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a $16 million reduction in interest income for the expected refunds in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, the Bancorps interest income on commercial leases was reduced by $27 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the remeasurement related to the tax treatment of leveraged leases resulting from the impact of the TCJA. For more information on the Bancorps loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $51 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases in average taxable securities.  

Interest expense on core deposits increased $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 37 bps for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 26 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits was primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorps deposits.  

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in the rates paid on average other short-term borrowings and average long-term debt, partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorps borrowings. Average wholesale funding represented 24% and 26% of average interest-bearing liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For more information on the Bancorps interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.

Changes in interest not solely due to volume or yield/rate are allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amount of change in volume and yield/rate.  

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses  

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.  

The provision for loan and lease losses was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $343 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year 

 was primarily due to the decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets, which reflected improvement in the national economy and a decrease in outstanding loan balances. The ALLL declined $57 million from December 31, 2016 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.30%, compared to 1.36% at December 31, 2016.  

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the ALLL.

Noninterest Income  

Noninterest income increased $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table presents the components of noninterest income:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service charges on deposits  

Service charges on deposits decreased $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease of $4 million in commercial deposit fees.  

Wealth and asset management revenue  

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to an increase of $13 million in private client service fees driven by an increase in assets under management as a result of strong market performance and the impact of an acquisition in the second quarter of 2017. The Bancorps trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $362 billion and $315 billion in total assets under care as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and managed $37 billion and $31 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

Corporate banking revenue  

Corporate banking revenue decreased $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease from the prior year was primarily driven by a decrease in lease remarketing fees of $62 million which included $52

 million of impairment charges related to certain operating lease assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease also included $4 million in impairment charges on certain leveraged leases during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the impact of $16 million in gains on certain leveraged lease terminations during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, the decrease in corporate banking revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $15 million decrease in foreign exchange fees and a $6 million decrease in letter of credit fees.  

Card and processing revenue  

Card and processing revenue decreased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by higher reward costs.  

Mortgage banking net revenue  

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by a decrease in originations and lower margins due to the interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $10.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bancorp purchased $109 million of MSRs.  

Effective January 1, 2017, the Bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. Upon this election, all servicing rights are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes 

 in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the changes occur.  

Prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. Servicing rights were assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Net mortgage servicing revenue decreased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net valuation adjustments (including MSR amortization) of $20 million, partially offset by an increase in gross mortgage servicing fees of $7 million. Refer to Table 13 for the components of net valuation adjustments 

 on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mortgage rates decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to increase, leading to fair value adjustments on servicing rights. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $1 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS spread assumptions and decreased $121 million due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 which caused the modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, leading to a recovery of temporary impairment of $7 million on the servicing rights during the year. Prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate was distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights was reversed when the prevailing rates returned to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate.  

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp 

 maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio.  

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp may acquire various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net gains of $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, recorded in securities gains, net, non-qualifying hedges on MSRs in the Bancorps Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bancorp did not hold or sell any securities related to the non-qualifying hedging strategy during the year ended December 31, 2016.  

The Bancorps total residential mortgage loans serviced at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $76.1 billion and $69.3 billion, respectively, with $60.0 billion and $53.6 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Other noninterest income  

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other noninterest income increased $669 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares, an increase in private equity investment income and the impact of the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2016. These benefits were 

 partially offset by the impact of certain transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 which included the impact of income from the TRA transactions associated with Vantiv, Inc., positive valuation adjustments and the gain on sale of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC and gains on the sales of certain retail branch operations.

 The year ended December 31, 2017 also included an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and a reduction in equity method income from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC.  

The Bancorp recognized a $1.0 billion gain on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares during the year ended December 31, 2017. For additional information, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Private equity investment income increased $25 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by gains on the sales of certain private equity funds during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the impact of the recognition of $9 million of OTTI on certain private equity investments in the third quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment decreased $13 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by the impact of impairment charges of $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Income from the TRA associated with Vantiv, Inc. was $44 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $313 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by a $280 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from the existing Vantiv, Inc. TRA and the expected 

 obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options. This termination did not impact the TRA payments of $44 million and $33 million recognized in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

The Bancorp recognized positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv, Holding LLC of $64 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The stock warrant was not outstanding during 2017 as the Bancorp exercised the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC during the fourth quarter of 2016 and recognized a gain of $9 million.  

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp recognized $19 million of gains on the sales of its retail branch operations in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank and Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank of Pennsylvania.  

The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $80 million and $56 million related to the Visa total return swap during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase from the prior year was attributable to litigation developments during the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase in Visa, Inc.s share price. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and the related litigation matters, refer to Note 17, Note 18 and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Equity method earnings from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC decreased $19 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the Bancorps ownership percentage of Vantiv Holding, LLC from approximately 17.9% at December 31, 2016 to approximately 8.6% at December 31, 2017. 

Noninterest Expense  

Noninterest expense increased $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense, personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits) and technology and communications expense. The following table presents the components of noninterest expense:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Personnel costs increased $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by increases in base compensation, medical and FICA expenses and long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in severance costs related to the Bancorps voluntary early retirement program in 2016. The increase in personnel costs also included the impact of one-time employee bonuses of $15 million that the Bancorp paid as a result of benefits received from the TCJA. Full-

 time equivalent employees totaled 18,125 at December 31, 2017 compared to 17,844 at December 31, 2016.  

Technology and communications expense increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven primarily by increased investment in regulatory, compliance and growth initiatives.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other noninterest expense increased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in the impairment on affordable housing investments, professional service fees and marketing expense, partially offset by decreases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and loan and lease expense.  

Impairment on affordable housing investments increased $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by $68 million of impairment on certain affordable housing investments recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the change in the federal statutory corporate tax rate pursuant to the TCJA. Professional service fees increased $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to investments in the NorthStar strategy and other strategic initiatives. Marketing expense increased $10 million 

 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the new brand campaign. The provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments decreased $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in estimated loss rates related to unfunded commitments during 2016 and a decrease in the unfunded commitments outstanding during 2017. Losses and adjustments decreased $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the impact of favorable legal settlements during the year ended December 31, 2017 partially offset by increases in operational losses. Loan and lease expense decreased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to lower loan closing and appraisal costs driven by a decline in residential mortgage loan originations.

Applicable Income Taxes  

The U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the TCJA, on December 22, 2017. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the top federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. U.S. GAAP requires the Bancorp to recognize the tax effects of changes in tax laws and rates on its deferred taxes in the period in which the law is enacted. For the year ended December 31, 2017 the Bancorp is subject to a top federal statutory corporate tax rate of 35 percent. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Bancorp will be subject to a federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent. As such, the Bancorp expects its effective tax rate to significantly decrease from historical levels beginning in 2018.  

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits, partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 20.8% which was a decrease of 3.6% from 2016 primarily driven by a $220 million benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of the aforementioned reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate resulting from the TCJA, partially offset by the impact of an increase in income before taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included the impact of $178 million and $182 million, respectively, in tax credits and $34 million and $56 million of tax benefits from tax exempt income, respectively.  

For stock-based awards, U.S. GAAP requires that the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the Bancorps actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. The Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future. Based on its stock price at December 31, 2017, the Bancorp estimates that it may be necessary to recognize $12 million of additional income tax benefit over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards, primarily in the first half of 2018. However, the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the Bancorps stock price and the number of SARs exercised by employees. 

The Bancorps income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows:

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW  

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices or businesses change.  

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorps FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge rates and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP 

 curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing.  

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge rates and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. The credit rates for several deposit products were reset January 1, 2017 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. These rates were generally higher than those in place during 2016, thus net interest income for deposit-providing business segments was positively impacted during 2017. FTP charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. As overall market rates increased, the FTP charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2017.  

The Bancorps methodology for allocating provision for loan and lease losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for loan and lease losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

Comparison of the year ended 2017 with 2016  

Net income was $806 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income was driven by decreases in net interest income and noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense partially offset by a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $161 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by increases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases and increases in the rates paid of core deposits. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases of 37 bps from the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $38 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans partially offset by a reduction in the benefit from criticized assets. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 19 bps for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Noninterest income decreased $69 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by a decrease in corporate banking revenue partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income. Corporate banking revenue decreased $82 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by a decrease in lease remarketing fees of $62 million which included $52 million of impairment charges related to certain operating lease assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, corporate banking revenue included a $15 million decrease in foreign exchange fees 

 and a $6 million decrease in letter of credit fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Other noninterest income increased $18 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by an increase in private equity investment income primarily due to gains on the sale of certain private equity investments.  

Noninterest expense increased $70 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in other noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was driven by $68 million of impairment on certain affordable housing investments recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the change in the federal statutory corporate tax rate pursuant to the TCJA.  

Average commercial loans decreased $854 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by an increase in average commercial construction loans. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.7 billion from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of deliberate exits from certain loans that did not meet the Bancorps risk-adjusted profitability targets and softer loan demand. Average commercial construction loans increased $725 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in demand and draw levels on existing commitments.  

Average core deposits decreased $2.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in average savings and money market deposits and average demand deposits which decreased $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to lower average balances per account.

 These decreases were partially offset by an increase in average interest checking deposits of $498 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of new customers.  

Comparison of the year ended 2016 with 2015  

Net income was $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net income of $718 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $193 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in FTP credit rates on core deposits and an increase in average commercial loan and lease balances as well as an increase in their yields of 17 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. These increases in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by an increase in FTP charge rates on loans and leases.  

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $222 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in criticized commercial loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a $102 million charge-off during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 45 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Noninterest income increased $54 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in corporate banking revenue of $52 million driven by increases in lease 

 remarketing fees and syndication fees partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $57 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in other noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations, impairment on affordable housing investments and operating lease expense partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense.  

Average commercial loans increased $1.6 billion from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans.

Average commercial construction loans increased $926 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increased demand and draw levels continuing to outpace attrition. Average commercial leases increased $121 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $117 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.  

Average core deposits decreased $717 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits and average foreign deposits which decreased $487 million and $317 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net interest income increased $254 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases as well as an increase in interest income on taxable securities. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP credit rates on deposits allocated to the business segments, a decrease in interest income on loans and leases as well as an increase in interest expense on long-term debt.  

Provision for loan and leases losses decreased $60 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a reduction in the benefit for criticized assets allocated to the business segments coupled with an increase in the benefit from the reduction in the ALLL.  

Noninterest income increased $643 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by the recognition of a $1.0 billion gain on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares during the third quarter of 2017. The increase was partially offset by the impact of a $280 million gain recognized during the third quarter of 2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from the existing Vantiv, Inc. TRA and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options. This termination did not impact the TRA payments of $44 million and $33 million recognized in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2016 also included positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $64 million. The stock warrant was not outstanding during 2017 as the Bancorp exercised the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC during the fourth quarter of 2016 

 and recognized a gain of $9 million. The increase in noninterest income from December 31, 2016 was partially offset by negative valuation adjustments related to the Visa total return swap of $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $56 million for the prior year. Additionally, equity method earnings from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC decreased $19 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016.  

Noninterest expense decreased $6 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to increases in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments and decreases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments partially offset by increases in personnel costs and technical and communications expense.  

Comparison of the year ended 2016 with 2015  

Net interest income decreased $260 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in FTP credits on deposits allocated to business segments primarily due to an increase in FTP credit rates as well as an increase in interest expense on long-term debt. This decrease in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest income on taxable securities and an increase in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases. The provision for loan and leases losses was $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a benefit of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments.  

Noninterest income decreased $359 million from December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares and a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC, both of which were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant with Vantiv Holding, LLC. The decrease was also due to the negative valuation adjustment related to the Visa total return swap of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $37 million for the prior year. In addition, the positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the positive valuation adjustments of $236 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in noninterest income was partially offset by a $280 million gain recognized during the third quarter of 2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from existing Vantiv, Inc. TRAs and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options compared with a $49 million gain recognized by the Bancorp in 2015 for the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the Vantiv, Inc. TRA. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016 and a gain of $33 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a $31 million gain during the prior year. Additionally, equity method earnings from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $3 million from December 31, 2015.  

Noninterest expense was $90 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs and the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW  

The Bancorps 2017 fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $486 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $999 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017 and net income available to common shareholders of $372 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis was $963 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and decreased $14 million from the third quarter of 2017 and increased $54 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a $27 million reduction due to the remeasurement related to the tax treatment of leveraged leases resulting from the TCJA, partially offset by an increase in yields on interest-earnings assets. The increase in net interest income in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in short-term market rates and the impact of a $16 million reduction in interest income related to estimated refunds to be offered to certain bankcard customers during the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the aforementioned leveraged lease remeasurement.  

Fourth quarter 2017 noninterest income of $577 million decreased $984 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and decreased $43 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of decreases in corporate banking revenue, other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue.  

Service charges on deposits of $138 million were flat compared to the previous quarter and decreased $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by a decrease in commercial deposit fees.  

Corporate banking revenue of $77 million decreased $24 million compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by the impact of $25 million of impairment charges related to certain operating lease assets in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Mortgage banking net revenue was $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $63 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in mortgage banking net revenue compared to the third quarter of 2017 was driven by lower origination fees and gains on loan sales. The decrease from the prior year was driven by negative valuation adjustments (including MSR amortization). Fourth quarter 2017 originations were $1.9 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in the previous quarter and $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 originations resulted in gains of $32 million on mortgages sold, compared with gains of $40 million during the previous quarter and $30 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross mortgage servicing fees were $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, $56 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by net valuation adjustments, which include MSR amortization and MSR valuation adjustments, including adjustments due to changes to prepayment speeds, OAS spread assumptions and the passage of time and mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. Net negative valuation adjustments were $32 million and 

 $33 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2017, respectively, and $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Wealth and asset management revenue of $106 million increased $4 million from the previous quarter and increased $6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increases from the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 were primarily driven by an increase in private client service fees.  

Card and processing revenue of $80 million increased $1 million from both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected increased credit card spend volume, partially offset by higher rewards.  

Other noninterest income of $123 million decreased $953 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and decreased $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 included the impact of a $1.0 billion gain on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares recognized during the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by a gain of $44 million pursuant to Fifth Thirds TRA with Vantiv, Inc. recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Quarterly results also included valuation adjustments on the Visa total return swap which were charges of $11 million and $47 million in the fourth and third quarter of 2017, respectively, and a benefit of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter of 2016 also included a gain of $33 million pursuant to Fifth Thirds TRA with Vantiv, Inc. and a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC.  

The net gains on investment securities were $1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an immaterial amount in the third quarter of 2017 and net losses of $3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net losses on securities held as non-qualifying hedges for MSRs were $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net gains of $2 million during the third quarter of 2017 and zero during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Noninterest expense of $1.1 billion increased $98 million from the previous quarter and increased $113 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increases in noninterest expense compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 were primarily driven by increases in other noninterest expense and personnel costs. The increases in other noninterest expense from the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 were driven by increases of $62 million and $63 million, respectively, in impairment on affordable housing investments and a $15 million contribution made to the Fifth Third Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in noninterest expense from both the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016 also included an increase in personnel costs related to the impact of one-time employee bonuses of $15 million that the Bancorp paid as a result of benefits received from the TCJA.  

The ALLL as a percentage of portfolio loans and leases was 1.30% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 1.31% as of September 30, 2017 and 1.36% as of December 31, 2016. The provision for loan and lease losses was $67 million in both the fourth and third quarters of 2017 compared to $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net losses charged-off were $76 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or 33 bps of average portfolio loans and leases on an annualized basis, compared with net losses charged-off of $68 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Net tax deficiencies of $1 million, $5 million and $0 were reclassified from capital surplus to applicable income tax expense at March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, related to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 during the fourth quarter of 2016, with an effective date of January 1, 2016.  

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2016 WITH 2015  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $2.01 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends.  

The provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $343 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $396 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets, which reflected improvement in the national economy and stabilization of commodity prices, and a decrease in outstanding loan balances. Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.39% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 0.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average taxable securities of $3.1 billion and average loans and leases of $981 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps to 50 bps in 2015 and 25 bps to 75 bps in 2016. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increases in average long-term debt of $750 million coupled with a decrease in the net interest rate spread to 2.66% during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.69% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.88% for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Noninterest income decreased $307 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by an increase in corporate banking revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $291 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $64 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition to the valuation adjustments, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant 

 associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC compared with a gain of $9 million on the sale of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC during the same period in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in income from the TRAs associated with Vantiv, Inc. of $233 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year and a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment of $88 million during the year ended December, 31 2016 compared with the same period in the prior year. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $63 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by an increase in origination fees and gains on loan sales. Corporate banking revenue increased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by increases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $128 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in personnel costs, technology and communications expense and other noninterest expense partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and card and processing expense. Personnel costs increased $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in base compensation, variable compensation and higher retirement and severance costs related to the Bancorps voluntary early retirement program. Technology and communications expense increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance, and other growth initiatives. Other noninterest expense increased $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, impairment on affordable housing investments, the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and operating lease expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in travel expense, professional service fees and loan and lease expense. Card and processing expense decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts.

Loans and Leases  

The Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon primary purpose and consumer loans and leases based upon product or collateral. Table 24 summarizes end of period loans and leases, 

 including loans and leases held for sale and Table 25 summarizes average total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale. 

TABLE 24: COMPONENTS OF TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES (INCLUDING LOANS AND LEASES HELD FOR SALE) 

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, decreased $387 million from December 31, 2016. The decrease from December 31, 2016 was the result of a $271 million, or 1%, decrease in consumer loans and leases and a $116 million decrease in commercial loans and leases.  

Consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in automobile loans and home equity, partially offset by increases in other consumer loans and leases, residential mortgage loans and credit card. Automobile loans decreased $871 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2016 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns. Home equity decreased $681 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2016 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Other consumer loans and leases increased $879 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in point-of-sale loan originations. Residential mortgage loans increased $340 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the continued retention of certain agency conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2017. Credit card increased $62 million, or 3%, from 

 December 31, 2016 due to increases in customer accounts and the average balance per active customer as a result of a new product that launched in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Commercial loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by increases in commercial constructions loans and commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $566 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of deliberate exits from certain loans that did not meet the Bancorps risk-adjusted profitability targets and softer loan demand. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $294 million, or 4% from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns. Commercial construction loans increased $650 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in demand and draw levels on existing commitments. Commercial leases increased $94 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Average loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, decreased $1.6 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2016 as a result of an $841 million, or 1%, decrease in average commercial loans and leases and a $748 million, or 2%, decrease in average consumer loans and leases.  

Average commercial loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by an increase in average commercial construction loans. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.6 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of deliberate exits from certain loans that did not meet the Bancorps risk-adjusted profitability targets and softer loan demand. Average commercial construction loans increased $726 million, or 20%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in demand and draw levels on existing commitments.  

Investment Securities  

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing both collateral for pledging purposes and liquidity for satisfying regulatory requirements. Total investment securities were $32.7 billion and $31.6 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The available-for-sale investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 4.7 years at December 31, 2017 compared to 5.0 years at December 31, 2016.  

Securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. 

Average consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in average automobile loans, average home equity and average credit card, partially offset by increases in average residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans and leases. Average automobile loans decreased $1.3 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2016 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns. Average home equity decreased $690 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2016 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Average credit card decreased $64 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to elevated paydowns of mature accounts during the first half of 2017. Average residential mortgage loans increased $952 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2016 primarily driven by the continued retention of certain agency conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans. Average other consumer loans and leases increased $355 million, or 54%, primarily due to growth in point-of-sale loan originations.  

Securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At December 31, 2017, the Bancorps investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale securities. Securities classified as below investment grade were immaterial at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bancorps management has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios for OTTI. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bancorps methodology for both classifying investment securities and evaluating securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

Includes interest-only mortgage-backed securities recorded at fair value with fair value changes recorded in securities gains, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 (b)  

Equity securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at cost, FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock holdings and certain mutual fund holdings and equity security holdings.  

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities increased $620 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by decreases in U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities.  

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities were 25% and 24% of total interest-earning assets at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio was 6.5 years at December 31, 2017 compared to 6.7 years at December 31, 2016. In addition, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.18% and 3.19%, respectively.  

Trading securities increased $452 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in agency residential mortgage-backed securities purchased as part of the Bancorps non-qualifying 

 hedging strategy to economically hedge a portion of the risk associated with the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Information presented in Table 28 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale and other securities portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio were $176 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $159 million at December 31, 2016. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Core deposits decreased $683 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2016, driven by a decrease of $592 million in transaction deposits. Transaction deposits decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in money market deposits, savings deposits and demand deposits partially offset by an increase in interest checking deposits. Money market deposits decreased $652 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to lower balances per account for commercial customers partially offset by competitive pricing related to a promotional product offering during the second half of 2017 which drove customer acquisition for consumer 

 accounts. The money market promotional product offering also drove balance migration from savings deposits, which decreased $516 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2016. Demand deposits decreased $506 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to lower balances per account for commercial customers. Interest checking deposits increased $1.0 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of new commercial customers. 

The following table presents the components of average deposits for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $442 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase of $681 million in average transaction deposits partially offset by a decrease of $239 million in average other time deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits partially offset by decreases in average demand deposits and average savings deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of new commercial customers. Average money market deposits increased $708 million, or 4%, primarily due to competitive pricing related to a promotional product offering during the second half of 2017 which drove customer acquisition for consumer accounts. The money market promotional product offering also drove balance migration from savings deposits, which decreased $388 million, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2016. 

 The increase in average money market deposits was partially offset by lower average balances per account for commercial customers. Average demand deposits decreased $769 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to lower average balances per account for commercial customers. Average other time deposits decreased $239 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in average certificates less than $100,000 as a result of the low rate environment. The change in average core deposits from December 31, 2016 included the impact of the sale of $511 million of deposits as part of the branches sold in the St. Louis MSA and Pittsburgh MSA during the first half of 2016.  

Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $171 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2016 due primarily to the maturity and run-off of institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2016. 

Contractual Maturities  

The contractual maturities of certificates $100,000 and over as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in the following table:

Borrowings  

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Table 33 

 summarizes the end of period components of total borrowings. Average total borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 21% at December 31, 2017 compared to 22% at December 31, 2016. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total borrowings increased $1.0 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in long-term debt and other short-term borrowings. Long-term debt increased $516 million from December 31, 2016 primarily driven by the issuances of $1.5 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes, $300 million of unsecured senior floating-rate bank notes and asset-backed securities of $750 million related to an automobile loan securitization during the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by $787 million of pay downs on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations and the maturity of $650 million of unsecured senior bank notes and $500 million of unsecured subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2017. For additional information regarding 

 automobile securitizations and long-term debt, refer to Note 11 and Note 16, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other short-term borrowings increased $477 million, from December 31, 2016 driven by an increase of $625 million in FHLB short-term borrowings partially offset by a $115 million decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following table summarizes the components of average borrowings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total average borrowings decreased $1.2 billion, or 7%, compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in average long-term debt partially offset by an increase in average other short-term borrowings. Average long-term debt decreased $1.6 billion compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by the maturities of unsecured senior notes and subordinated debt, as discussed above, during the first half of 2017, and paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations. These were partially offset by the issuances of long-term debt, as discussed above, primarily during the second half of 2017. Average 

other short-term borrowings increased $313 million compared to December 31, 2016, driven primarily by the aforementioned increase in FHLB short-term borrowings partially offset by the decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW  

Risk management is critical for effectively serving customers financial needs while protecting the Bancorp and achieving strategic goals. It is also essential to reducing the volatility of earnings and safeguarding our brand and reputation. Further, risk management is integral to the Bancorps strategic and capital planning processes. It is essential that the Bancorps business strategies consistently align to its overall risk appetite and capital considerations. Maintaining risks within the Bancorps risk appetite requires that risks are understood by all employees across the enterprise, and appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place to limit risk to within the risk appetite. To achieve this, the Bancorp implements a framework for managing risk that encompasses business as usual activities and the utilization of a risk process for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.  

Fifth Third uses a structure consisting of three lines of defense in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities for effective risk management.  

The risk taking functions within the lines of business comprise the first line of defense. The first line of defense originates risk through normal business as usual activities; therefore, it is essential that they monitor, assess and manage the risks being taken, implement controls necessary to mitigate those risks and take responsibility for managing their business within the Bancorps risk appetite.  

Control functions, such as the Risk Management organization, are the second line of defense and are responsible for providing challenge, oversight and governance of activities performed by the first line.  

The Audit division is the third line of defense and provides an independent assessment of the Bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes. The Credit Risk Review division provides an independent assessment of credit risk, which includes evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs.  

Fifth Thirds core values and culture provide a foundation for supporting sound risk management practices by setting expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization.  

All employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with Fifth Thirds core values and Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. Fifth Thirds Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. Prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees across the first, second and third lines of defense and is a foundational element of Fifth Thirds culture.  

Below are the Bancorps core principles of risk management that are used to ensure the Bancorp is operating in a safe and sound manner:  

       

Understand the risks taken as a necessary part of business; however, the Bancorp ensures risks taken are in alignment with its strategy and risk appetite.  

       

Provide transparency and escalate risks and issues as necessary.  

       

Ensure Fifth Thirds products and services are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to its customers and to Fifth Third, and that potential opportunities remain aligned to the core customer base.  

       

Avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed and monitored.  

       

Act with integrity in all activities. 

       

Focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet customers needs.  

       

Maintain a strong financial position to ensure that the Bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions.  

       

Protect the Bancorps reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes.  

       

Conduct business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures.  

Fifth Thirds success is dependent on effective risk management and understanding and controlling the risks taken in order to deliver sustainable returns for employees and shareholders. The Bancorps goal is to ensure that aggregate risks do not exceed its risk capacity, and that risks taken are supportive of the Bancorps portfolio diversification and profitability objectives.  

Fifth Thirds Risk Management Framework, states its risk appetite and the linkage to strategic and capital planning, defines and sets the tolerance for each of the eight risk types, explains the process used to manage risk across the enterprise and sets forth its risk governance structure.  

       

The Board of Directors (the Board) and executive management define the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies, and forms the basis for enterprise risk management. The Bancorps risk appetite is set annually in alignment with the strategic, capital and financial plans, and is reviewed by the Board on an annual basis.  

       

The Risk Management Process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks and ensuring appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place, and risks and issues are appropriately escalated. Five components are utilized for effective risk management; identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.  

       

The Board and executive management have identified eight risk types for monitoring the overall risk of the Bancorp; Credit Risk, Market Risk, Liquidity Risk, Operational Risk, Regulatory Compliance Risk, Legal Risk, Reputation Risk and Strategic Risk, and have also qualitatively established a risk tolerance, which is defined as the maximum amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to take for each of the eight risk types. These risk types are assessed on an ongoing basis and reported to the board each quarter, or more frequently, if necessary. In addition, each business and operational function (first line of defense) is accountable for proactively identifying and managing risk using its risk management process. Risk tolerances and risk limits are also established, where appropriate, in order to ensure that businesses and operational functions across the enterprise are able to monitor and manage risks at a more granular level, while ensuring that aggregate risks across the enterprise do not exceed the overall risk appetite.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The ERMC, which reports to the RCC, comprises senior management from across the Bancorp and reviews and approves risk management frameworks and policies, oversees the management of all risk types to ensure that aggregated risks remain within the Bancorps risk 

 appetite, and fosters a risk culture to ensure appropriate escalation and transparency of risks. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  

The objective of the Bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the 

 authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and take any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorps credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios using the CCAR model and for certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, the stress testing is performed by Credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The risk grading system currently utilized for allowance for credit loss analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a through-the-cycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrowers creditworthiness. A through the cycle rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not 

 separated in the ten-category risk rating system. The Bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool. The Bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual risk rating system outputs to develop a U.S. GAAP compliant ALLL model and will evaluate the use of modified dual risk ratings for purposes of determining the Bancorps ALLL as part of the Bancorps adoption of ASU 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which will be effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2020. Scoring systems, various analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the Bancorps homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Overview  

Economic growth continues to improve as data has been broadly positive in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth is expected to continue in 2018 with the implementation of new corporate and consumer tax reduction programs. There have been steady gains in the job market and real GDP is expected to expand at a faster pace in 2018. Household spending continues to be the strongest driver of the U.S. economy. Inflation continues to run below the FRBs stated objective, however the rate of inflation is expected to increase in 2018. Improving global conditions are supporting U.S. manufacturing activity and housing prices continue to increase across the country. With regard to commercial real estate, the credit market has become somewhat more selective even though market data and vacancies remain positive. The Bancorp is monitoring potential increased risks in the Retail sector as a result of profitability declines among many large retailers and the year-end 2017 results are expected to show a continued shift to online purchasing.  

Commercial Portfolio  

The Bancorps credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting.  

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multi-national firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and 

 underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio.  

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), sensitivity and pro-forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves.  

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage loans individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

The following table provides detail on commercial loan and leases by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System), by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the Bancorps commercial loans and leases:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorps non-power producing energy and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolios have been identified by the Bancorp as loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the Bancorps commercial loan portfolio due to economic or market conditions within the Bancorps key lending areas.  

Due to the sensitivity of the non-power producing energy portfolio to downward movements in oil prices, the Bancorp saw 

 migration into criticized classifications during 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. However, in the second half of 2016 and 2017, the energy portfolio has stabilized and has shown improved performance. There has been a decrease in nonperforming assets in the past two quarters, primarily in the reserve-based lending category. Oil prices have stabilized, which has contributed to the improvement in the overall energy sector.

Consumer Portfolio  

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits, and risk committees.  

The Bancorps consumer portfolio is materially comprised of four categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and credit card. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these four categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTV ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. Among consumer portfolios, legacy underwritten residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress during the past credit crisis. As of December 31, 2017, consumer real estate loans, consisting of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, originated from 2005 through 2008 represent approximately 14% of the consumer real estate portfolio. These loans accounted for 46% of total consumer real estate secured losses for the year ended December 31, 2017. Current loss rates in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are below pre-crisis levels. In addition to the consumer real estate portfolio, credit risk management continues to closely monitor the automobile portfolio performance. The automobile market has exhibited industry-wide gradual loosening of credit standards such as lower FICOs, longer terms and higher LTVs. Fifth Third has adjusted credit standards focused on improving risk-adjusted returns while maintaining credit risk tolerance. Fifth Third actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which 

 mitigates credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations.  

Residential mortgage portfolio  

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTV ratios and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.  

The Bancorp does not originate mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio approximately $630 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 95% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 0.6%.  

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTV ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTV ratios and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.  

Portfolio residential mortgage loans from 2010 and later vintages represented 90% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and had a weighted-average LTV of 72% and a weighted-average origination FICO of 760.

Home equity portfolio  

The Bancorps home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorps newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 26% of the balances mature before 2025.  

The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is calculated on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable credit losses in the home equity portfolio. The modeled loss factor for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.  

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to 

 Table 48 and Table 49. Of the total $7.0 billion of outstanding home equity loans:  

   ●  

88% reside within the Bancorps Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as of December 31, 2017;  

   ●  

37% are in senior lien positions and 63% are in junior lien positions at December 31, 2017;  

   ●  

79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the year ended December 31, 2017; and  

   ●  

The portfolio had an average refreshed FICO score of 744 at December 31, 2017.  

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in credit limits when it believes that a customer has encountered financial difficulties and/or a decreased ability to repay their current obligations. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for more information.

Automobile portfolio  

The Bancorps automobile portfolio balances have declined since December 31, 2016 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the concentration of lower FICO (<690) origination 

 balances remained within the Bancorps targeted credit risk tolerance during the year ended December 31, 2017. All concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections.

The automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers. As of December 31, 2017, 45% of the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by new automobiles. It is a common industry practice to advance 

 on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

European Exposure  

The Bancorp has no direct sovereign exposure to any European government as of December 31, 2017. In providing services to customers, the Bancorp routinely enters into financial transactions with foreign domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign businesses as well as foreign financial institutions. These financial transactions are in the form of loans, loan commitments, letters of credit, derivatives, guarantees, bankers acceptances and securities. The Bancorps risk appetite for foreign country exposure is managed by 

 having established country exposure limits. The Bancorps total exposure to European domiciled or owned businesses and European financial institutions was $3.2 billion and funded exposure was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, the Bancorp was within its established country exposure limits for all European countries.  

The Bancorp continues to monitor the Brexit situation and its potential impact on the Bancorp. The Bancorps United Kingdom exposure is shown in the following table. 

The following table provides detail about the Bancorps exposure to all European domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of European businesses as well as European financial institutions as of December 31, 2017:

 (d)  

Other Europe includes European countries and territories not part of the Eurozone (primarily Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Isle of Man).  

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets  

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 56. For further information on the Bancorps policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Nonperforming assets were $495 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $751 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, $6 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $13 million at December 31, 2016.  

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.53% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 

 0.80% as of December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 33% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2017 compared to 25% as of December 31, 2016.  

Commercial portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $306 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $217 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease of $189 million in the energy related portfolio, of which $131 million was related to the reserve-based lending energy portfolio.  

Consumer portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $131 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $6 million from December 31, 2016. Refer to Table 57 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases.  

OREO and other repossessed property was $52 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $78 million at December 31, 2016. The Bancorp recognized $10 million and $17 million in losses on the sale or write-down of OREO properties during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately $36 million and $41 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings  

If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. These modifications are classified as TDRs.  

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Commercial loans modified as part 

 of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained.  

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $927 million and $958 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past due 30 days or more were 28%, 11% and 37%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs  

Net charge-offs were 32 bps and 39 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Table 60 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category.  

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases decreased to 22 bps during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 33 bps during the year ended December 31, 2016. Commercial loan net charge-offs decreased $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2017, was driven by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Included in net 

 charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $25 million and $30 million, respectively, of charge-offs related to certain healthcare loans and $5 million and $39 million, respectively, of charge-offs in the energy related portfolio including oil field services and coal mining loans.  

Consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans and leases were 49 bps for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 48 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consumer loan net charge-offs increased $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. Refer to Table 60 for a summary of net charge-offs by consumer loan category.

Allowance for Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall ALLL, including an unallocated component. These factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A for more information. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bancorp did not substantively change any material aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

The ALLL attributable to the portion of the residential mortgage and consumer loan and lease portfolio that has not been restructured is determined on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Loss factors for consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors. The prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. For real estate backed consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.  

The Bancorps determination of the ALLL for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. In the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for 

 commercial loans would increase by approximately $157 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, the Bancorps determination of the ALLL for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates would increase by 10%, the ALLL for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases would increase by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2017. As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.  

During the third quarter of 2017, the United States incurred two major hurricanes impacting the states of Texas and Florida. The Bancorp provided assistance to customers that were negatively impacted. The Bancorps ALLL included $10 million for the estimated impact of hurricane related losses at December 31, 2017.

Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the deconsolidation of a VIE.  

Certain inherent but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other qualitative adjustments. Due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-derived estimate of ALLL tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating credit environment, and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. Given these model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results. 

An unallocated component of the ALLL is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. The unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 0.13% and 0.12%, respectively. The unallocated allowance was 10% and 9% of the total allowance as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

As shown in Table 62, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.30% at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.36% at December 31, 2016. The ALLL was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  

Market risk is the day-to-day potential for the value of a financial instrument to increase or decrease due to movements in market factors. The Bancorps market risk includes risks resulting from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, primarily impacts the Bancorps NII and interest sensitive fee income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons:  

   ●  

Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;  

   ●  

Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or  

   ●  

The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.  

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorps earnings. Stability of the Bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorps balance sheet composition and 

 earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to reduce this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios. A series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are employed to ensure that this risk is managed within the Bancorps risk tolerance.  

Interest Rate Risk Management Oversight  

The Bancorps ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of market risk activities.  

Net Interest Income Sensitivity  

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorps assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected assumptions, as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

79 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Bancorps interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by measuring the anticipated change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped increases and a 75 bps parallel ramped decrease in interest rates. The analysis would typically include 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped decreases in interest rates; however, this analysis is currently omitted due to the current levels of certain interest rates.  

In this economic cycle, banks have experienced significant growth in deposit balances, particularly in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The Bancorp, like other banks, is exposed to deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment. In consideration of this risk, the Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $2.5 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances run-off over 24 months above what is included in senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $2.5 billion of growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 

 24 months above senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. The noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with market rate changes.  

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which Bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average rising rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 69% at December 31, 2017.  

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2017, the Bancorps NII would benefit in both year one and year two under the parallel rate ramp increases. The Bancorps NII would decline in both year one and year two under the parallel 75 bps ramped decrease in interest rates. The NII sensitivity profile is attributable to the combination of floating-rate assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, and certain intermediate-term fixed-rate liabilities. As the Federal Reserve has increased its target range for federal funds, the sensitivity to declining rates has increased, which is a reflection of the balance sheet mix described above. Reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits in this 

 scenario. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to changes in the composition of the investment portfolio, including premium and discount positions, and higher outstanding fixed-rate debt balances. These items were partially offset by lower demand deposit balances.  

Tables 64 and 65 provide the Bancorps estimated NII profile at December 31, 2017 with changes to certain deposit balances and deposit repricing sensitivity (betas) assumptions.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity  

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one and two year time horizons, EVE is a point in time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes 

 in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of transaction deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The EVE sensitivity to the +200 bps rising rate scenario is moderately negative at December 31, 2017, and slightly negative to a 100 bps decline in market rates. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from December 31, 2016 are primarily related to the effects of a flatter yield curve, higher base case loan and deposit values and lower fixed-rate loan balances.  

While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could 

 mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates.  

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impact on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.  

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk  

An integral component of the Bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. 

81 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities.  

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options.  

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible 

 inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. For further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk  

Although the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases expected cash flows, excluding interest receivable, as of December 31, 2017:

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk  

Effective January 1, 2017, the Bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. Upon this election, all servicing rights are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the changes occur. Prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. Servicing rights were assessed for 

 impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance.  

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $858 million at December 31, 2017 and the net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $744 million as of December 31, 2016. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.  

Mortgage rates decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to increase, leading to fair value adjustments on servicing rights. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $1 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS spread assumptions and decreased $121 million due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 which caused the modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, leading to a recovery of temporary impairment of $7 million on the servicing rights during the year. Previously, servicing rights were deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate was distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights was reversed when the prevailing rates returned to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate.  

The Bancorp recognized net gains of $4 million and $24 million, respectively, on its non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These amounts include net gains on securities related to the Bancorps non-qualifying hedging strategy which were $2 million and zero, respectively, during the years end December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on MSRs.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated loans. 

The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorps foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $939 million and $827 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by the Capital Markets Credit department and Capital Markets Risk department.  

Commodity Risk  

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by the Capital Markets Credit department and Capital Markets Risk department. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorps Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorps risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorps response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 

Liquidity Risk Management Oversight  

The Bancorps ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management.  

Sources of Funds  

The Bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings.  

Table 67 of the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. Of the $31.8 billion of securities in the Bancorps available-for-sale and other portfolio at December 31, 2017, $4.4 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $3.5 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorps securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorps ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets.

 A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. The Bancorp sold or securitized loans totaling $7.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to Note 11 and Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds. The Bancorps average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded 83% of its average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 82% for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Certificates $100,000 and over and deposits in the Bancorps foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.  

As of December 31, 2017, $8.2 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the then-current Bancorps Board of Directors authorizations and the Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. On June 15, 2017, the Bancorp issued and sold $700 million of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes.  

The Banks global bank note program has a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $16.7 billion was available for issuance as of December 31, 2017. On October 30, 2017, the Bank issued and sold $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior bank notes.  

At December 31, 2017, the Bancorp has approximately $40.8 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the FHLB and FRB.  

In a securitization transaction that occurred in September of 2017, the Bancorp transferred $1.1 billion in aggregate automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which subsequently issued approximately $1.0 billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately $261 million of the asset-backed notes were retained by the Bancorp, resulting in approximately $747 million of outstanding notes included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. The bankruptcy remote trust was deemed to be a VIE and the Bancorp, as the primary beneficiary, consolidated the VIE. The third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.  

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio  

The Bancorp is subject to the Modified LCR requirement, which stipulates that BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets that are not internationally active, such as the Bancorp, maintain HQLA equal to their calculated net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor of 0.7. The Bancorps Modified LCR was 129% at December 31, 2017.  

On June 1, 2016, the U.S. banking agencies published a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a modified NSFR for certain bank holding companies with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and with less than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposures, including the Bancorp. Generally consistent with the BCBS framework, under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of ASF over a one-year time horizon that equals or exceeds 

 the institutions amount of RSF, with the ASF representing the numerator and the RSF representing the denominator of the NSFR. Banking organizations subject to the modified NSFR would multiply the RSF amount by 70%, such that the RSF amount required for these institutions would be equivalent to 70% of the RSF amount that would be required pursuant to the full NSFR generally applicable to institutions with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures under the proposed rule. The comment period for this proposal ended on August 5, 2016. The Bancorp is currently awaiting the final rule from the U.S. banking agencies.  

Credit Ratings  

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorps or Banks credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorps or Banks financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.  

The Bancorps and Banks credit ratings are summarized in Table 69. The ratings reflect the ratings agencys view on the Bancorps and Banks capacity to meet financial commitments.*  

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems or due to external events that are neither market nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorps activities and can manifest itself in various ways including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, cyber-security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorps risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorps risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.  

To control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions, and to provide independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day to day operational risk (first line of defense).  

The Bancorps risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorps approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Vendor Risk 

 Management, cyber security risk management and review of operational losses. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorps goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorps performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred.  

The Bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cyber security risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. Fifth Third utilizes a wide array of techniques to secure its operations and proprietary information such as Board approved policies and programs, network monitoring and testing, access controls, and dedicated security personnel. Fifth Third has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework for the management and deployment of cyber security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. To ensure resiliency of key Bancorp functions, Fifth Third also employs redundancy protocols that include a robust business continuity function that works to mitigate any potential impacts to Fifth Third customers and its systems.  

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Operational Risk Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT  

Regulatory compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Thirds activities and functions. Fifth Third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorps integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Bancorps 

 risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorps risk appetite.  

The current regulatory environment, including heightened regulatory expectations and material changes in laws and regulations, increases compliance risk. To mitigate compliance risk, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program, and ensures that lines of business, regions and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. The lines of business and enterprise functions are responsible for managing the compliance risks associated with their areas.

 Additionally, the Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Compliance Risk Management program which implements key compliance processes including but not limited to, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, anti-money laundering, privacy and, in partnership with the Corporate Responsibility and Reputation team, oversees the Bancorps compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.  

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of 

 compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Fifth Third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments (in coordination with the Regulatory Change Management Committee), regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  

Management regularly reviews the Bancorps capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. 

 The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.  

Regulatory Capital Ratios  

The Basel III Final Rule was effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2015 and set minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defined the measure of well-capitalized. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On January 1, 2016, the Bancorp became subject to a capital conservation buffer which will be phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased-in, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital ratios, in order to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer was 0.625% in 2016 and is 1.25% in 2017. The 

 Bancorp exceeded these well-capitalized and capital conservation buffer ratios for all periods presented.  

The Bancorp made a one-time permanent election to not include AOCI in regulatory capital in the March 31, 2015 FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C filings. 

The following table summarizes the Bancorps capital ratios as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (b)  

Under the U.S. banking agencies Basel III Final Rule, assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures are calculated according to the standardized approach for risk-weighted assets. The resulting weighted values are added together resulting in the total risk-weighted assets. Under the banking agencies Final Rule published in November 2017 pertaining to certain regulatory items for banks subject to the standardized approach, the Bancorp is no longer subject to certain transition provisions and phase-outs beyond 2017.  

 (c)  

These capital amounts and ratios were calculated under the Supervisory Agencies general risk-based capital rules (Basel I) which were in effect prior to January 1, 2015.  

Stress Tests and CCAR  

In 2011 the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHCs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, 

 dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Further, each BHC must also report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The FRB launched the 2017 stress testing program and CCAR on February 3, 2017, with submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the FRB due on April 5, 2017, which the Bancorp submitted as required. As a CCAR institution, the Bancorp is required to disclose the results of its company-run stress test under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios and to provide information related to the types of risk included in its stress testing, a general description of the methodologies used, estimates of certain financial results and pro forma capital ratios, and an explanation of the most significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. On June 22, 2017 the Bancorp publicly disclosed the results of its company-run stress test as required by the DFA stress testing rules, which is available on Fifth Thirds website at www.53.com. With Fifth Thirds designation as a Large and Non-complex Bank, it is no longer subject to the qualitative aspects of the CCAR program.Refer to Note 3 and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the FRBs review of the capital plan, the FRBs non-objection to the Bancorps proposed capital actions and the Bancorps capital actions taken in 2017. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program  

The Bancorps common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.60 and $0.53 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Refer to Note 23 and Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchases. 

The following table summarizes shares authorized for repurchase as part of publicly announced plans or programs:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

In March 2016, the Bancorp announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to purchase 100 million shares of the Bancorps common stock through the open market or in any private transactions. The authorization does not include specific price targets or an expiration date. This share repurchase authorization replaces the Boards previous authorization pursuant to which approximately $14 million shares remained available for repurchase by the Bancorp.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial transactions that are considered off-balance sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorps Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorps off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and transactions with non-consolidated VIEs. A brief discussion of these transactions is as follows:  

Commitments  

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale, noncancelable operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, capital commitments for private equity investments, capital expenditures and capital lease obligations. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on commitments. 

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities  

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.  

Transactions with Non-consolidated VIEs  

The Bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on non-consolidated VIEs.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. The aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2017 are shown in Table 73. As of December 31, 2017, the Bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate 

 in future periods. Due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the following table. For further detail on the impact of income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorps management, including the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on the foregoing, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to management including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Bancorps management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Managements assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. The Bancorps independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Bancorps consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. This report appears on page 90 of the annual report.  

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS  

The Bancorps management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change during the year covered by this report.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Bancorp and our report dated February 28, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  

Basis for Opinion  

The Bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Bancorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
