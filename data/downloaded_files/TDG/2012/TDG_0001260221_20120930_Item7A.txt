ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At September 30, 2012, we had borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facility of $2.02 billion that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the CompanyÂ’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facility. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our New Senior Secured Credit Facility by approximately $20.2 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2012. The weighted average interest rate on the $2.02 billion of borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facility on September 30, 2012 was 4.0%.  

At September 30, 2012, three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were in place to swap variable rates on the New Senior Secured Credit Facility for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $353 million. Beginning December 31, 2012, these interest rate swap agreements will effectively convert the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the new senior secured credit facility to a fixed rate of 5.17% through June 30, 2015.  

The fair value of the $2.02 billion aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loan approximated $2.04 billion at September 30, 2012 based upon information provided to the Company from its agent under the credit facility. The fair value of the $1.60 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2018 is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of such notes approximated $1.70 billion at September 30, 2012 based upon quoted market rates.
