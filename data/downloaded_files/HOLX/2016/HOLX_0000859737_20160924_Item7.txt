Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report and our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this report.

OVERVIEW

We are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products with an emphasis on women's health. We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives.

We offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases and screen donated human blood and plasma. Our primary diagnostics products include our Aptima family of assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (Panther and Tigris), our ThinPrep system, the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test and our Procleix blood screening assays. The Aptima family of assays is used to detect the infectious microorganisms that cause the common sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, chlamydia and gonorrhea, certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis. The ThinPrep System is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. In blood screening, we develop and manufacture the Procleix family of assays, which are used to detect various infectious diseases. The Procleix blood screening assays also run on our Panther and Tigris systems. These blood screening products are marketed worldwide by our blood screening collaborator, Grifols S.A., or Grifols, under Grifols' trademarks.

Our Breast Health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, computer-aided detection, or CAD, for mammography and minimally invasive breast biopsy devices, breast biopsy site markers, and breast biopsy guidance systems. Our most advanced breast imaging platform, Dimensions, utilizes a technology called tomosynthesis to produce 3D images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast, which we refer to as the Genius 3D Mammography exam, as well as conventional 2D full field digital mammography images. Our clinical results for FDA approval demonstrated that conventional 2D digital mammography with the addition of 3D tomosynthesis is superior to 2D digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics.

Our GYN Surgical products include our NovaSure Endometrial Ablation System, or NovaSure, and our MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System, or MyoSure. The NovaSure system involves a trans-cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The MyoSure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus.

Our Skeletal Health segment offers Discovery and Horizon X-ray bone densitometers that assess the bone density of fracture sites; and mini C-arm imaging systems that assist in performing minimally invasive surgical procedures on a patient's extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, Hologic or our company refer to Hologic, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by items as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. All dollar amounts in tables are presented in millions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 26, 2015 

Product Revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We generated an increase in product revenues in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The growth was across our three primary business segments on both a domestic and worldwide basis, while Skeletal Health experienced a decline domestically and internationally. Product revenues increased 4.8% in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year, as reported growth was partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, most notably the Euro, Australian dollar and UK Pound.

Diagnostics product revenues increased 1.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases in Molecular Diagnostics of $28.6 million and Cytology & PeriNatal of $8.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $16.2 million in our Blood Screening business.

The increase in Molecular Diagnostics products, and in particular our Aptima family of assays, was primarily due to our increased installed base of Panther instruments, which is driving higher volumes of assay testing. These increases were partially offset by a slight decline in average selling prices, a reduction in Cervista HPV revenues as our larger customers transition to our Panther system, a reduction in Cystic Fibrosis revenues as we discontinued the product at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and a slight negative foreign currency exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. Overall, we experienced revenue growth both domestically and internationally in our Molecular Diagnostics business. The increase in our Cytology & PeriNatal products was primarily related to increases in instrument sales and Perinatal volumes partially offset by a decrease in our ThinPrep products, where ThinPrep volumes increased slightly domestically and increased more modestly internationally, but international sales were negatively impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, this business experienced an increase in domestic revenues but a decline in international revenues. Blood Screening revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a reduction in volumes related to the agreement between Grifols, our blood screening partner, and the Japanese Red Cross and lower instrument and ancillary volumes as well as the trend of lower blood donations in the U.S. The revenue decrease was partially offset by fluctuations in Grifols' domestic inventory levels, including increased fulfillment of the West Nile Virus assay. As a result, this business experienced an increase in domestic revenues but a decline in international revenues. 

Breast Health product revenues increased 5.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Our digital mammography systems and related products revenue increased $56.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher sales volume of our 3D Dimensions systems on a worldwide basis, principally driven by domestic sales. This resulted in our domestic 3D Dimension systems sales, which have higher average selling prices than international sales, increasing as a percentage of our total 3D Dimension system sales. In addition, we also had higher software sales primarily driven by our C-View product. These increases were partially offset by negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies and decreases in the sales volume of our 2D Selenia product. In addition, we had lower sales of our interventional breast solutions products of $4.7 million and had no sales from our MRI breast coils product line in fiscal 2016, which was fully disposed during fiscal 2015 and contributed $8.4 million in fiscal 2015. Overall, we experienced growth domestically in this business segment but had a decline internationally in our primary product lines.

GYN Surgical product revenues increased 17.2% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases in MyoSure system sales of $38.8 million and NovaSure system sales of $19.1 million compared to fiscal 2015 as volumes increased both domestically and internationally for each product. We believe the increase in domestic NovaSure volumes is partially attributable to a competitor's recent withdrawal from the market. The MyoSure system continued to gain strong market acceptance as unit sales increased globally. These increases were partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies.

39
Skeletal Health product revenues decreased 6.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to decreases in the sales volume of our older Discovery products, lower sales of our mini C-arm product and the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in our Horizon osteoporosis assessment product sales volume.

In fiscal 2016, 77.8% of product revenues were generated in the United States, 10.6% in Europe, 8.3% in Asia-Pacific, and 3.3% in other international markets. In fiscal 2015, 74.6% of product revenues were generated in the United States, 12.4% in Europe, 9.3% in Asia-Pacific, and 3.7% in other international markets. The increase in the percentage of U.S. revenues was primarily due to higher total product revenue in the U.S. in our Surgical, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostic product lines. The impact of the U.S. revenue increases, lower overall international revenues, and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, primarily against the Euro, Australian dollar and the UK Pound, resulted in a reduction in the European and Asia-Pacific revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Service and Other Revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. The majority of these revenues are generated within our Breast Health segment. Service and other revenues increased 4.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher service contract conversion and renewal rates and higher installation and training revenues related to increased sales of our 3D Dimensions systems. In addition, other revenue in our Diagnostics segment increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to $9 million of payments received under an agreement to license certain technology. 

Cost of Product Revenues. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Product gross margin increased to 55.9% in fiscal 2016 compared to 53.5% in fiscal 2015.

Cost of Product Revenues. Cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in the current fiscal year decreased in our Breast Health and GYN Surgical business segments and increased in Diagnostics and Skeletal Health compared to the prior fiscal year, resulting in the overall improvement in gross margins. 

Diagnostics’ product costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to unfavorable absorption variances, a mix shift in international sales to a higher percentage of lower margin molecular diagnostic products, inventory related charges for discontinuing the Cystic Fibrosis product, and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. These increases were partially offset by an increase in product revenue related to the increase in Aptima assay sales and related volumes resulting in favorable manufacturing variances, and lower production costs at our manufacturing facilities as we improve our operational efficiency and renegotiate pricing with certain of our vendors. In addition, we generated an increase in domestic sales, which have higher average selling prices, while international sales declined in the current year compared to fiscal 2015. 

Breast Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the favorable product mix shift to our higher margin 3D Dimensions system. Our 3D Dimensions systems have higher average sales prices than our 2D systems. In addition, we had higher software sales primarily due to our C-View product, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, and we experienced favorable manufacturing variances. Further, we generated an increase in domestic sales, which have higher average selling prices, while international sales declined in fiscal 

40
2016 compared to fiscal 2015 resulting in an improved gross margin. We also had lower sales of our interventional breast solutions disposables and no sales from our MRI breast coils product line, which was fully disposed during fiscal 2015. Both of these product lines have lower gross margins than our digital mammography systems. 

GYN Surgical’s product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in sales volumes for both our MyoSure and NovaSure products resulting in favorable manufacturing variances, partially offset by product mix shift to our lower margin MyoSure products. In addition, the prior fiscal year included a $4.0 million charge to write-off certain inventory that would not be utilized. 

Skeletal Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an overall decrease in revenues, partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances as we built additional inventory in anticipation of outsourcing the manufacturing of a majority of the division's products to a third party.

Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8.5 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. The decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets from the Cytyc Corporation acquisition, which are being amortized based on the pattern of economic use, and the full amortization of assets acquired in our Suros acquisition. These decreases were partially offset due to the acceleration of amortization of the Cystic Fibrosis developed technology asset of $6.2 million in fiscal 2016 as a result of discontinuing this product.

Cost of Service and Other Revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Service and other revenues gross margin was 51.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to 50.0% in fiscal 2015. Within our Breast Health segment, the increase in gross margin is related to higher service contract conversion and renewal rates and higher installation and training revenues related to our increased sales of 3D Dimensions systems. In addition, we had an increase in other revenue in our Diagnostics segment primarily due to $9 million of royalty payments from licensing certain technology, which had no corresponding service costs.

Operating Expenses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 8.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher compensation, primarily in our Breast Health segment from additional headcount. There was also an increase in new product development spend in Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health for prototype materials and consulting. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.

41
Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 14.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher compensation from an increase in headcount in Diagnostics, GYN Surgical and Breast Health, increased commissions as a result of higher sales, an increase in spending on a number of marketing initiatives primarily in our Breast Health and Diagnostics businesses, higher medical education spend in GYN Surgical and higher travel, trade show and meeting expenses. 

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 2.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a $6.0 million charge for settling a legal fee dispute in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and to a lesser extent, due to higher salary and compensation from increased headcount, increased consulting and legal expenses for a number of corporate initiatives including organizational structure changes and finance operational improvements, an increase in information systems infrastructure and project costs, and an increase in stock-based compensation from implementing a retirement plan provision in our equity compensation plan in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the medical device excise tax of $16.9 million as a result of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 ("PATH"), which went into effect December 15, 2015, and provides for a two-year moratorium on the 2.3% excise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices in the United States on or after January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, and lower tax fees. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, and business licenses from our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization expense decreased 18.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets from the Gen-Probe Incorporated acquisition and the Cytyc acquisition, which are being amortized based on the pattern of economic use.

Restructuring and Divestiture Charges.  In fiscal 2014, we implemented cost containment measures that primarily resulted in headcount reductions and also started the process of reorganizing our senior management team and international structure, which led to additional headcount actions in fiscal 2015. In addition, in fiscal 2015, we decided to shut down our Bedford, Massachusetts facility and transfer production of our Skeletal Health products to a third-party contract manufacturer and other activities to our Marlborough, Massachusetts and Danbury, Connecticut facilities. We also implemented additional organizational changes to our international operations throughout fiscal 2016 which resulted in additional charges. Pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the related severance and benefit charges are recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or up-front for contractual benefits, and other charges are being recognized as incurred. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recorded aggregate charges of $10.5 million and $28.5 million, respectively, from these actions, primarily for severance and benefits and to a lesser extent facility closure costs. Included in the fiscal 2015 charges was a $9.6 million charge to write-off the cumulative translation adjustment related to the divestiture of our MRI breast coils product line. This subsidiary was deemed to be substantially liquidated in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as operations fully ceased. For additional information, please refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.

In connection with shutting down the Bedford location, we expect to record lease obligation charges ranging from approximately $8.0 million to $12.0 million in fiscal 2017 as we meet the cease-use date requirements for a portion of the facility. In order to estimate the lease obligation charges, we have made certain assumptions including the time period it will take to obtain a subtenant and certain sub-lease rates. These estimates may vary from the sub-lease agreements ultimately executed, if at all, resulting in an adjustment to the charges.

Interest Expense.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our Convertible Notes, 2022 Senior Notes, Senior Notes, and amounts borrowed under our Credit Agreement, Prior Credit Agreement and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower outstanding balances as a result of scheduled principal payments, a term loan prepayment and extinguishments in fiscal 2015 and, to a lesser extent, Convertible Note repurchases in fiscal 2016 of $274.2 million principal amount, and lower interest rates in fiscal 2016 as a result of debt refinancings in fiscal 2015.

42
Debt Extinguishment Loss.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On various dates during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, we entered into privately negotiated repurchase transactions and extinguished $137.6 million and $136.6 million principal amount of our 2010 Notes and 2012 Notes, respectively, for an aggregate payment of $392.8 million, which includes a premium conversion resulting from our stock price on the date of the transactions being in excess of the conversion prices. In connection with these transactions, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $4.6 million and $0.7 million on the 2010 Notes and 2012 Notes, respectively, related to the difference between the fair value of their respective liability components and carrying values at the repurchase dates plus a pro-rata amount of deferred issuance costs. The remaining cash payments were allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recorded within additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders' equity.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds of the 2022 Senior Notes, plus available cash to discharge the outstanding 6.25% Senior Notes due 2020 at an aggregate redemption price of $1.03 billion, reflecting a redemption premium payment of $31.25 million. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $22.3 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the redemption premium and debt issuance costs for extinguished lenders.

Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, on various dates, we entered into privately negotiated transactions and repurchased $300 million principal amount of our 2010 Notes for a total payment of $543.7 million, which included the conversion premium resulting from our stock price on the date of transaction being in excess of the conversion price. In connection with these transactions, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $15.5 million related to the difference between the fair value of the liability component of the 2010 Notes and their respective carrying value at the redemption date. The remaining cash payments were allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recorded within additional paid-in-capital within stockholders' equity.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into a new Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The initial net proceeds under the new Credit Agreement were used to refinance our obligations under our Prior Credit Agreement with Goldman Sachs Bank USA. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $18.2 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs under the existing facility.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we voluntarily pre-paid $300.0 million of our Term Loan B facility under the Prior Credit Agreement. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $6.7 million to write-off the pro-rata amount of unamortized debt discount and deferred issuance costs related to this voluntary pre-payment.

Other Income (expense), net.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

** Percentage not meaningful

In fiscal 2016, this account was primarily comprised of a $25.1 million realized gain on the sale of a marketable security, and a gain of $3.3 million on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan. These gains were partially offset by an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $1.1 million on a marketable security and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.0 million. 

In fiscal 2015, this account was primarily comprised of an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $7.8 million on a marketable security, net foreign currency exchange losses of $2.9 million, and $1.0 million of losses on cash surrender value of life insurance contracts and mutual funds related to our deferred compensation plan.

43
Provision for Income Taxes.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 20.3% compared to 25.8% in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, the domestic production activities deduction benefit, and a change in the valuation allowance related to the sale of a marketable security with a higher tax than book basis. For fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the domestic production activities deduction benefit.

Segment Results of Operations

We report our business as four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income. Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

Diagnostics.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased gross profit and lower operating expenses. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased Aptima and Cytology & Perinatal product sales, partially offset by lower blood screening revenues, as discussed above, and an increase in other revenue primarily due to $9.0 million in payments received in fiscal 2016 under an agreement to license certain technology for which there were no corresponding costs. In addition, we had favorable manufacturing variances and lower production costs at our manufacturing facilities as we improve our operational effectiveness and renegotiate pricing with certain of our vendors. Partially offsetting these improvements were unfavorable absorption variances, a mix shift in international sales to lower margin molecular diagnostic products, inventory related charges for discontinuing the Cystic Fibrosis product, the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies, and the acceleration of amortization of the Cystic Fibrosis developed technology asset of $6.2 million. Overall, the gross margin improved slightly to 49.5% in fiscal 2016 from 49.3% in fiscal 2015.

Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower amortization expense of $16.9 million, lower medical device excise taxes of $7.5 million, and lower restructuring charges. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses related to increased compensation for additional headcount and commissions, increased marketing initiatives and trade shows and an increase in legal fees related to the settlement of a fee dispute for $6.0 million.

44
Breast Health.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the $34.6 million increase in product revenues discussed above and a $14.7 million increase in service revenues.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in 3D Dimensions sales, on both a unit basis and as a percentage of total digital mammography systems, compared to our 2D systems, and an increase in software related sales, each of which have higher gross margins. We also generated an increase in domestic sales, which have higher average selling prices, while international sales declined in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 resulting in an improved gross margin. In addition, this business experienced favorable manufacturing variances. These increases were partially offset by the negative foreign currency impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, overall gross margin increased to 59.9% in fiscal 2016 compared to 56.4% in fiscal 2015.

Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in compensation and commissions from increased headcount and improved operating results, higher marketing expenditures for a number of marketing programs, and increased trade show and meeting expenses, higher clinical trial and prototype materials expenses, and increased information systems infrastructure costs. These expense increases were partially offset by lower medical device excise taxes of $5.8 million, lower intangible asset amortization expense of $2.5 million, and lower restructuring expenses in which the prior year included a $9.6 million charge to write-off the cumulative translation adjustment related to the divestiture of our MRI breast coils product line.

GYN Surgical.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

GYN Surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in revenues and gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin increased to 62.0% in fiscal 2016 from 57.3% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased sales volumes for both our MyoSure and NovaSure products resulting in favorable manufacturing variances, partially offset by product mix shift to our lower margin MyoSure products. In addition, intangible asset amortization expense was lower in the current year. Gross margin was also higher in the current year as the prior year included a $4.0 million charge to write-off inventory that would not be utilized. 

Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in compensation from additional headcount, higher commissions due to increased sales, increased spend on marketing initiatives, trade shows and medical education, increased research and development expenses and higher legal expenses. 

45
Skeletal Health.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Skeletal Health revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues of $4.0 million discussed above. 

Operating income decreased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher operating expenses for compensation and additional investment in research and development projects, while gross profit increased slightly as a result of higher sales of our higher margin Horizon product and favorable manufacturing variances as we built up inventory in advance of transitioning production of these products to a third-party manufacturer. 

46
Fiscal Year Ended September 26, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 27, 2014 

Product Revenues. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We generated an increase in product revenues in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The growth was across all four of our business segments on both a domestic and worldwide basis. Product revenues increased 8.4% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, as reported growth was partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, most notably the Euro, UK Pound and Renminbi.

Diagnostics product revenues increased 4.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in Molecular Diagnostics of $32.3 million and Blood Screening of $27.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $12.1 million in our Cytology & PeriNatal business.

 The increase in Molecular Diagnostics products, and in particular our Aptima family of assays was primarily due to increased volumes due to our increased installed base of Panther instruments, and increased sales volumes of our HPV screening assay, which was FDA approved for use on our Panther system in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in Cervista HPV revenues as customers transitioned to our Panther system and Aptima HPV assay and lower instrumentation sales due to the significant purchases made by Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we experienced slightly lower average selling prices. Our Blood Screening revenues increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to volume increases related to the agreement between Grifols, our blood screening partner, and the Japanese Red Cross, and restocking of certain assays for Grifols to normalize its inventory levels. The decrease in our Cytology & PeriNatal revenues in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily related to the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies, lower instrument sales and slightly lower average selling prices in China. ThinPrep Pap Test volumes domestically increased slightly in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and increased more modestly internationally. In the U.S., we believe the negative impact on ThinPrep Pap test volumes resulting from interval expansion for cervical cancer screening was largely negated by our increased market share gains. 

Breast Health product revenues increased 16.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our digital mammography systems and related products revenue increased $116.1 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in 3D Dimensions units sold on a worldwide basis, which was principally driven by domestic sales. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices and a product mix shift within the 3D offerings to systems with less features. In addition, we also had higher sales of 3D upgrades and related products primarily driven by our C-View product. As expected, we continued to experience a decline in the number of 2D systems sold as customers transition to the 3D Dimensions systems, which occurred primarily in the United States. The increase in revenue was also partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies, lower MRI breast coils product line revenue of $6.9 million as a result of the divestiture of this product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, and a decline of $10.2 million related to our Hitec-Imaging business primarily as a result of the completed shutdown of its organic photoconductor production line in fiscal 2014. 

GYN Surgical product revenues increased 9.1% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in MyoSure system sales of $29.1 million partially offset by lower NovaSure device sales of $1.3 million. The MyoSure system continued to gain strong market acceptance as unit sales increased globally, partially offset by product mix and slightly lower average sales prices. NovaSure revenues were slightly lower in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies and slightly lower domestic volume, partially offset by higher international volume.

Skeletal Health product revenues increased 4.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to volume increases in our Horizon osteoporosis assessment product sales on worldwide basis, which were partially offset by lower

volumes of our older Discovery products, the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies, and lower average selling prices. 

In fiscal 2015, 74.6% of product sales were generated in the United States, 12.4% in Europe, 9.3% in Asia-Pacific, and 3.7% in other international markets. In fiscal 2014, 73.6% of product sales were generated in the United States, 13.8% in Europe, 8.6% in Asia-Pacific, and 4.0% in other international markets. The increase in the percentage of U.S. revenues was primarily due to increased sales of our 3D Dimensions system and related products and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Euro and UK Pound, which resulted in lower European revenues.

Service and Other Revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Service and other revenues decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as fiscal 2014 service and other revenues included $20.1 million of non-recurring revenue within our Diagnostics segment related to executing a license amendment with Roka Bioscience, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding this impact, service and other revenues increased by $18.9 million or 4.5% in fiscal 2015 due to a favorable shift in service contract pricing and higher installation and training revenues related to increased sales of our 3D Dimensions systems. The increase was also driven to a lesser extent by an increase in the number of service contracts in our Breast Health business as our installed base of our digital mammography systems continued to grow. 

Cost of Product Revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Product gross margin increased to 53.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to 48.8% in fiscal 2014.

Cost of Product Revenues. Cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2015 decreased in Diagnostics and Breast Health, and increased in GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health compared to fiscal 2014, resulting in an overall improved gross margin.

Diagnostics’ product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in product revenue related to the increase in Aptima assay sales and related volumes resulting in favorable manufacturing variances, higher blood screening revenues, lower production costs at our manufacturing facilities, lower royalty expenses primarily for ThinPrep due to the expiration of a royalty obligation during fiscal 2014, lower Cervista HPV sales, and lower molecular diagnostics instrumentation sales, which have very low gross margins. Partially offsetting these improvements was the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies.

Breast Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the favorable product mix shift to our higher margin 3D Dimensions system. Our 3D Dimensions systems have higher average sales prices than our 2D systems and sales in the U.S. have higher average sales prices than those sold internationally, resulting in higher gross margins. In addition, we had higher software sales for 3D upgrades and our C-View product, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, while we had lower revenues from our Hitec-Imaging business, which has lower gross margins than the majority of our Breast Health products. Partially offsetting these improvements was the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies.

48
GYN Surgical’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales volumes for our MyoSure system and product mix shift. The MyoSure system has slightly lower gross margins than our NovaSure system. In addition, in fiscal 2015 we recorded a $4.0 million charge to write-off certain inventory that would not be utilized. 

Skeletal Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in the average selling prices for both our Horizon and legacy Discovery products principally due to the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets. The decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets from the Cytyc Corporation acquisition, which are amortized based on the pattern of economic use, and the write-down in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and the eventual write-off of the MRI breast coils developed technology asset as a result of the divestiture of this product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Amortization expense in fiscal 2014 from the MRI breast coil product line was $9.1 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase due to certain in-process R&D projects from our Gen-Probe acquisition being completed in 2014 and reclassified to developed technology. The value assigned to these projects is now being amortized.

Impairment of Intangible Assets. There was no impairment of intangible assets in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we evaluated our MRI breast coils product line asset group, which was within our Breast Health segment, for impairment due to our expectation that it would be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by this asset group over its estimated remaining life were not sufficient to recover its carrying value. At that time, we estimated the fair value of the asset group resulting in an aggregate impairment charge of $28.6 million, comprised of $27.1 million of intangible assets and $1.5 million of property and equipment. The impairment charge was allocated to the long-lived assets, resulting in $26.6 million being allocated to developed technology. The MRI breast coils product line was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.

Cost of Service and Other Revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Service and other revenues gross margin was 50.0% in fiscal 2015 compared to 51.2% in fiscal 2014. Gross margin in fiscal 2015 was lower than fiscal 2014 as fiscal 2014 service and other revenues included $20.1 million of revenue from the Roka Bioscience, Inc. license amendment transaction, which did not have any corresponding costs. Excluding this transaction, gross margin would have improved by 1.2% in fiscal 2015. Within our Breast Health segment, gross margin improved primarily due to a favorable shift in service contract pricing and higher installation and training revenues related to our increased sales of 3D Dimensions systems. The increase was also driven to a lesser extent by the continued conversion of a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period improving leverage of our service infrastructure.

49
Operating Expenses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 5.8% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased compensation from higher headcount and variable compensation due to improved operating results, primarily in our Diagnostics and GYN Surgical segments, and additional program spend for our virology product line within our molecular diagnostics business, including increased clinical spending and higher spend for prototype materials. Partially offsetting these increases was lower spend of $3.5 million from our MRI breast coils product line as a result of the divestiture of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 9.4% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased commissions as a result of higher sales, an increase in spending on marketing initiatives primarily for our breast cancer awareness, Genius 3D mammography and cervical cancer awareness campaigns and higher training costs. These increases were partially offset by lower spend of $4.4 million from our MRI breast coils product line as a result of the divestiture of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, lower international headcount from restructuring actions, and lower travel expenses.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 0.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher variable compensation due to improved operating results and higher stock-based compensation, increased consulting expenses for a number of corporate initiatives and higher medical device excise taxes from increased U.S. product sales. These increases were partially offset by decreases in credit card fees related to customer sales, lower spend related to our MRI breast coils product line as a result of its divestiture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, decreases in certain non-income tax expenses, a reduction of bad debt expense, reduced legal and consulting fees related to shareholder activism, and lower headcount primarily internationally from restructuring actions. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets. The decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due lower amortization from intangibles acquired in the Cytyc Corporation acquisition in fiscal 2008 as the pattern of economic benefits decreased, partially offset by the shortening of the remaining life of certain corporate trade names as we decided to phase out their use during the second quarter of fiscal 2014.

Impairment of Intangible Assets. There was no impairment of intangible assets in fiscal 2015. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $5.1 million impairment charge for our existing in-process research and development projects from our Gen-Probe acquisition primarily due to a reduction in estimated future revenues from these products. Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded an impairment charge for a trade name intangible asset related to our MRI breast coils product line as previously discussed.

Restructuring and Divestiture Charges. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Gen-Probe, we implemented a restructuring action to consolidate our Diagnostics operations by decreasing headcount and transferring our legacy molecular diagnostics operations in Madison, Wisconsin. We also finalized our decision to transfer production of our interventional breast solutions products from our Indianapolis facility to our Costa Rica facility. In fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we implemented cost containment measures that primarily resulted in headcount reductions. In the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, we terminated certain personnel at our Hitec Imaging 

50
operation in Germany, and as part of ongoing management changes and structural refinement, we terminated certain executives and employees on a worldwide basis. Certain of these actions and related charges continued into fiscal 2015 and additional actions were taken in fiscal 2015 for executive management changes and to further consolidate operations. Pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the related severance and benefit charges are being recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or when benefits become probable for contractual and statutory benefits, and other charges are being recognized as incurred. In fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recorded aggregate charges of $28.5 million and $51.7 million, respectively, from these actions, primarily for severance and benefits and to a lesser extent facility closure costs. Included in the fiscal 2015 charges was a $9.6 million charge to write-off the cumulative translation adjustment related to the divestiture of our MRI breast coils product line. This subsidiary was deemed to be substantially liquidated in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as operations fully ceased. The charges recorded in fiscal 2014 primarily related to severance and benefits and included a $3.1 million impairment charge to record certain buildings at our Warstein, Germany location to their estimated fair value. In addition, the fiscal 2014 charges included a loss on divestiture of $5.3 million related to the sale of our MRI breast coils product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.

Interest Expense.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower outstanding balances as a result of principal payments, prepayments and extinguishments and lower interest rates as a result of debt restructurings, partially offset by the increase in interest expense for transaction fees that were expensed related to executing the new Credit Agreement and our 2022 Senior Notes.

Debt Extinguishment Loss.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.250% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Senior Notes"). We used the net proceeds of the 2022 Senior Notes, plus available cash to discharge the outstanding 6.25% Senior Notes due 2020 at an aggregate redemption price of $1.03 billion, reflecting a redemption premium payment of $31.25 million. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $22.3 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the redemption premium and debt issuance costs for extinguished lenders.

Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, on various dates, we entered into privately negotiated transactions and repurchased $300 million principal amount of our 2010 Notes for a total payment of $543.7 million, which includes the conversion premium resulting from our stock price on the date of transaction being in excess of the conversion price of $23.03. In connection with these transactions, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $15.5 million related to the difference between the fair value of the liability component of the 2010 Notes and their respective carrying value at the redemption date. The remaining cash payments were allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recorded within additional paid-in-capital within stockholders' equity.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into a new Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The initial net proceeds under the new Credit Agreement were used to refinance our obligations under our Prior Credit Agreement with Goldman Sachs Bank USA. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $18.2 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs under the existing facility.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we refinanced the Term Loan B facility of our Prior Credit Agreement and voluntarily prepaid $25.0 million of principal. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $4.5 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we made a $100.0 million voluntary pre-payment on the Term Loan B facility of our Prior Credit Agreement. As a result, the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs aggregating $2.9 million related to this prepayment was recorded as a debt extinguishment loss.

51
Other Income (Expense), net.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In fiscal 2015, this account was primarily comprised of an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $7.8 million on a marketable security, net foreign currency exchange losses of $2.9 million, and $1.0 million of losses on cash surrender value of life insurance contracts and mutual funds related to our deferred compensation plan.

In fiscal 2014, this account was primarily comprised of other-than-temporary impairment charges on cost-method equity investments of $6.9 million and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.8 million, partially offset by gains of $3.8 million on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts and mutual funds related to our deferred compensation plan. 

Provision for Income Taxes.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 25.8% compared to 63.9% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the domestic production activities deduction benefit. For fiscal 2014, the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to unbenefited foreign losses partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit.

Segment Results of Operations

Diagnostics. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased gross profit in absolute dollars and lower operating expenses. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased Aptima sales, higher blood screening revenues as a result of a full year of revenue from the agreement between Grifols and the Japanese Red Cross, favorable manufacturing variances and lower royalty expense, partially offset by a decrease in Cervista HPV volume, lower instrumentation sales and the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, also offsetting gross profit and margin in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 included $20.1 million of non-recurring revenue related to executing a license amendment with Roka Bioscience, Inc. with no corresponding costs. Overall, the gross margin improved to 49.3% in fiscal 2015 from 46.8% in fiscal 2014.

Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in headcount in general and administrative functions and sales and marketing, lower restructuring charges, and a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets. There were also lower bad debt expense and a decrease in non-income tax expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in spending on research and development for additional headcount and project spending, primarily for our virology product line, higher spend for various marketing initiatives and increased variable compensation from improved operating results. 

52
Breast Health.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the $97.1 million increase in product revenues discussed above and a $21.6 million increase in service revenues.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross profit in absolute dollars increased primarily due to the increase in 3D Dimensions sales, on both a unit basis and as a percentage of total digital mammography systems, compared to our 2D systems, an increase in software related sales, which have higher gross margins, and lower amortization expense primarily due to the divestiture of our MRI breast coils product in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, fiscal 2014 included a $26.6 million impairment charge for developed technology assets related to our MRI breast coils product line discussed above. Service revenues also improved in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in service contracts from our higher installed base. As a result, overall gross margin increased to 56.4% in fiscal 2015 compared to 50.1% in fiscal 2014.

Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in commissions from higher revenues, higher marketing expenditures primarily for our breast cancer awareness and Genius 3D campaigns, the $9.6 million charge to write-off the cumulative translation adjustment related to the divestiture of our MRI breast coils product line discussed above, and increased variable compensation from improved operating results. These expense increases were partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization expense, lower restructuring expenses, and lower MRI breast coils product line expenses (excluding restructuring) of $11.9 million as a result of its divestiture.

GYN Surgical.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

GYN Surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit in absolute dollars, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin increased to 57.3% in fiscal 2015 from 56.9% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the benefit of higher sales volume partially offset by a $4.0 million charge to write-off inventory that will not be utilized, a product mix shift to higher sales volume of MyoSure systems and the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies. 

Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in sales force headcount, higher commissions, increased costs associated with international sales initiatives, and increased research and development expenses as we develop next generation devices. These increases were partially offset by lower litigation fees. 

53
Skeletal Health.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Skeletal Health revenues increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in product revenues of $3.1 million discussed above which was partially offset by a slight decrease in service and other revenue. 

Operating income decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher compensation from improved operating results and additional investment in research and development projects. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At September 24, 2016, we had $424.7 million of working capital, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $548.4 million. Our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $57.1 million during fiscal 2016 principally due to cash generated through operating activities, partially offset by payments to extinguish certain of our Convertible Notes, repurchase common stock and make capital expenditures.

In fiscal 2016, our operating activities provided us with $787.2 million of cash, which included net income of $330.8 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $465.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $65.4 million and non-cash interest expense of $52.1 million related to our outstanding debt. These adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $155.8 million, primarily from the amortization of intangible assets, and a gain on the sale of a marketable security of $25.1 million. Cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of $56.4 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in accrued expenses of $45.6 million related to the timing of accruals for income and other taxes and an increase in accrued compensation, an increase in accounts payable of $40.1 million due to the timing of payments as we have extended the payment terms with our vendors to be more in-line with industry norms, and a decrease in inventory of $7.6 million primarily due to an increase in sales. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $31.8 million due to the increase in revenue and timing of cash receipts.

In fiscal 2016, we used $68.4 million of cash from investing activities, primarily related to $94.5 million for capital expenditures, which consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchases of manufacturing equipment and computer hardware, partially offset by cash received from the sale of a marketable security for $31.1 million.

In fiscal 2016, our financing activities used cash of $659.7 million, primarily for payments to extinguish certain of our Convertible Notes of $392.8 million, repurchases of common stock of $250.0 million, net payments of $175.0 million under our revolving line of credit, payments related to our long term debt under our Credit Agreement of $75.0 million and payments of $16.4 million for employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $200.0 million borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization program and proceeds of $38.5 million from our equity compensation plans.

Debt

We had total recorded debt outstanding of $3.3 billion at September 24, 2016, which is comprised of amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement of $1.39 billion (principal $1.41 billion), our 2022 Senior Notes of $1.0 billion and our convertible notes of $775.7 million (principal $745.7 million), which includes accretion of interest at 4.0% per annum on the 2013 Notes, and amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization program of $200.0 million.

Credit Agreement

The credit facilities under the Credit Agreement consist of: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

54
•A secured revolving credit facility under which the Borrowers (as defined below) may borrow up to $1 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a final maturity date of May 29, 2020 or the Revolver, of which none was outstanding at September 24, 2016.

Borrowings are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of the assets of our U.S. subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. For example, borrowings under the Credit Agreement are not secured by those accounts receivable that we transfer to the special purpose entity under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. As of September 24, 2016, the interest rate under the Term Loan and Revolver was 2.05% on the outstanding amounts, which is reflective of the Eurocurrency Rate (i.e., Libor) plus the applicable margin of 1.50% per annum as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin is subject to specified changes depending on the total net leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. 

We are required to make scheduled principal payments under the Term Loan in increasing amounts ranging from $18.75 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on September 25, 2015 to $37.5 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on September 28, 2018. The remaining balance of the Term Loan is due at maturity. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolver are due at maturity. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, we are required to make certain mandatory prepayments from specified excess cash flows from operations (to the extent our net senior secured leverage ratio exceeds a certain ratio) and from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights) (“Mandatory Prepayments”). Mandatory Prepayments are required to be applied by us, first, to the Term Loan, second, to any outstanding amount under the swing line sublimit, third, to the Revolver, and fourth to any outstanding amount under a letter of credit sublimit. Subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily prepay any of the credit facilities under the Credit Agreement without premium or penalty. 

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability and that of the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of our businesses. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross defaults and an event of default upon a change of control of the company.

The Credit Agreement contains total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and an excess cash flow prepayment requirement measured as of the end of each fiscal year. As of September 24, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants, and no Mandatory Prepayments were required as of September 24, 2016.

Senior Notes

On July 2, 2015, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Senior Notes. The 2022 Senior Notes are our general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The 2022 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2022 and bear interest at the rate of 5.250% per year, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2016.

 We may redeem the 2022 Senior Notes at any time prior to July 15, 2018 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. We may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before July 15, 2018, at a redemption price equal to 105.250% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We also have the option to redeem the 2022 Senior Notes on or after: July 15, 2018 through July 14, 2019 at 102.625% of par; July 15, 2019 through July 14, 2020 at 101.313% of par; and July 15, 2020 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if we undergo a change of control, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2022 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

Convertible Notes

At September 24, 2016, our convertible notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $745.7 million, are recorded at $775.7 million, which includes accretion of interest at 4.0% per annum on the 2013 Notes and is net of the unamortized debt discount attributed to the embedded conversion feature of the convertible notes and deferred issuance costs. At September 24, 2016, these notes consisted of:

•$12.3 million of our 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037 issued in November 2010 (2010 Notes);

•$363.4 million of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2042 issued in March 2012 (2012 Notes); and

55
•$370.0 million of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2043 issued in February 2013 (2013 Notes).

The 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes are collectively referred to herein as the convertible notes. Interest on the 2013 Notes is currently being accreted to principal, from their date of issuance, at a rate of 4.00% per year until December 15, 2017, and 2.00% per year thereafter. All other notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the original principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears until their first put date and thereafter accrete principal at the rate of 2.00% per year. In addition, under certain circumstances contingent interest may be payable under the convertible notes after each of their first put date. 

The 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes have conversion prices of approximately $23.03, $31.175 and $38.59, respectively, and are subject in each case to adjustment. Holders of the 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes may convert their convertible notes at the applicable conversion price under certain circumstances, including without limitation (x) if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter and (y) if the applicable series of convertible notes has been called for redemption. It is our current intent and policy to settle any conversion of the convertible notes as if we had elected to make either a net share settlement or all cash election, such that upon conversion, we intend to pay the holders in cash for the principal amount of the convertible notes and, if applicable shares of our common stock or cash to satisfy the premium based on a calculated daily conversion value. On November 9, 2016, we announced that as provided in the indenture for the 2010 Notes, we had made an irrevocable election to settle any conversion of the 2010 Notes validly submitted on or after November 9, 2016 in cash. 

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2010 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter. Therefore holders of the 2010 Notes are able to convert their notes during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As such, we classified the $12.2 million carrying value of our 2010 Notes (which had a principal value of $12.3 million at September 24, 2016) as a current debt obligation. As of September 24, 2016, the if-converted value of the 2010 Notes exceeded the aggregate principal amount by approximately $7.9 million.

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2010 Notes on each of December 15, 2016, 2020, 2025, on December 13, 2030 and on December 14, 2035, or upon a fundamental change as provided in the indenture for the 2010 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On November 9, 2016, we announced that we would repurchase, on December 15, 2016, all of the outstanding 2010 Notes at a repurchase price payable in cash equal to 100% of the original principal amount of the 2010 Notes validly surrendered for repurchase and not withdrawn plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, December 15, 2016, at the option of the holders of the 2010 Notes.

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2012 Notes on each of March 1, 2018, 2022, 2027 and 2032, and on March 2, 2037, or upon a fundamental change as provided in the indenture for the 2012 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Holders may require us to repurchase the 2013 Notes on each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 and 2037, or upon a fundamental change as provided in the indenture for the 2013 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We may redeem any of the 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes beginning December 19, 2016, March 6, 2018, and December 15, 2017, respectively. As discussed above, holders of the convertible notes may elect to convert their notes prior to redemption. We may redeem all or a portion of the 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes (i.e., in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock) at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. On November 9, 2016, we announced that we had elected to redeem, on December 19, 2016, all of the outstanding 2010 Notes (those 2010 Notes not put to us on December 15, 2016 or validly submitted for conversion prior to December 16, 2016) at a redemption price payable in cash equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the 2010 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest, if any) to, but not including, December 19, 2016. We also announced on November 9, 2016 that as provided in the indenture for the 2010 Notes, we had made an irrevocable election to settle any conversion of the 2010 Notes validly submitted on or after November 9, 2016 in cash. 

We have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to our convertible notes original issuance discount, representing the spread between the stated cash coupon rate and the higher interest rate that is deductible for tax purposes based on the type of security. When our convertible notes are extinguished, we are required to recapture the original issuance discount previously deducted for tax purposes. The tax recapture, however, decreases as the fair market value of the convertible notes and the amount paid on settlement increases.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Program

On April 25, 2016, we entered into a one-year $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the "Securitization Program") with several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions. Under the terms of the Securitization Program, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries sell our customer receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is wholly-owned by us. In addition, we also contributed a portion of our customer receivables to the special purpose entity in connection with its establishment. We retain servicing responsibility. The special purpose entity, as borrower, and we, as servicer, have entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with several lenders pursuant to which the special purpose entity may borrow from the lenders up to $200.0 million, with the loans secured by the receivables. The amount that the special purpose entity may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying receivables that are present in the special purpose entity at such point in time. The entire amount available was borrowed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program bear interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin of 0.7% and are included as a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of net receivables in our consolidated balance sheet. As of September 24, 2016, the interest rate under the Securitization Program was 1.22% on the outstanding amounts. We and the special purpose entity are operated and maintained as separate legal entities. The assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. The special purpose entity is not a guarantor under our Credit Agreement and is not a guarantor of our 2022 Senior Notes.

The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, and an event of default upon a change of control. In addition, it contains financial covenants consistent with that of the Credit Agreement. As of September 24, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Stock Repurchase Program

On June 21, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock over the next five years. There were no repurchases of common stock made under this authorization during fiscal 2016.

57
Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 24, 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2)The financing leases represent two leases for an office building and a manufacturing facility, which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.

(3)Purchase obligations primarily represent minimum purchase commitments for inventory and instruments and, to a lesser extent, other operating expense commitments.

(4)Represents minimum royalties due on net sales of products incorporating licensed technology and subject to a minimum annual royalty payment, and payments under collaborative agreements. In addition to the minimum payments due under our collaborative agreements included above, we may be required to pay up to $5.3 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on net sales of any products using specified technology.

(5)Pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of $37.0 million, which is recorded as a current liability. Deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.

The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under FIN 48 (codified primarily in ASC 740, Income Taxes) totaling $167.6 million. Due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits. 

Future Liquidity Considerations

We expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions and alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business. Subject to the Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and the general disclaimers set forth in our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report, we believe that cash flow from operations and the cash available under our Revolver and permitted accounts receivable securitization program will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations, and debt payments, including interest over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions or other investments, or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities. As described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Agreement, 2022 Senior Notes, convertible notes and accounts receivable securitization program. These capital requirements could be substantial. Our operating performance may also be affected by 

58
matters discussed under the above-referenced Risk Factors set forth elsewhere in this report. These risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.

Legal Contingencies

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. In connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory

Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. As a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment and diagnostic test kits, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures on products and prices, and reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product expiration or end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future. If inventory is determined to be overvalued, excess or obsolete, we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results.

Accounts Receivable Reserves

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors, including discussions with the customer to determine the cause of non-payment, and evaluation of the customer’s current financial situation. In the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us, we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer’s current credit worthiness. We continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. 

59
While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

We also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. If the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected.

Business Combinations

We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. Contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario. These cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate. Quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimate of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. 

We generally use the income approach in which cash flow projections on an after-tax basis are discounted using a risk adjusted rate to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, customer relationships and contracts, and trade names. Developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know-how. Customer relationships represent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. Trade names represent acquired company and product names.

With respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. Generally, we apply the cost approach as the primary method in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Intangible Assets

We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 30 years. We review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. In the event an indicator of impairment is identified, we perform an analysis comparing the undiscounted cash flow the asset group is expected to generate over its remaining economic life to its carrying value. The undiscounted cash flows are based on management's assumptions on the asset group's use in the future. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write-down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. In assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. We generally determine fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life has changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.

Goodwill

We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Events that 

60
could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.

In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC 350. The first step requires a comparison of the reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. The valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies. We base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, of market participants. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. The second step requires us to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation as of the measurement date and estimate the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets is determined as described above and is subject to significant judgment.

We conducted our fiscal 2016 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We utilized discounted cash flows, or DCF, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 26, 2016 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. As a result of completing Step 1, all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required for those reporting units. For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each of our reporting units been lower by 10%, all of our reporting units would still have passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.

Since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the DCF, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the WACC, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, significant judgment is applied in determining fair value. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher WACC because market participants would require a higher rate of return. In the DCF as the WACC increases, the fair value decreases. The other significant factor in the DCF is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit.

At September 24, 2016, we believe that all reporting units with goodwill aggregating $2.8 billion were not at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on our current forecasts.

We conducted our fiscal 2015 and 2014 annual impairment tests on the first day of the respective year's fourth quarter. We used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement dates. As a result of completing Step 1, all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment tests were not required. 

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of products, primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems.

We recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Generally, our product arrangements for capital equipment sales, primarily in our Breast Health and Skeletal Health reporting segments, are multiple-element arrangements, including services, such as installation and training, and multiple products. In accordance with ASC 605-25, based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements, we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, revenue for services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as such services are performed. The relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered. There is no customer right of return in our sales agreements.

Service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty, installation and training, and shipping and handling costs billed to customers. Service and maintenance contract 

61
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed.

For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we record revenue as separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control. Some of our products have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality. We determined that except for our CAD products and C-View product, the software element in our other products is incidental and not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, ASC 985-605, Software—Revenue Recognition. We determined that given the significance of the software component’s functionality to our CAD and C-View systems, which are sold by our Breast Health segment, these products are within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. We evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our other hardware products, including our Dimensions digital mammography systems, which have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products’ essential functionality (i.e., it is a tangible product), and determined they are not within the scope of ASC 985-605.

We are required to allocate revenue to multiple element arrangements based on the relative fair value of each element’s selling price. We typically determine the selling price of our products based on our best estimate of selling price, referred to as ESP, and services based on vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, referred to as VSOE. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution, and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining VSOE. If VSOE cannot be established, which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent, or product pricing is not within a narrow range, we will generally establish the selling price using ESP to allocate arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross margin objectives, method of distribution, information gathered from experience in customer negotiations, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies.

For those arrangements accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules, ASC 985-605 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative VSOE of fair value. If VSOE does not exist for a delivered element, the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their VSOE with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements. For multiple-element software arrangements where VSOE of fair value of Post-Contract Customer Support, referred to as PCS, has been established, we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

As part of our Diagnostics reporting segment, we manufacture blood screening products according to demand schedules provided by our collaboration partner, Grifols. Our agreement provides that we share a portion of Grifols’s revenue from screening blood donations. Upon shipment to Grifols, we recognize blood screening product sales at an agreed upon fixed transfer price, which is not refundable, and record the related cost of products sold. Based on the terms of our collaboration agreement with Grifols, our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user in excess of the transfer price revenues recognized is not known until it is reported to us by Grifols. On a monthly basis, Grifols reports net revenue generated during the prior month and remits an additional corresponding net payment to us which we record as revenue at that time. This payment combined with the transfer price revenues previously recognized represents our ultimate share of net revenue under the agreement.

While the majority of our instruments are placed at customer sites, in certain instances, we sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers and record sales of these instruments upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the arrangement. 

Within our Diagnostics business and, to a lesser extent, our GYN Surgical business, we provide our instrumentation (for example, the ThinPrep Processor, ThinPrep Imaging System, Panther and Tigris) and certain other hardware to customers without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into a lease. Instead, we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation and equipment in the amount we charge for our diagnostic tests and assays and other disposables. Customers enter into a customer usage agreement, and we install the equipment at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term, which is typically between three and five years. Revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as tests, assays and other disposable products are shipped or delivered, depending on the customer arrangement. 

62
Stock-Based Compensation

We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with the granting of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units issued to our employees. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor’s model. The model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:

Expected volatility—We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility, which is weighted based on a number of factors.

Expected term—We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.

Risk-free interest rate—The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. ASC 718, Stock Compensation, requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on an analysis of historical forfeitures, we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 7.0% as of September 24, 2016 depending on the specific employee group. This analysis is re-evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.

We granted performance stock units to members of our senior management team during fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016. Each recipient of a performance stock unit is eligible to receive between zero and 200% of the target number of shares of our common stock at the end of three years provided our defined Return on Invested Capital, or ROIC, metrics are achieved. We recognize compensation expense ratably over the required service period based on an estimate of the probability that the measurement criteria will be achieved for a targeted number of shares. Our estimate of the number of shares that are probable of vesting is based on our estimate of ROIC over the respective time periods using our internal forecasts and projections. If there is a change in the estimate of the number of shares that are probable of vesting, we will cumulatively adjust compensation expense in the period that the change in estimate is made.

We recognized $65.4 million, $59.3 million and $50.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of September 24, 2016, there was $21.2 million and $66.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and stock units, respectively, that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years and 2.0 years, respectively.

Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between our assets and liabilities financial reporting and taxes bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.

We have recognized $973.3 million in net deferred tax liabilities at September 24, 2016 and $1.16 billion at September 26, 2015. The liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and debt. The tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and the character of such income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we could realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.

At September 24, 2016, we had $163.6 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $80.1 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. At September 26, 2015, we had $154.7 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $74.9 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate. I

63
n the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to $1.0 million due to expiring statutes of limitations.

In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. While we consider our estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the income statement as income tax expense (or benefit) in the period in which the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230). The guidance reduces diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Statements of Cash Flows. Certain of ASU 2016-15 requirements are as follows: 1) cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, 2) contingent consideration payments made soon after a business combination should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities and cash payment made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing up to the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the acquisition date with any excess classified as operating activities, 3) cash proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss, 4) cash proceeds from the settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI) Policies should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities and cash payments for premiums on COLI policies may be classified as cash outflows for investing activities, operating activities, or a combination of investing and operating activities, and 5) cash paid to a tax authority by an employer when withholding shares from an employee's award for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The guidance requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected credit losses during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Entities will be required to recognize income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes by providing for withholding at the employee's maximum rate as opposed to the minimum rate without triggering liability accounting and by allowing an entity-wide policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of its leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance

requires a modified retrospective adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This guidance changes how entities measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will be required to measure these investments at fair value at the end of each reporting period and recognize changes in fair value in net income. A practicability exception will be available for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, however; the exception requires the Company to consider relevant transactions that can be reasonably known to identify any observable price changes that would impact the fair value. This guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current US GAAP. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 330, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The new guidance requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This new guidance is effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The guidance must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this requirement on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. This guidance focuses on a reporting company’s consolidation evaluation to determine whether certain legal entities should be consolidated. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently evaluating this guidance, but do not anticipate that adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate, at each annual or interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that exist that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and is applicable to us in fiscal 2018. Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 660), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. This ASU is applicable to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current U.S. GAAP. These judgments may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted in favor of delaying the effective date of the new standard by one year, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. ASU 2014-09 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
