ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

American Airlines Group  

As previously discussed, the Merger was consummated on December 9, 2013. Accordingly, our consolidated results include US Airways Group for the full year ended December 31, 2014. For 2013, our consolidated results include US Airways Group only for the 23 days ended December 31, 2013.  

We continue to move toward operating under the single brand name of American Airlines through our mainline operating subsidiaries, American and US Airways. Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle and US Airways Express, our airlines operate an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to 339 destinations in 54 countries from our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2014, we had approximately 197 million passengers boarding our mainline and regional flights. As of December 31, 2014, we operated 983 mainline jets and were supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 566 regional aircraft. We have made substantial progress towards integrating the operations of our mainline operating subsidiaries and towards obtaining a single operating certificate, which we expect to obtain in 2015. The following are additional significant integration accomplishments in 2014:  

       Completed airport co-locations for 75% of the airports where we have joint operations.  

       Launched a US Airways codeshare with British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin and Finnair, fully integrating it into Americans Trans-Atlantic Joint Business Agreement with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair.  

       Reached a new five-year joint collective bargaining agreement with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants for the airlines combined flight attendants.  

       Reached a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the Allied Pilots Association for the airlines combined pilots (ratified in January 2015).  

       Broke ground on the state-of-the-art Robert W. Baker Integrated Operations Center.  

See Part I, Item 1. Business  Chapter 11 Reorganization and Merger for more information related to our emergence from Chapter 11 and Merger.  

Year in Review  

The U.S. Airline Industry  

In 2014, the U.S. airline industry continued to experience year-over-year growth in passenger revenues driven by strong demand for air travel.  

In its most recent data available, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported that annual U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields increased 4.2% and 1.8%, respectively, as compared to 2013. With respect to international versus domestic performance, Airlines for America reported that domestic markets outperformed international markets. Atlantic and Latin America markets experienced year-over-year growth in passenger revenues of 2.8% and 3.4%, respectively, while the Pacific market experienced year-over-year declines in passenger revenues of 1.4%.  

Jet fuel prices continue to follow the price of Brent crude oil more closely than the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. On average, fuel costs were lower in 2014 as compared to 2013, driven by a significant decline in fuel prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. On December 31, 2014, the price of Brent crude oil fell to $55 per barrel, its lowest price since May 2009.

While the U.S. airline industry is currently benefiting from a favorable revenue environment and significantly reduced fuel prices as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these factors. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business and Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.   

American Airlines Group  

Our 2014 GAAP results are not comparable to the GAAP results for 2013 as a result of the Merger, which closed on December 9, 2013. Additionally, US Airways Group applied acquisition accounting as of December 9, 2013 and its financial statements after December 9, 2013 are deemed not comparable to its financial statements for periods prior to the Merger.  

To provide a basis for comparison to prior year results, we have presented in the table below certain combined 2013 financial data which includes the financial results of AAG and US Airways Group, each on a standalone basis. While this is a non-GAAP measure, management believes this presentation provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Percent change is a comparison of the combined results.  

 (2)  AAGs 2014 results were significantly impacted by net special charges of $1.3 billion. Significant components of net special charges include $818 million of merger integration expenses, a $330 million non-cash special income tax charge relating to the sale of our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts, and $132 million of nonoperating special charges primarily related to debt extinguishments, bankruptcy obligations, and Venezuela foreign currency losses. See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  AAGs Results of Operations of this report for more information on net special items.  

 (3)  Combined results exclude $13 million of US Airways Group special nonoperating other, net expense, which was eliminated in consolidation with AAG. This expense represented a non-cash mark-to-market fair value adjustment for US Airways Groups 7.25% convertible senior notes that were convertible into shares of AAG common stock subsequent to the Merger.  

Driven by growth in revenues resulting from strong demand for air travel, we realized operating income of $4.2 billion and net income of $2.9 billion in 2014. This compares to combined operating income of $2.6 billion  

68  

Table of Contents 

 and a combined net loss of $1.2 billion for 2013. Our 2014 net income included net operating and total net special charges of $824 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of net operating special charges, we recognized operating income of $5.1 billion in 2014, which is a $1.8 billion, or 57%, improvement as compared to combined operating income of $3.2 billion excluding net operating special charges in 2013. Excluding the effects of total net special charges, we recognized net income of $4.2 billion in 2014, which is a $2.2 billion, or 115%, improvement as compared to combined net income of $1.9 billion excluding total net special charges in 2013. See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  AAGs Results of Operations of this report for more information on net special charges.  

Revenue  

In 2014, we reported operating revenues of $42.7 billion. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $37.1 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 4.5%, as compared to the 2013 combined mainline and regional passenger revenues of $35.5 billion. The growth in revenues was driven by a 3.3% increase in yield and 1.1% increase in revenue passenger miles as total capacity increased 2.2%, as compared to 2013. Our combined mainline and regional passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was 13.97 cents in 2014, a 2.2% increase, as compared to a combined 13.67 cents in 2013.  

Fuel  

Mainline and regional fuel expense was $12.6 billion in 2014, which was $616 million, or 4.7%, lower as compared to the combined mainline and regional fuel expense in 2013. This decrease was driven by a 5.5% decrease in the average price per gallon to $2.91 in 2014 from a combined average price per gallon of $3.08 in 2013. This decrease was offset in part by a 0.9% increase in consumption.  

During the second quarter of 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our fuel consumption since December 9, 2013 and, accordingly, as of December 31, 2014, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.  

Capacity  

Total system capacity for the combined company increased 2.2% in 2014 as compared to the combined 2013 period, primarily due to more active aircraft and larger gauge aircraft replacing smaller legacy aircraft.  

Cost Control  

We remain committed to actively managing and maintaining a low cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel. Our 2014 mainline cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding special items and fuel was 8.63 cents. When compared to the 2013 combined results, mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel increased 2.0% in 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by Merger-related labor contracts and higher maintenance costs driven by an increase in the rate per engine overhaul. See below for the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information.  

Customer Service  

During 2014, we worked to enhance our customers experience by continuing our fleet renewal program, under which we expect to achieve one of the most modern and fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. During 2014,  

69  

Table of Contents 

 we took delivery of 82 mainline aircraft and retired 69 older legacy mainline aircraft. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced $2.0 billion in planned customer improvements, including new seats from nose to tail on several aircraft types and fully lie-flat seats on our long-haul international fleet; satellite-based internet access providing connectivity for international flights; a refreshed and modern design for Admirals Club lounges worldwide; onboard power on new aircraft; and improved and updated kiosks to expedite airport check-in.  

Most importantly, we are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable, and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. Our 2014 operating performance was negatively impacted in part by severe weather conditions at our hubs as well as the September 2014 fire at the FAAs Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center, which caused significant flight delays and cancellations. We reported the following combined operating statistics to the DOT for mainline operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Represents the combined historical operating statistics for American and US Airways.  

 (b)  Percentage of reported flight operations arriving on time as defined by the DOT.  

 (c)  Percentage of scheduled flight operations completed.  

 (d)  Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.  

 (e)  Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.  

Liquidity Position  

As of December 31, 2014, AAGs total cash, short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments were $8.1 billion, of which $774 million was restricted. We also had a $1.8 billion undrawn revolving line of credit facility.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  As of December 31, 2014, approximately $656 million of our unrestricted cash and short-term investment balance was held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance includes approximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars and approximately $35 million valued at 12.0 bolivars, with the rate depending on the date we submitted our repatriation request to the Venezuelan government. These rates are materially more favorable than the exchange rates currently prevailing for other transactions conducted outside of the Venezuelan governments currency exchange system that we participate in. Our cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars decreased $54 million from the December 31, 2013 balance of $710 million primarily due to $88 million in cash repatriations and $30 million in foreign currency losses as described below, partially offset by additional cash proceeds from ticket sales in early 2014. In the second and third quarters of 2014, we repatriated $65 million including $31 million valued at 6.3 bolivars to the dollar and $34 million valued at 10.6 bolivars to the dollar. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we incurred an $11 million foreign currency loss related to the receipt of $23 million at a rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar for one of our 2012 repatriation requests originally valued at a rate of 4.3 bolivars to the dollar. Accordingly, we revalued our remaining  

70  

Table of Contents 

     pending 2012 repatriation requests from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the dollar resulting in additional foreign currency losses of $19 million. In total, we recognized a $30 million special charge for these foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. During 2014, we significantly reduced capacity in this market and we are no longer accepting bolivars as payment for airline tickets. We are continuing to work with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. We are monitoring this situation closely and continue to evaluate our holdings of Venezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses, which could be material, particularly in light of the uncertainty posed by the new foreign exchange regulations announced in mid-February 2015 and the continued deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.  

 (2)  Restricted cash and investments primarily include cash collateral to secure workers compensation claims.  

In 2014, we utilized cash generated from operations to pay down certain higher rate debt and lease obligations, to make supplemental contributions to our pension plans and to return value to our shareholders by reducing our diluted share count through the repurchase program and paying our first cash dividend since 1980. We declared cash dividends of $0.10 per share for shareholders of record on August 4, 2014 and have continued to declare a dividend of $0.10 per share in each quarter thereafter.  

These cash outflows were offset in part by certain new debt issuances to strengthen our liquidity position. Further information on our significant transactions affecting our liquidity position in 2014 is as follows:  

Debt Repayments  

       We prepaid $1.0 billion of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes.  

       We prepaid approximately $1.2 billion of various high cost aircraft debt and lease obligations. Of this amount, $155 million was a reduction of debt on our balance sheet. The remaining portion of these obligations was accounted for as an operating lease.  

       We prepaid or repurchased $646 million of obligations associated with special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities to build or improve certain airport and maintenance facilities. Of this amount, $366 million was a reduction of debt on our balance sheet. The remaining portion of these obligations was accounted for as an operating lease.  

Reductions in Diluted Share Count  

       In 2014, we repurchased 23.4 million shares of AAG Common Stock for $1.0 billion, completing the $1.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on July 23, 2014. In January 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016.  

       In 2014, we withheld approximately 9 million shares of AAG Common Stock and paid approximately $325 million in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with distributions under the Plan and employee equity awards.  

       We redeemed US Airways Groups 7.25% convertible notes for $175 million in cash in lieu of issuing 4 million shares of AAG Common Stock.  

Pension Prefunding  

       In 2014, we made $639 million in supplemental contributions to fund our pension plans. These contributions are above and beyond the $171 million aggregate amount of minimum required contributions made in 2014.  

71  

Table of Contents 

New Debt Issuances  

       In September 2014, AAG issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2019 (the 5.50% senior notes). Also in September 2014, American issued $957 million in equipment notes related to the 2014-1 Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates to finance unencumbered aircraft.  

       In October 2014, American borrowed $750 million under a new term loan facility due in 2021 and arranged a $400 million revolving credit facility due in 2019. American also increased its existing revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion and extended its maturity date from 2018 to 2019.  

2015 Outlook  

We have taken significant actions to restore our competitiveness and to complete our integration. Although it is difficult to predict the price of oil or the strength of the economy, we believe that our 2014 financial results are evidence of the substantial progress we have made and can continue to build on.  

Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information  

We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

AAGs Results of Operations  

In 2014, we realized operating income of $4.2 billion and net income of $2.9 million. Our 2014 net income included net special operating charges of $824 million and total net special charges of $1.3 billion. Excluding the effects of these special charges, we realized operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $4.2 billion.  

We completed the Merger on December 9, 2013. Under GAAP, AAGs results do not include the financial results of US Airways Group prior to the closing of the Merger. Accordingly, our 2014 period GAAP results are not comparable to the GAAP results for the 2013 or 2012 periods as those periods exclude the results of US Airways Group except for the 23 day post-Merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  

When compared to the combined separate company results of AAG and US Airways Group for 2013, our 2014 net income excluding net special charges improved by $2.2 billion. In 2013, on a standalone basis, AAG reported a net loss of $1.6 billion and US Airways Group reported net income of $392 million. Excluding the effects of net special charges, AAG and US Airways Group reported 2013 net income of $1.2 billion and $786 million, respectively.  

When compared to the combined separate company results of AAG and US Airways Group for 2012, our 2013 combined net income excluding net special charges improved by $1.5 billion. In 2012, on a standalone basis, AAG reported a net loss of $1.9 billion and US Airways Group reported net income of $637 million. Excluding the effects of net special charges, AAG reported a 2012 net loss of $130 million and US Airways Group reported net income of $537 million.  

The components of net special items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations are as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  In 2013, other revenue special item, net included a credit to other revenues related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of AAGs AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.  

 (2)  In 2014, mainline operating special items, net included $810 million of Merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance and retention, share-based compensation, divestiture of London Heathrow Slots, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training. In addition, we recorded a net charge of $81 million for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations, $164 million in other special charges, including an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values, and other spare parts asset impairments, as well as $54 million in charges primarily relating to the buyout of certain aircraft leases. These charges were offset in part by a $309 million gain on the sale of Slots at DCA.  

In 2013, mainline operating special items, net included $443 million of primarily Merger related expenses due to the alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation and fees for US Airways to exit the Star Alliance and its codeshare agreement with United Airlines. In addition, we recorded a $107 million charge related to Americans pilot long-term disability obligation, a $43 million  

73  

Table of Contents 

 charge for workers compensation claims and a $33 million aircraft impairment charge. These charges were offset in part by a $67 million gain on the sale of Slots at LaGuardia Airport.  

In 2012, mainline operating special items, net consisted of $386 million of severance and related charges and write-off of leasehold improvements on aircraft and airport facilities that were rejected in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.  

 (3)  In 2014, nonoperating special items, net consisted principally of $43 million for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of our 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness and $33 million of non-cash interest accretion on bankruptcy settlement obligations. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of our cash held in Venezuelan bolivars.  

In 2013, nonoperating special items, net consisted of interest charges of $138 million primarily to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan and penalty interest related to 10.5% secured notes and 7.50% senior secured notes, a $54 million charge related to the premium on tender for existing enhanced equipment trust certificates financings and the write-off of debt issuance costs and $19 million in charges related to the repayment of existing EETC financings.  

In 2012, nonoperating special items, net consisted of a $280 million benefit resulting from a settlement of a commercial dispute.  

 (4)  In 2013 and 2012, we recognized reorganization expenses as a result of the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. These amounts consisted primarily of estimated allowed claim amounts and professional fees.  

 (5)  In 2014, income tax special items, net were $346 million. During 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, we recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), a subset of stockholders equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, we retained the $330 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated. In addition, we recorded a special $16 million non-cash deferred income tax provision related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.  

In 2013 and 2012, income tax special items, net included, respectively, a $538 million and a $569 million non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations. We are required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which was exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, our year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The 2013 tax benefit was offset in part by a $214 million tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.  

Income Taxes  

At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $10.1 billion of gross NOL Carryforwards to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2015. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. These NOL Carryforwards include an unrealized tax benefit of $867 million related to the implementation of share-based compensation accounting guidance that will  

74  

Table of Contents 

 be recorded in equity when realized. We also had approximately $4.6 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2014, which will expire in years 2015 through 2034 if unused. Our ability to deduct our NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 where an ownership change has occurred. We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. As a result of the Merger, US Airways Group is now included in the AAG consolidated federal and state income tax return. The general limitation rules of Section 382 for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permit approximately $9.0 billion of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the Section 382 annual limitation rules. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group) are subject to limitation under Section 382; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless another ownership change occurs.  

At December 31, 2014, we had an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforward of approximately $341 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period. Our net deferred tax assets, which include the NOL Carryforwards, are subject to a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2014, the federal and state valuation allowances were $4.5 billion and $264 million, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, utilization of the NOL Carryforwards after December 9, 2013 will result in a corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance and offset our tax provision dollar for dollar.  

We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (primarily reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider many factors in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets including risks associated with merger integration as well as other factors, which continue to be affected by conditions beyond our control, such as the condition of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand. We have concluded as of December 31, 2014 that the valuation allowance was still needed on our deferred tax asset based on the weight of the factors described above.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $330 million tax provision. This provision included $346 million of special tax charges as described above. In addition, we recorded $8 million of tax expense principally related to certain states and countries where NOL Carryforwards were limited or unavailable to be used. These charges were offset in part by a $24 million federal income tax benefit resulting from our elections under applicable sections of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014), allowing corporations to accelerate utilization of certain research and AMT credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.  

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $346 million tax benefit. This benefit included $324 million of net special tax benefits as described above. In addition, we recorded a $22 million federal income tax benefit under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 as described above.  

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a $569 million special tax benefit as described above.

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2014 consisted principally of net foreign currency losses of $114 million and early debt extinguishment charges of $56 million. Other nonoperating expense, net in 2013 consisted principally of net foreign currency losses of $56 million and early debt extinguishment charges of $29 million. Other nonoperating expense, net increased $64 million, or 73.1%, during 2014 primarily due to special charges recognized as a result of early debt extinguishment and an increase in foreign currency losses driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in foreign currency transactions, principally in Latin American markets. We recorded a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses in 2014. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of our cash held in Venezuelan bolivars. In addition, our 2014 nonoperating special items included $56 million primarily related to the early extinguishment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness.

 (1)  In exchange for employees contributions to the successful reorganization, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, we agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim, which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion.  

 (2)  Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing or facility agreement when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note 2 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.  

 (3)  Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of $180 million, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK, and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.

Total operating expenses in 2013 were $24.2 billion as compared to $24.7 billion in 2012, a decrease of $471 million, or 1.9%. Significant changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $77 million, or 1.0%, due to a decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel, offset in part by an increase in gallons consumed.  

       Salaries, wages, and benefits decreased $941 million, or 15.1%, due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan as well as effects related to the freezing of Americans pension plans in 2012.  

       Aircraft rent increased $190 million, or 34.4%, as a result of new leased aircraft deliveries in 2013 as we continued our fleet renewal program.  

       Selling expenses increased $69 million, or 6.5%, as a result of higher commissions and credit card fees related to the increase in passenger revenues.  

       Other operating expenses increased $225 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to higher costs associated with outsourced services and enhanced customer product offerings.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses, excluding the results of US Airways Group, increased $84 million, or 2.8%, in 2013 to $3.1 billion from $3.0 billion in 2012. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a $44 million, or 4.4%, increase in fuel costs and a $40 million, or 2.0%, increase in other regional operating expenses due to an increase in capacity. The increase in fuel costs was driven by higher fuel consumption due to the transition from turboprop to regional jet aircraft.

Americans Results of Operations  

In 2014, American realized operating income of $2.3 billion and net income of $1.3 billion. Americans 2014 period net income included net special operating charges of $512 million and total net special charges of $974 million. Excluding the effects of these special charges, American realized operating income of $2.9 billion and net income of $2.3 billion.  

In 2013, American realized operating income of $1.5 billion and a net loss of $1.5 billion. Americans 2013 period net loss included net special operating charges of $251 million and total net special charges of $2.7 billion. Excluding the effects of these charges, American realized operating income of $1.8 billion and net income of $1.2 billion.  

In 2012, American realized operating income of $82 million and a net loss of $1.9 billion. Americans 2012 period net loss included net special operating charges of $386 million and total net special charges of $1.7 billion. Excluding the effects of these charges, American realized operating income of $468 million and a net loss of $210 million.  

The components of Americans net special charges included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are as follows (in millions):

     and retention, share-based compensation, divestiture of London Heathrow Slots, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training. In addition, American recorded a net charge of $60 million for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations, as well as $181 million in other special charges, including an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values, and other spare parts asset impairments, as well as $44 million in charges primarily relating to the buyout of certain aircraft leases. These charges were offset in part by a $305 million gain on the sale of Slots at DCA.  

In 2013, mainline operating special items, net included $166 million of primarily Merger related expenses due to the alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance and share-based compensation. In addition, American recorded a $107 million charge related to the pilot long-term disability obligation, a $43 million charge for workers compensation claims and a $33 million aircraft impairment charge. These charges were offset in part by a $67 million gain on the sale of Slots at LaGuardia Airport.  

In 2012, mainline operating special items, net consisted of $386 million of severance and related charges and write-off of leasehold improvements on aircraft and airport facilities that were rejected in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.  

 (3)  In 2014, nonoperating special items, net consisted principally of $43 million for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, $48 million of early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness and $29 million of non-cash interest accretion on bankruptcy settlement obligations. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of our cash held in Venezuelan bolivars.  

In 2013, nonoperating special items, net consisted of interest charges of $48 million to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan and penalty interest related to 10.5% secured notes and 7.50% senior secured notes, a $54 million charge related to the premium on tender for existing enhanced equipment trust certificates financings and the write-off of debt issuance costs and $19 million in charges related to the repayment of existing EETC financings.  

In 2012, nonoperating special items, net consisted of a $280 million benefit resulting from a settlement of a commercial dispute.  

 (4)  In 2013 and 2012, American recognized reorganization expenses as a result of the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. These amounts consisted primarily of estimated allowed claim amounts and professional fees.  

 (5)  In 2014, income tax special items, net were $342 million. During 2014, American sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, American recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $328 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), a subset of stockholders equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of Americans fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, American retained the $328 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated. In addition, American recorded a special $14 million non-cash deferred income tax provision related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.  

In 2013 and 2012, income tax special items, net included, respectively, a $538 million and a $569 million non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations. American is required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, American recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which was exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is  

85  

Table of Contents 

 equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, Americans year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The 2013 tax benefit was offset in part by a $214 million tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount American believes is more likely than not to be realized.  

Income Taxes  

At December 31, 2014, American had approximately $10.3 billion of gross NOL Carryforwards to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2015. American is a member of AAGs consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns. The amount of federal and state NOL Carryforwards available in those returns is $10.1 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, substantially all of which is expected to be available for use in 2015. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. These NOL Carryforwards include an unrealized tax benefit of $712 million related to the implementation of share-based compensation accounting guidance that will be recorded in equity when realized. American also had approximately $3.9 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2014, which will expire in years 2015 through 2034 if unused. Americans ability to deduct its NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 where an ownership change has occurred. American experienced an ownership change in connection with its emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. The general limitation rules of Section 382 for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. American elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permit approximately $9.5 billion of its federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the Section 382 annual limitation rules. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. Americans ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership change is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless another ownership change occurs.  

At December 31, 2014, American had an AMT credit carryforward of approximately $435 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period. Americans net deferred tax assets, which include the NOL Carryforwards, are subject to a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2014, the federal and state valuation allowances were $5.1 billion and $208 million, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, utilization of the NOL Carryforwards after December 9, 2013 will result in a corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance and offset Americans tax provision dollar for dollar.  

American provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (primarily reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. In making this determination, American considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions. American considers many factors in evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets including risks associated with merger integration as well as other factors, which continue to be affected by conditions beyond Americans control, such as the condition of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand. American has concluded as of December 31, 2014 that the valuation allowance was still needed on its deferred tax asset based on the weight of the factors described above.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, American recorded a $319 million tax provision. This provision included $342 million of special tax charges as described above. In addition, American recorded $6 million of tax expense principally related to certain states and countries where NOL Carryforwards were limited or unavailable to be used. These charges were offset in part by a $29 million federal income tax benefit resulting from our elections under applicable sections of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014), allowing corporations to accelerate utilization of certain research and AMT credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, American recorded a $354 million tax benefit. This benefit included $324 million of net special tax benefits as described above. In addition, American recorded a $30 million federal income tax benefit under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 as described above.  

For the year ended December 31, 2012, American recorded a $569 million special tax benefit as described above.

The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on Americans consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  In exchange for employees contributions to the successful reorganization, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, American agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim, which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion.  

 (2)  Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing or facility agreement when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify

     such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note 2 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.  

 (3)  Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, American recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of $180 million, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK, and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.  

 (4)  The Plan allowed unsecured creditors receiving AAG Series A Preferred Stock a conversion discount of 3.5%. Accordingly, American recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.  

2013 Compared to 2012  

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating revenues in 2013 were $25.8 billion as compared to $24.8 billion in 2012, an increase of $935 million or 3.8%, which was driven by strong demand for air travel. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:  

       Mainline passenger revenues increased 4.5% to $19.6 billion in 2013 as compared to $18.7 billion in 2012 due to an increase in ASMs and yield.  

       Regional passenger revenues were $2.9 billion, which was relatively flat as compared to 2012 due to an increase in ASMs, offset by a decrease in yield.  

       Other revenues were $2.6 billion in 2013, an increase of $70 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to increased revenues associated with the sale of AAdvantage frequent flyer mileage credits and a $31 million special credit related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of Americans AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses in 2013 were $24.2 billion as compared to $24.7 billion in 2012, a decrease of $517 million or 2.1%. Significant changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows:  

       Salaries, wages and benefits decreased $941 million, or 15.2%, due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan, as well as effects related to the freezing of Americans pension plan in 2012.  

       Aircraft rent increased $189 million, or 34.2%, as a result of new aircraft deliveries in 2013 as American continued its fleet renewal program.  

       Selling expenses increased $69 million, or 6.5%, as a result of higher commissions and credit card fees related to the increase in passenger revenues.  

       Other operating expenses increased $239 million, or 8.9%, due to higher costs associated with outsourced services and enhanced customer product offerings.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses increased $25 million, or 0.8%, in 2013 to $3.1 billion from $3.0 billion in 2012. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a $43 million, or 4.2%, increase in fuel costs driven by higher fuel consumption due to the transition from turboprop to regional jet aircraft.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

91  

Table of Contents 

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased $64 million, or 9.8%, to $710 million in 2013 from $646 million in 2012 primarily due to special charges of $92 million to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan and penalty interest related to 10.5% secured notes and 7.50% senior secured notes.  

Other nonoperating expense, net of $84 million in 2013 consists principally of net foreign currency losses of $55 million and early debt extinguishment charges of $48 million. Other nonoperating income in 2012 consisted principally of a $280 million special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute partially offset by net foreign currency losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash  

As of December 31, 2014, AAGs total cash, short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments was $8.1 billion, of which $774 million was restricted. Additional detail is provided in the table below (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Our restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers compensation obligations.  

As of December 31, 2014, $804 million of our cash and short-term investments balances were held in foreign bank accounts, of which approximately $656 million was held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance includes approximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars and approximately $35 million valued at 12.0 bolivars, with the rate depending on the date we submitted our repatriation request to the Venezuelan government. These rates are materially more favorable than the exchange rates currently prevailing for other transactions conducted outside of the Venezuelan governments currency exchange system that we participate in. Our cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars decreased $54 million from the December 31, 2013 balance of $710 million primarily due to $88 million in cash repatriations and $30 million in foreign currency losses as described below, partially offset by additional cash proceeds from ticket sales in early 2014. In the second and third quarters of 2014, we repatriated $65 million including $31 million valued at 6.3 bolivars to the dollar and $34 million valued at 10.6 bolivars to the dollar. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we incurred an $11 million foreign currency loss related to the receipt of $23 million at a rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar for one of our 2012 repatriation requests originally valued at a rate of 4.3 bolivars to the dollar. Accordingly, we revalued our remaining pending 2012 repatriation requests from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the dollar resulting in additional foreign currency losses of $19 million. In total, we recognized a $30 million special charge for these foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. During 2014, we significantly reduced capacity in this market and we are no longer accepting bolivars as payment for airline tickets. We are continuing to work with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. We are monitoring this situation closely and continue to evaluate our holdings of Venezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses, which could be material, particularly in light of the uncertainty posed by the new foreign exchange regulations announced in mid-February 2015 and the continued deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.  

Share Repurchase Programs  

In July 2014, as part of a capital deployment program, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program which was completed in December 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased 23.4 million shares of AAG Common Stock for $1.0 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $42.72.  

93  

Table of Contents 

On January 27, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016. Shares repurchased under the program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.  

Separate from our share repurchase programs, during 2014, we also withheld approximately 9 million shares of AAG Common Stock and paid approximately $325 million in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with distributions under the Plan and employee equity awards.  

Cash Dividends Paid  

In July 2014, as part of our capital deployment program, our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend for shareholders of record as of August 4, 2014, and payable on August 18, 2014.  

In October 2014, our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share dividend for shareholders of record on November 3, 2014, and payable on November 17, 2014.  

In January 2015, our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share dividend for shareholders of record on February 9, 2015, and payable on February 23, 2015.  

The total cash payment for dividends during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $144 million.  

Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time under our capital deployment program will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our capital deployment program does not obligate us to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion.  

Sources and Uses of Cash  

AAG  

2014 Compared to 2013  

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion and $675 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, a period-over-period increase of $2.4 billion. This period-over-period improvement in cash flow generated from operating activities is principally due to increased profitability and the inclusion of a full year of US Airways Groups net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases were offset in part by higher pension contributions made during 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we contributed $810 million and $494 million, respectively, to fund our defined benefit pension plans, representing a $316 million period-over-period increase in contributions.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

Principal investing activities in the 2014 period included expenditures of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of newly delivered aircraft including 20 Boeing 737 family aircraft, six Boeing 777 aircraft, 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 family aircraft and 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased including three Airbus A330 family

 aircraft, three Boeing 777 aircraft and nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA Slots and a $261 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to projected workers compensation obligations.  

Principal investing activities in 2013 included expenditures of $3.1 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 31 Boeing 737 aircraft and eight Boeing 777 aircraft as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order and $1.2 billion in net purchases of short-term investments. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of certain property and equipment and a $147 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to projected workers compensation obligations. Additionally, in connection with the Merger, we acquired the $206 million cash balance of US Airways Group.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash used in financing activities was $315 million in 2014 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $3.8 billion in 2013.  

Principal financing activities in the 2014 period included $1.0 billion in stock repurchases and debt repayments of $3.1 billion, including the $1.0 billion prepayment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes, the $175 million cash settlement of US Airways Groups 7.25% convertible notes, the $155 million prepayment of outstanding debt secured by certain aircraft and the $366 million prepayment of certain airport facility revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of $3.3 billion of debt, primarily including the $750 million term loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, the 5.50% senior notes, $1.8 billion of certain EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing 737 family aircraft.  

Principal financing activities in 2013 included proceeds of $6.8 billion and consisted primarily of the issuance of debt of $5.1 billion, including the $1.9 billion 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $1.7 billion. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.9 billion.  

2013 Compared to 2012  

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $675 million and $1.3 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $610 million. This year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of US Airways Groups net cash used in operating activities of $327 million, for the post-Merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013, and our emergence from bankruptcy in 2013 which triggered cash payments for certain liabilities.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion and $1.6 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

Principal investing activities in 2013 included expenditures of $3.1 billion for property and equipment and consisted primarily of the purchases of 31 Boeing 737 aircraft and eight Boeing 777 aircraft and pre-delivery deposits for aircraft on order and $1.2 billion in net purchases of short-term investments. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of certain property and equipment and a $147 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additionally, in connection with the Merger, the Company acquired the $206 million cash balance of US Airways Group.

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion and $483 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

Principal financing activities in 2013 included proceeds of $6.8 billion and consisted primarily of the issuance of debt of $5.1 billion, including the $1.9 billion Term Loan Facility and proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $1.7 billion. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.9 billion.  

Principal financing activities in 2012 included proceeds of $1.8 billion and consisted primarily of $1.5 billion in proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. These proceeds were offset in part by debt repayments of $1.3 billion.

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion and $949 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, a period-over-period increase of $528 million. This period-over-period improvement in cash flow generated from operating activities is principally due to increased profitability offset in part by higher pension contributions made during 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, American contributed $809 million and $494 million, respectively, to fund its defined benefit pension plans, representing a $315 million period-over-period increase in contributions.

Commitments  

Significant Indebtedness  

As of December 31, 2014, AAG and American had $18.0 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, in long-term debt and capital leases (including current maturities and before debt discount). See Note 9 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 6 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on all indebtedness as of December 31, 2014. Our significant indebtedness includes the 2013 Credit Facilities, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facilities described below.  

2013 Credit Facilities  

On June 27, 2013, American and AAG entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, the 2013 Credit Agreement) with certain lenders. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility (the 2013 Term Loan Facility) that is scheduled to mature on June 27, 2019, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. As of December 31, 2014, $1.9 billion was outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan Facility.  

The 2013 Credit Agreement originally provided for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the 2013 Revolving Facility and, together with the 2013 Term Loan Facility, the 2013 Credit Facilities) scheduled to mature on June 27, 2018, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. The 2013 Term Loan Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the 2013 Term Loan Facility. The 2013 Revolving Facility provided that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have letters of credit issued thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of up to $1.0 billion. On October 10, 2014, American and AAG amended the 2013 Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the 2013 Revolving Facility to October 10, 2019 and increased the commitments thereunder to an aggregate amount of $1.4 billion while reducing the letter of credit commitments thereunder to $300 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  

The 2013 Credit Facilities bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at Americans option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%, with respect to the 2013 Term Loan Facility) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is 3.00% for borrowings under both the 2013 Term Loan Facility and the 2013 Revolving Facility.  

Upon consummation of the Merger, US Airways Group and US Airways joined the 2013 Credit Facilities as guarantors. Following the joinder, certain minimum dollar-thresholds under the negative and financial covenants in the 2013 Credit Facilities were automatically increased.  

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the 2013 Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including certain route authorities and certain take-off and landing rights and gate leaseholds at certain airports. American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the 2013 Credit Facilities as more fully described below in Collateral Related Covenants.  

The 2013 Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the 2013 Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a change of control (as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement) occurs, American will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the 2013 Credit Facilities and terminate the 2013 Revolving Facility. The 2013 Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the 2013 Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

2013 Citicorp Credit Facility  

On May 23, 2013, US Airways entered into a term loan credit facility (the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility) with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. US Airways Group and certain other subsidiaries of US Airways Group are guarantors of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement. In connection with the closing of the Merger, AAG and American entered into a joinder to the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility loan agreement pursuant to which AAG and American became guarantors under such agreement.  

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility consists of tranche B-1 term loans (Tranche B-1) and tranche B-2 term loans (Tranche B-2). As of December 31, 2014, $990 million was outstanding under Tranche B-1 and $594 million was outstanding under Tranche B-2. Voluntary prepayments may be made at any time, with a premium of 1.00% applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following January 16, 2014.  

As of December 31, 2014, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility bears interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at US Airways option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is 2.75% for Tranche B-1 and 2.25% for Tranche B-2.  

Tranche B-1 and Tranche B-2 mature on May 23, 2019 and November 23, 2016, respectively (unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties), and each is repayable in annual installments to be paid on each anniversary of the closing date in an amount equal to 1.00% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the loans with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the respective tranche.  

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the obligations of US Airways under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility are secured by liens on certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports, and certain other assets of US Airways. US Airways is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility as more fully described below in Collateral Related Covenants.  

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement contains events of default customary for similar financings, including a cross-default provision to certain other material indebtedness of US Airways and certain of its affiliates. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a change of control (as defined in the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement) occurs, US Airways will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay the outstanding loans in full together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment. The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, (a) require AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain unrestricted liquidity of not less than $2.0 billion, with not less than $750 million held in accounts subject to control agreements, and (b) restrict the ability of US Airways Group, its subsidiaries party to the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, AAG and American to make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain acquisitions, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into certain hedging transactions, and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.  

Senior Secured Notes  

In March 2014, American prepaid $100 million of its 7.50% senior secured notes at a redemption price of 103% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In July 2014, American prepaid the remaining outstanding principal balance of $900 million at a redemption price of 103.75% of outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the prepayment of the outstanding 7.50% senior secured notes, American paid $37 million of cash premiums and recorded a $5 million non-cash write off of unamortized deferred issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.

7.25% Convertible Notes  

In March 2014, we notified the holders of US Airways Groups 7.25% convertible notes that we had elected to settle solely in cash instead of shares of AAG Common Stock all conversions during the period beginning on March 15, 2014 and ending on, and including, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of May 15, 2014. In May 2014, we settled all outstanding 7.25% convertible notes in cash for approximately $175 million.  

Other Aircraft Financing Transactions  

In May 2014, we prepaid $113 million principal amount of outstanding debt secured by certain aircraft.  

During 2014, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $286 million in connection with financing certain aircraft deliveries. The notes mature in 2026 and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  

2013-1 EETCs  

During 2014, US Airways issued $559 million of equipment notes in two series under its 2013-1 EETCs completed in April 2013: Series A equipment notes in the amount of $423 million bearing interest at 3.95% per annum and Series B equipment notes in the amount of $136 million bearing interest at 5.375% per annum. As of December 31, 2014, the full $820 million of the escrowed proceeds from US Airways 2013-1 EETCs have been used to purchase Series A and Series B equipment notes issued by US Airways. The equipment notes are secured by liens on aircraft.  

2014-1 EETCs  

In September 2014, American created two pass-through trusts which issued approximately $957 million aggregate face amount of Series 2014-1 Class A and Class B EETCs in connection with the financing of 17 aircraft recently delivered to, and owned by, American (the 2014 EETC Aircraft).  

As of December 31, 2014, the full $957 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2014-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in two series: Series A equipment notes in the amount of $742 million bearing interest at 3.70% per annum and Series B equipment notes in the amount of $215 million bearing interest at 4.375% per annum. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are scheduled to be made in April and October of each year, beginning in April 2015. The final payments on the Series A and Series B equipment notes will be due in October 2026 and October 2022, respectively. The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2014 EETC Aircraft.  

Obligations Associated with Special Facility Revenue Bonds  

In 2014, we prepaid $314 million of obligations, of which $135 million was a reduction of debt on our balance sheet, associated with special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities to build or improve certain airport and maintenance facilities. The remaining portion of these obligations was accounted for as an operating lease.  

In addition, in August 2014, American elected to exercise its option to reset the interest rate on approximately $220 million aggregate principal amount of special facility revenue bonds reflected as debt on its balance sheet, related to the Los Angeles International Airport, resulting in the repurchase of these bonds by American in September 2014. American has the option to remarket these bonds in the future. In connection with the repurchase of these bonds, American paid $2 million in cash premiums and recorded a $5 million non-cash write off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs.  

100  

Table of Contents 

In December 2014, American purchased approximately $112 million aggregate principal amount of special facility revenue bonds related to the Tulsa International Airport, when such bonds were mandatorily tendered to American. Of this amount, $11 million was a reduction of debt on Americans balance sheet. American has the option to remarket these bonds in the future.  

5.50% Senior Notes  

In September 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2019 (the 5.50% senior notes). These notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1, beginning April 1, 2015. The 5.50% senior notes mature on October 1, 2019 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by American, US Airways Group and US Airways. The 5.50% senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of AAG. The indenture for the 5.50% senior notes contains covenants and events of default generally customary for similar financings. In addition, if we experience specific kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase the 5.50% senior notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the 5.50% senior notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.  

2014 Credit Facilities  

On October 10, 2014, American, AAG, US Airways Group and US Airways entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the 2014 Credit Agreement) with certain lenders. The 2014 Credit Agreement provides for a $750 million term loan facility (the 2014 Term Loan Facility) and a $400 million revolving credit facility (the 2014 Revolving Facility and, together with the 2014 Term Loan Facility, the 2014 Credit Facilities). As of December 31, 2014, $750 million was outstanding under the 2014 Term Loan Facility. The 2014 Revolving Facility provides that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder. American may have letters of credit issued under the 2014 Revolving Facility in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time up to $300 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2014 Revolving Facility.  

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the 2014 Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including certain route authorities and certain take-off and landing rights and gate leaseholds at certain airports. The obligations of American under the 2014 Credit Facilities are guaranteed by AAG, US Airways Group and US Airways. American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the 2014 Credit Facilities as more fully described below in Collateral Related Covenants.  

The 2014 Term Loan Facility and 2014 Revolving Facility mature on October 10, 2021 and October 10, 2019, respectively, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. The 2014 Term Loan Facility is repayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal balance with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan Facility. Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time, with a premium of 1.00% applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following October 10, 2014.  

The 2014 Credit Facilities bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at Americans option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75% in the case of the 2014 Term Loan Facility) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margins are 3.50% and 3.00% for borrowings under the 2014 Term Loan Facility and the 2014 Revolving Facility, respectively. If American has a corporate credit rating of Ba3 or higher from Moodys and BB- or higher from S&P, the applicable LIBOR margin is 3.25% under the 2014 Term Loan Facility.  

The 2014 Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the  

101  

Table of Contents 

 2014 Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a change of control (as defined in the 2014 Credit Agreement) occurs with respect to AAG, American will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the 2014 Credit Facilities and terminate the 2014 Revolving Facility. The 2014 Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the 2014 Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.  

AAdvantage Loan  

American had the right to repay in cash, without premium or penalty, any or all of the amounts owed to Citibank under the AAdvantage Loan. Effective January 2, 2015, American exercised its loan repayment right with respect to the full value of the outstanding balance to Citibank for $400 million. In connection with the repayment, in the first quarter of 2015, American will recognize an early debt extinguishment gain of approximately $17 million. The entire outstanding balance of the obligation is reflected in current maturities of long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.  

Guarantees  

In March 2014, AAG, US Airways Group and US Airways entered into amended and restated guarantees of the payment obligations of US Airways under the equipment notes relating to each of its Series 2010-1, 2011-1, 2012-1, 2012-2 and 2013-1 Pass Through Certificates, the result of which was to add AAG as a guarantor of such equipment notes on a joint and several basis with US Airways Group.  

Collateral Related Covenants  

Certain of our debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to periodically appraise the related collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, as described below.  

102  

Table of Contents 

Specifically, we are required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on a periodic basis on three Credit Facilities, as described below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  With respect to spare parts, one physical appraisal and one desktop appraisal are required in each fiscal year.  

At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the applicable collateral coverage tests as of the most recent measurement dates.  

Credit Ratings  

The following table details our credit ratings as of December 31, 2014:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *  The credit agency does not rate this category for this entity.  

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.

Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments  

As of December 31, 2014, we had definitive purchase agreements with Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers for the acquisition of the following mainline and regional aircraft:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  These aircraft may be operated by wholly-owned subsidiaries or leased to third-party regional carriers which would operate the aircraft under capacity purchase arrangements.  

We also had agreements for 55 spare engines to be delivered in 2015 and beyond. Under all of our aircraft and engine purchase agreements, our total future commitments as of December 31, 2014 are expected to be as follows (approximately, in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  These amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers and include all commitments for regional aircraft. American has granted Boeing a security interest in its purchase deposits with Boeing. Our purchase deposits totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014.  

In April 2014, we exercised our option to purchase, and terminated our existing lease financing arrangements with respect to, 62 Airbus A320 family aircraft scheduled to be delivered between the first quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2017. In connection with our exercise of such option, we also exercised our right to convert firm orders for 30 Airbus A320neo aircraft, scheduled to be delivered in 2021 and 2022, to options to acquire such aircraft. The table above reflects these changes.  

In December 2014, we exercised our right under our purchase agreement with Bombardier to convert 24 of our 40 option order CRJ900 aircraft to firm orders to acquire such aircraft.  

As of December 31, 2014, we did not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2017: 83 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 10 Airbus A320neo aircraft, six Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, 13 Boeing 737 family aircraft, three 737 MAX aircraft, four Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft, and 35 Boeing 787 family aircraft. In addition, we did not have financing commitments in place for aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.

Credit Card Processing Agreements  

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to us soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor may have liability if we do not ultimately provide the air travel. Our agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. Certain of our agreements provide that these holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the processing companies, up to the estimated liability for future air travel purchased with the respective credit cards, upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. The amount that the processing companies may withhold also varies as a result of changes in financial risk due to seasonal fluctuations in ticket volume. Additional holdback requirements will reduce our liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks.  

Pension Funding Obligation  

We are required to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Pension Relief Act of 2010 and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012. In 2014, we made our aggregate minimum required contributions for 2014 of $171 million, and made $639 million in supplemental contributions to our pension plans, above and beyond the $171 million of minimum required contributions.  

Based on our current funding assumptions, we have no minimum required contributions until 2019. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Upon expiration of these rules, our funding obligations are likely to increase materially. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of our investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and our actuarial experience.  

Labor Agreements  

In June 2014, we reached three agreements with IAM covering 11,000 US Airways mechanics, fleet service agents and maintenance training specialists. In July 2014, these three-year agreements that amend pre-merger contracts were ratified by IAM and will remain in effect until a joint collective bargaining agreement can be reached with their colleagues at the TWU to cover more than 30,000 employees at the new American Airlines.  

On December 18, 2014, we reached a JCBA with the APFA. On December 23, 2014, the APFA JCBA pay rates were increased by 4% due to a corporate wide initiative announced on that day. The new agreement did not require ratification and was effective immediately with the wage increases under the JCBA becoming effective January 1, 2015. We estimate that our total flight attendant costs in 2015 will be approximately $200 million higher as a result of this new agreement.  

On January 3, 2015, we reached a tentative agreement with the APA on a five-year JCBA, which was ratified on January 30, 2015. The new, higher pay rates were implemented retroactive to December 2, 2014. We estimate that the ratified contract will increase our 2015 cost of pilot compensation and benefits by approximately $650 million.  

In 2014, Envoy pilots ratified a new 10 year collective bargaining agreement, Piedmont pilots ratified a new 10 year collective bargaining agreement and Piedmont flight attendants ratified a new five-year collective bargaining agreement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 15 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 12 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  

Special Facility Revenue Bonds  

We guarantee the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which is leased to us. Under such leases, we are required to make rental payments through 2035, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest payments on the related bonds. As of December 31, 2014, the remaining lease payments guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $449 million, which are accounted for as operating leases.  

Pass-Through Trusts  

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with pass-through trust certificates, or EETCs, issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance our acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American and US Airways to raise the financing for several aircraft at one time and place such funds in escrow pending the purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American and US Airways.  

Each trust covered a set amount of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced within a specific period of time. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the funds in escrow to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes were issued, at American or US Airways election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leased the aircraft to American or US Airways. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG, American, US Airways Group or US Airways. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American or US Airways and, in certain instances, are guaranteed by AAG or US Airways Group as applicable. As of December 31, 2014, $7.0 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  

With respect to leveraged leases, American or US Airways evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American or US Airways concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American and US Airways generally are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the  

106  

Table of Contents 

 lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American or US Airways to absorb decreases in value or entitles American or US Airways to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American and US Airways do not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Americans existing lease arrangements do not contain fixed-price purchase options or similar features. Certain US Airways leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows it to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircrafts fair value at the option date. Under this feature, US Airways does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American and US Airways concluded they were not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American and US Airways account for their EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American and US Airways total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2014.  

AAG Contractual Obligations  

The following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Amounts represent contractual amounts due. For American, excludes $42 million and for US Airways Group, excludes $17 million of unamortized debt discount as of December 31, 2014.  

 (2)  For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at December 31, 2014.  

 (3)  For American, includes $4.3 billion of future principal payments and $1.1 billion of future interest payments, respectively, and for US Airways Group, includes $2.7 billion of future principal payments and  

107  

Table of Contents 

     $867 million of future interest payments, respectively, as of December 31, 2014, related to EETCs associated with mortgage financings for the purchase of certain aircraft.  

 (4)  See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information about the obligations of American and US Airways Group.  

 (5)  For American, includes $269 million and for US Airways Group, includes $1.8 billion of future minimum lease payments related to EETC leverage leased financings of certain aircraft as of December 31, 2014.  

 (6)  Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially.  

 (7)  Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and other postretirement benefit payments based on estimated payments through 2024. See Note 10 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions  

In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, the 2013 Credit Facilities, the 2014 Credit Facilities, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and certain of our other financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements.  

In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.

Basis of Presentation  

See Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results  

108  

Table of Contents 

 could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.  

Passenger revenue  

Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. AAGs air traffic liability was $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and Americans air traffic liability was $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel was to be provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in results of operations during the period in which the evaluations are completed.  

Long-lived Assets  

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment along with other fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets such as certain domestic take-off and landing rights, customer relationships, marketing agreements and tradenames. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Amortizing intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.  

We record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect managements best estimate of future market and operating conditions, including our current fleet plan and considerations of any modifications thereto. Estimates of fair value represent managements best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.  

The majority of Americans and US Airways fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.

Table of Contents 

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets  

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate. We have one consolidated reporting unit.  

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain international and domestic take-off and landing rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate.  

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative screen. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.  

If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under the quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the following assumptions: (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates depending on the asset (4) a tax rate and (5) market prices for comparable assets. These assumptions are consistent with those which hypothetical market participants would use. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach, we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value.  

Based upon our annual testing, there were no impairments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in 2014.  

Business Combination Measurements  

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we estimated the fair value of US Airways assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the Merger, December 9, 2013. These fair value adjustments did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us in the Merger.  

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income and cost approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, other than certain long-term debt assumed in the Merger. The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized to estimate the fair value of US Airways aircraft and operating leases. The market approach used includes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets, as well as pricing guides and other sources. We considered the current market for the aircraft, the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets, among other factors. We also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take-off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets, including customer relationships, marketing agreements, certain international route authorities, and the US Airways tradename. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The fair value of the Dividend Miles frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles which were expected to be redeemed at December 9, 2013. The weighted average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel.

Frequent flyer programs  

AAG currently operates two frequent traveler programs, Americans AAdvantage and US Airways Dividend Miles. These programs award mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, US Airways and oneworld carriers, as well as certain other partner airlines that participate in the programs. Mileage credits can also be earned through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in our respective loyalty programs. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American, US Airways or other participating partner airlines, in which case we pay a fee.  

We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members earn mileage credits by flying on American, US Airways or our regional affiliates. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.  

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level required to redeem an award. Additionally, outstanding mileage credits are subject to expiration if unused. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These estimates are based on historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the statement of operations as a part of passenger revenue.  

The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. Incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food, and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. No profit or overhead margin is included in the accrual of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon our 12-month historical average of such costs.  

We applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger and therefore recorded the liability for outstanding US Airways mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. As of December 31, 2014, the liability for outstanding mileage credits expected to be redeemed for future travel awards for US Airways under the Dividend Miles program was $638 million and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within frequent flyer liability. This liability will be reduced as miles are redeemed and new miles earned will be recorded as a liability based on the incremental cost method discussed above.  

As of December 31, 2014, the liability for outstanding mileage credits for the AAdvantage program was $647 million and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within frequent flyer liability.  

American and US Airways also sell frequent flyer program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. Historically, we have used the residual method of accounting to determine the values of each component as there had not been a material modification to any significant agreements since our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements on January 1, 2011.  

During the fourth quarter of 2013, American and Citibank amended their current agreement which resulted in a material modification of the terms of the arrangement. Also, in connection with our acquisition of US Airways on December 9, 2013, a material modification occurred on all of US Airways agreements in connection with the Merger. Therefore, subsequent to the amendments of these arrangements, we will apply the relative selling price method to determine the values of each deliverable. Under the relative selling price approach, we identified five revenue elements for the co-branded credit card agreements with Citibank and Barclays: the transportation component; use of the

 American and US Airways brand including access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; lounge access; and baggage services (together excluding the transportation component, the marketing component).  

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.  

The marketing component represents services provided to our business partners and relates primarily to the use of Americans and US Airways logo and tradenames along with access to customers lists of AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. The marketing services are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale.  

Upon application of the relative selling price method in 2013 for Americans Citibank modification, we reduced our travel component liability and recorded other revenue of approximately $31 million. As a result of the change in the marketing component value when the relative selling price method is applied, American and US Airways now defer less revenue per mile sold.  

For Americans agreements where there has not been a material modification, we continue to apply the residual method.  

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, AAG had $1.5 billion in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded as frequent flyer liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, AAGs marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately $1.4 billion, $834 million and $725 million, respectively.  

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, American had $1.2 billion, in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded as frequent flyer liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Americans marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately $1.1 billion, $816 million and $725 million, respectively.  

A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the liability. A 1% increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have a $31 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2014. A 10% increase or decrease in the assumed price per gallon of fuel would have a $23 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2014.  

A change to the estimated fair value of the transportation component could have a significant impact on revenue. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the transportation component would have an approximately $91 million impact on revenue recognized in 2014.  

The number of one way travel award redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2014, was approximately 7.9 million representing approximately 5.5% of our total mainline and regional RPMs during that period. We believe displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given our load factors and our ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory.  

Pensions and retiree medical and other benefits  

We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and (iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2014 would increase our pension and postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.4 billion and $58 million, respectively, and increase estimated 2015 pension expense by $7 million and decrease estimated 2015 postretirement benefit expense by $2 million.  

 (2)  The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 32% longer duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds, 33% U.S. value stocks, 18% developed international stocks, 9% emerging markets stocks and bonds and 8% alternative (private) investments. The expected return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. We monitor our actual asset allocation and believe that our long-term asset allocation will continue to approximate our target allocation. Our historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets, calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is approximately 8% as of December 31, 2014. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2014 would increase estimated 2015 pension expense and postretirement benefit expense by approximately $53 million and $1 million, respectively.  

 (3)  The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2015 postretirement benefits expense by $3 million.  

During 2014, we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect our experience and future expectations. This resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of our pension and retiree medical programs of $682 million and $47 million, respectively. We also reviewed and revised certain other economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical discount rates and health care cost and trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension and retiree medical plans resulted in an increase of $1.8 billion and a decrease of $64 million, respectively, in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 primarily due to the decrease in the pension discount rate.

Income taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  

New Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2014-09 applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not permitted and entities have the choice to apply ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-09 at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-09 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.
