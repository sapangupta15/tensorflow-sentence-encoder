ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview  

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, UAL or the Company) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, United). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. Uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UALs revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UALs assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the Company in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.  

On May 2, 2010, UAL Corporation, Continental Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Continental) and JT Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAL Corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger. On October 1, 2010, JT Merger Sub Inc. merged with and into Continental, with Continental surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAL Corporation (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger, UAL Corporation became the parent company of both United Air Lines, Inc. and Continental and UAL Corporations name was changed to United Continental Holdings, Inc. On March 31, 2013, the Company merged United Air Lines, Inc. into Continental to form one legal entity, and Continentals name was changed to United Airlines, Inc. The financial statements of United Air Lines, Inc. and Continental are now combined at their historical cost for all periods presented beginning on October 1, 2010, the date on which Continental became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAL.  

2013 Financial Highlights  

       The Company recorded net income of $571 million for 2013, as compared to net loss of $723 million for 2012. Excluding special charges, the Company recorded net income of $1.1 billion for 2013, compared to net income of $589 million for 2012. See Part II, Item 6 of this report for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income.  

       Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2013 was $5.1 billion as compared to $6.5 billion at December 31, 2012.  

       2013 consolidated passenger revenue increased approximately $539 million, or 1.7%, as compared to 2012. Consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) increased 3.1% in 2013 compared to 2012.  

       Full-year 2013 cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 1.2% year-over-year.  

2013 Operational Highlights  

       For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded a U.S. Department of Transportation on-time arrival rate of 79.3% and 77.4%, respectively, and a system completion factor of 99.0% and 98.6%, respectively.  

       Consolidated traffic (RPMs) for 2013 decreased 0.2% as compared to 2012, while consolidated capacity (ASMs) decreased 1.4% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 83.6% in 2013 versus a consolidated load factor of 82.6% in 2012.  

       The Company took delivery of two new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners in 2013, bringing its total Dreamliner fleet to eight aircraft. The Company also took delivery of 24 new Boeing 737-900ERs in 2013. United exited from scheduled service 23 Boeing 757-200s and the last of its Boeing 737-500s and Boeing 767-200s.

2014 Outlook  

Set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. See Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report and the factors described under Forward-Looking Information for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.  

The Company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2014. Key initiatives for the year include improving customer experience by adding satellite-based Wi-Fi on more than 300 additional mainline aircraft, introducing a new united.com website, refurbishing aircraft interiors, investing in our airports and taking delivery of more than 50 new, highly-efficient and customer-pleasing aircraft.  

Economic Conditions. The economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2014 is characterized by expected slow or modest U.S. and global economic growth. In such conditions, we expect a modest increase in the demand for air travel. Continuing economic uncertainty, including uncertainty in the strength of key Asian markets, such as China, and continued political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the Middle East, may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to achieve sufficient profitability in 2014.  

Capacity. Over the past three years, the Company leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match capacity with market demand. In 2014, the Company expects consolidated ASMs to grow between 1% and 2% year-over-year. The Company announced that it is expanding its worldwide route network in 2014 by launching nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, China (the fourth-largest city in China) and Taipei, Taiwan, and from Chicago to Edinburgh, Scotland, and new routes from its hubs to international destinations such as Houston to Munich and Washington Dulles to Madrid. Should fuel prices increase significantly or should the U.S. or global economic growth outlook decline substantially, we would likely adjust our capacity plans to reflect the different operating environment.  

In February of 2014 the Company announced that it would be reducing its flying from Cleveland in stages beginning in April. The Company will reduce its average daily departures from Cleveland by around 60 percent. The decision to reduce flying was driven by continued losses in Cleveland, and the timing of the flight reductions was accelerated by industry-wide effects of new federal regulations that impact the Company and its regional partner flying. These new regulations impact the Company and its regional partner flying, as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots, while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire. Although this is an industry issue, it directly affects the Company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying, as several regional partners are beginning to have difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced new pilot availability. As a result, we will be reducing our average daily departures from Cleveland by approximately 60%. We expect to be able to keep almost all mainline departures (reducing only one of our 26 peak day mainline departures), but will need to reduce regional departures from Cleveland by over 70%. We will make these reductions in roughly one-third increments in each of early April, May and June 2014. When the schedule reductions are fully implemented in June, we plan to offer 72 peak-day flights from Cleveland, and serve 20 destinations from Cleveland on a non-stop basis. We currently expect to reduce up to 470 airport operations and catering positions in Cleveland. Those reductions will likely begin in June. The Company expects to record a special charge in 2014 related to the reduction in force and other contractual commitments at Cleveland. The Company is not currently able to estimate the amount of these charges or the time period in which they will be recorded, but such amounts could be significant.  

Fuel. The Companys average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $3.13 in 2013 as compared to $3.27 in 2012. If fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels, we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs. In addition, high fuel prices may impair our ability to achieve profitability. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2014, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Companys annual fuel expense by approximately $94 million. To protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel, the Company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements.

Labor. As of December 31, 2013, United had approximately 80% of employees represented by unions. During 2013, the Company accepted an integrated seniority list for its pilots from the Air Line Pilots Association, International. The Company also announced that the fleet service, passenger service and storekeeper work groups at its United, CMI and MileagePlus subsidiaries ratified new joint labor agreements. We are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our remaining employee groups without joint collective bargaining agreements, including our technicians, flight attendants and dispatchers. The Company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups, although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have a material financial impact on the Company.  

CASM. In 2014, the Company expects CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense, profit sharing and special charges to increase 1% to 2% year-over-year.  

The Company has begun a project to reduce its annual costs by $2 billion and generate an incremental $700 million in additional ancillary revenue by the end of 2017. The savings are comprised of $1 billion in annual fuel savings and $1 billion of non-fuel savings.  

Results of Operations  

In this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012, and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor the Companys performance on a consistent basis.

The table below presents the Companys passenger revenues and operating data based on geographic region (regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) See Part II, Item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.  

Consolidated passenger revenue in 2013 increased $539 million, or 1.7%, as compared to 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 1.8% and an increase in average fare per passenger of 2.6%, offset in part by a decline in capacity of 1.4% and a reduction in traffic of 0.2% as compared to the year-ago period. Consolidated passenger revenue was also impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in China and the Japanese yen weakening against the U.S. dollar, resulting in lower Pacific yields and a revenue management demand forecast which underestimated the amount of close-in booking demand resulting in a lower-than-expected yield mix.  

Cargo revenue decreased by $136 million, or 13.4%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to lower volumes on freight primarily in the Domestic and Atlantic regions offset slightly by an increase in mail revenue for the period. Both freight volume and yield continued to decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the continuation of declining demand for shipments of freight.  

Other operating revenue increased $724 million, or 20.4%, in 2013 as compared to 2012, which was primarily due to the sale of aircraft fuel of approximately $400 million to a third party. Other operating revenue also increased due to additional revenue from non-airline partners under our MileagePlus loyalty program, passenger ticket change fees and sales of airport lounge access.

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to the Companys operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The significant decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices, a 1.4% reduction in capacity and gains (losses) from fuel hedging activity in both years, as shown in the table below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Includes ineffectiveness gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges and gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges that were not designated for hedge accounting. These amounts are recorded in Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net.  

(b) This figure does not include non-cash mark-to-market (NCMTM) gains, which the Company records in Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net. NCMTM gains were $45 million and $38 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

Salaries and related costs increased $680 million, or 8.6%, in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase was due to higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements, profit sharing and other incentive programs, as well as increased pension and retirement plan costs. For 2014, pensions and other postretirement benefits expense is expected to decrease due to significant plan changes, but will be offset by higher wage rates from new collective bargaining agreements.  

Landing fees and other rent increased $161 million, or 8.3%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly. Landing fees paid directly to airports are charged to Landing fees and other rent while payments to regional carriers are recorded to Regional

 capacity purchase. As a result of this change, there has been a significant shift of expense out of Regional capacity purchase into Landing fees and other rent in 2013. Other rent also increased as a result of the increase in rent at Newark Liberty pursuant to an amendment to Uniteds Terminal C lease signed in early 2013 that extended the term of the Terminal C lease with respect to concourses C-1 and C-2 at Newark Liberty until 2033.  

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $61 million, or 3.5%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased volume and scope of airframe heavy checks, mainly on the Boeing 747 and Boeing 757 fleet types, partially offset by a reduction in engine maintenance volumes driven mainly by the timing of overhauls.  

Depreciation and amortization increased $167 million, or 11.0%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to additions in owned property and equipment in the current year, specifically related to new aircraft and improvements at airport facilities, as well as accelerated depreciation of $89 million on 30 Boeing 757-200 aircraft in process of being sold to a third party.  

Other operating expenses increased $514 million, or 11.0%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the cost of aircraft fuel sold to a third party and an increase in other personnel-related expenses.  

The table below presents integration-related costs and special items incurred by the Company during the years ended December 31 (in millions):

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Companys nonoperating income (expense) (in millions except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $52 million, or 6.2%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower average debt principal outstanding for a majority of the year.  

36  

Table of Contents 

In 2013, miscellaneous, net included a gain of $84 million from fuel hedge derivatives as compared to a gain of $37 million in 2012.  

Uniteds nonoperating expense also included a net gain of $70 million associated with marking to market the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities related to agreements that provide for Uniteds convertible debt to be settled with UAL common stock as compared to a net gain of $42 million in 2012. This net gain and related derivatives are reflected only in the United stand-alone financial statements as they are eliminated at the consolidated level. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Table of Contents 

Consolidated passenger revenue in 2012 increased approximately $72 million, or 0.2%, as compared to 2011. This increase was due to an increase of 1.2% in both average fare per passenger and yield, over the same period as a result of improved pricing primarily from industry capacity discipline, offset by a 1.0% decline in passengers. The reduced traffic from both business and leisure passengers in 2012 was offset by higher fares, which drove improvements in both average fare per passenger and yield.  

Cargo revenue decreased by $149 million, or 12.8%, in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to excess industry capacity and a weaker demand environment. Both cargo volume and yield declined in 2012 compared to 2011. Freight revenue in 2012 decreased 13.4% compared to 2011 due to lower volume, fuel surcharges and processing fees. Mail revenue decreased 8.1% in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to lower volume.  

The Company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by $107 million in connection with a modification to The Consolidated Amended and Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement (the Co-Brand Agreement) with Chase Bank USA, N.A. (Chase). See Note 17 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.  

Other operating revenue was up $226 million, or 6.8%, in 2012 as compared to 2011, which was primarily due to a change in the deferral rate related to the sales of credit card miles in conjunction with the modification of the Co-Brand Agreement in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, which was adopted in 2011. Other operating revenue also increased due to additional sales of aircraft fuel to a third party.

The significant increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased fuel prices and gains (losses) from fuel hedging activity in both years, as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for 2012 as compared to 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Includes ineffectiveness gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges and gains (losses) on cash-settled hedges that were not designated for hedge accounting. These amounts are recorded in Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net.  

(b) This figure does not include NCMTM gains (losses), which the Company records in Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net. NCMTM gains (losses) were $38 million and $(3) million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

Salaries and related costs increased $293 million, or 3.8%, in 2012 as compared to 2011. The increase was due to several factors including a 3.5% increase in the number of average full-time employees year-over-year, higher pay rates primarily driven by new collective bargaining agreements, pension costs, and overtime for airport and call center employees related to our conversion to a single passenger service system. The increase was offset by a decrease in profit sharing and lower workers compensation and long-term disability.  

Distribution expenses decreased $83 million, or 5.8%, in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to reduced fees with our online ticket agents, lower credit card discount fees driven by legislation reducing costs on debit card sales, and lower volume of global distribution fees paid.  

Other operating expenses increased $78 million, or 1.7%, in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to additional trip interruption costs, costs associated with higher fuel sales, hotel and per diem expenses, personnel-related expenses and higher advertising expenses.

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $114 million, or 12%, in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower average debt principal outstanding for a majority of the year.  

In 2012, miscellaneous, net included a fuel hedge ineffectiveness loss of $1 million primarily resulting from a decrease in fuel hedge ineffectiveness as compared to a loss of $59 million in the year-ago period. Miscellaneous, net also included mark-to-market gains of $38 million from derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting as compared to zero in 2011.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $5.1 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of $1.4 billion from December 31, 2012. The Company had its entire commitment capacity of $1.0 billion under the Credit Agreement available for letters of credit or borrowings as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $395 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for performance bonds, letters of credit, credit card processing agreements and estimated future workers compensation claims. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations that are not currently backed by cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 totaled $447 million. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had cash collateralized $61 million of letters of credit. Approximately $80 million of the Companys unrestricted

 cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars as of December 31, 2013, valued at the weighted average applicable exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. On January 24, 2014, the Venezuelan government announced that a newly-implemented system will determine the exchange rate (currently 11.36 to the U.S. dollar) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of repatriation of local currency. United is working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency.  

As is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital. We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. At December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $12.4 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.5 billion that are due within the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial non-cancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. The Company had principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling $2.3 billion in 2013.  

The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase its debt in open market transactions to reduce its indebtedness and the amount of interest paid on its indebtedness.  

For 2014, the Company expects between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion dollars of gross capital expenditures. See Notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information on commitments.  

As of December 31, 2013, a substantial portion of the Companys assets, principally aircraft, spare engines, aircraft spare parts, route authorities and certain other intangible assets, were pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 11 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.  

Although access to the capital markets improved in recent years as evidenced by our financing transactions, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines.  

The following is a discussion of the Companys sources and uses of cash from 2011 through 2013.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

2013 compared to 2012  

The Companys cash from operating activities increased by $509 million in 2013, as compared to 2012. Cash from operations increased primarily due to the Companys improvement in earnings in 2013.  

2012 compared to 2011  

The Companys cash from operating activities decreased by $1.5 billion in 2012, as compared to 2011. Cash from operations declined due to the Companys net loss position and the reduction of frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles by $712 million in 2012.  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

2013 compared to 2012  

The Companys capital expenditures were $2.2 billion and $2 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Companys capital expenditures for 2013 were primarily attributable to the purchase of new Boeing aircraft and other fleet-related expenditures to improve the onboard experience of our existing aircraft.  

41  

Table of Contents 

2012 compared to 2011  

The Companys capital expenditures were $2 billion and $840 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Companys capital expenditures for 2012 were primarily attributable to the purchase of new Boeing aircraft and other fleet-related expenditures to improve the onboard experience of our existing aircraft.  

The Company increased its short-term investments, net of proceeds, by $245 million in 2012 in order to improve interest income.  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

Significant financing events in 2013 were as follows:  

       On February 1, 2013, United redeemed all of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 and $200 million aggregate principal amount of 12.0% Senior Second Lien Notes due 2013. On February 8, 2013, United redeemed all $123 million aggregate principal amount of the B tranche of the 2006-1 enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) equipment notes due 2013. On April 1, 2013, United redeemed all of the $180 million aggregate principal amount of the senior tranche of the 2006-1 EETC equipment notes due 2013.  

       On March 27, 2013, the Company used $900 million from the Credit Agreement, together with approximately $300 million of cash to retire the entire principal balance of a $1.2 billion term loan due 2014 that was outstanding under Uniteds Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2007 (the Amended Credit Facility). The Amended Credit Facility was terminated concurrently with the repayment of the term loan. The Company also terminated the $500 million revolving credit facility that it had previously entered into in December 2011. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  

       On March 27, 2013, United and UAL entered into the Credit Agreement as the borrower and guarantor, respectively. The Credit Agreement consists of a $900 million term loan due April 1, 2019 and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility available for drawing until April 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2013, United had its entire commitment capacity of $1.0 billion available under the revolving credit facility. The obligations of United under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on certain international route authorities between certain specified cities, certain take-off and landing rights and related assets of United.  

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 3.0% per annum, or another rate based on certain market interest rates, plus a margin of 2.0% per annum. The principal amount of the term loan must be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof, commencing on June 30, 2013, with any unpaid balance due on April 1, 2019. United may prepay all or a portion of the loan from time to time, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. United pays a commitment fee equal to 0.75% per annum on the undrawn amount available under the revolving credit facility. Certain covenants in the Credit Agreement and in the Companys indentures are summarized in Note 11 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.  

       In May 2013, UAL issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due June 1, 2018. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed and recorded by United on its balance sheet as debt.  

       In November 2013, UAL issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due December 1, 2020. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed and recorded by United on its balance sheet as debt.  

       UAL issued approximately 28 million shares of UAL common stock pursuant to agreements that UAL entered into with certain of its securityholders in exchange for approximately $240 million in aggregate principal amount of UALs outstanding 6% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 held by such securityholders. The Company retired the 6% Convertible Senior Notes acquired in the exchange. In  

42  

Table of Contents 

     February 2014, UAL issued 3,582,640 additional shares of UAL common stock pursuant to agreements that UAL entered into with certain of its securityholders of UALs 6% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 in exchange for $31,126,000 in aggregate principal amount.  

       In August 2013, December 2012 and October 2012, United created separate EETC pass-through trusts, each of which issued pass-through certificates. The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by United and secured by its aircraft. The Company records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of United. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of United. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until United issues equipment notes to the trust, which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by United and are not reported as debt on our consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not Uniteds assets. United has received all of the proceeds from the 2012 EETCs. United expects to receive all proceeds from the August 2013 pass-through trusts by the end of 2014. Certain details of the pass-through trusts are as follows (in millions, except interest rate):

Significant financing events in 2012 were as follows:  

     The Company received $1.5 billion in proceeds from EETC transactions in 2012;  

     During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company made debt and capital lease payments of $1.5 billion, including prepayments. These payments include $195 million related to Uniteds Series 2002-1 EETCs; and  

     In August 2012, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (the Authority) issued approximately $101 million of special facility revenue bonds (the 2012 Bonds) to provide funds for the defeasance of approximately $100 million of the Authoritys previously issued and outstanding special facility revenue bonds maturing on September 15, 2012 (the Refunded Bonds). The Refunded Bonds were guaranteed by United and payable from certain rental payments made by United pursuant to two lease agreements between the Authority and United. The 2012 Bonds are payable from certain loan repayments made by United under a loan agreement between United and the Authority. The 2012 Bonds are recorded by the Company as unsecured long-term debt.

Significant financing events in 2011 were as follows:  

     The Company entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, led by Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent. The facility was undrawn when it was replaced on March 27, 2013 with the Credit Agreement. The Company terminated its prior $255 million revolver under the Amended Credit Facility on December 21, 2011;  

     During 2011, the Company made debt and capital lease payments of $2.6 billion. These payments include $150 million related to the repurchase of UALs 5% Senior Convertible Notes and $570 million related to the repurchase of UALs 4.5% Senior Limited-Subordination Convertible Notes; and  

     The Company received $239 million in 2011 from its December 2010 pass-through trust financing. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of new aircraft and in the case of the currently owned aircraft, for general corporate purposes.  

For additional information regarding these matters, see Notes 3, 11, 13 and 16 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.  

Credit Ratings. As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* The credit agency does not issue corporate credit ratings for subsidiary entities.  

These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Below is a summary of additional liquidity matters. See the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Certain of the Companys financing agreements have covenants that impose certain operating and financial restrictions, as applicable, on the Company and its material subsidiaries.  

Contractual Obligations. The Companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.

Table of Contents 

The table below provides a summary of the Companys material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 (in billions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Long-term debt presented in the Companys financial statements is net of a $169 million debt discount which is being amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount. Contractual long-term debt includes $74 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a company that leases three aircraft from United. The creditors only recourse to United is repossession of the aircraft.  

 (b) Includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $88 million in 2014, $70 million in 2015, $64 million in 2016, $43 million in 2017, $35 million in 2018 and $279 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.  

 (c) Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our CPAs and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. Amounts also exclude a portion of Uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its CPAs. See Note 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.  

 (d) Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2023. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.  

 (e) Represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for Uniteds material plans. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies, below, for a discussion of our assumptions regarding Uniteds pension plans.  

 (f) Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft and spare engines only and noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services, primarily information technology support. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. The Companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in Contractual Obligations, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.  

As of December 31, 2013, United had cash collateralized $61 million of letters of credit. United also had $398 million of performance bonds and letters of credit relating to various real estate, customs and aircraft financing obligations at December 31, 2013. Most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the performance bonds have expiration dates through 2018.  

As of December 31, 2013, United is the guarantor of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing  

45  

Table of Contents 

 bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in the Companys financial statements. The leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. The annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above.  

EETCs. In August 2013, December 2012 and October 2012, United created separate EETC pass-through trusts, each of which issued pass-through certificates. The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by United and secured by its aircraft. The Company records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of United. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of United. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until United issues equipment notes to the trust, which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by United and are not reported as debt on our consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not Uniteds assets. United has received all of the proceeds from the 2012 EETCs. United expects to receive all proceeds from the August 2013 pass-through trusts by the end of 2014. Certain details of the pass-through trusts are as follows (in millions, except interest rate):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company evaluated whether the pass-through trusts formed are variable interest entities (VIEs) required to be consolidated by the Company under applicable accounting guidance, and determined that the pass-through trusts are VIEs. The Company determined that it does not have a variable interest in the pass-through trusts. The Company does not invest in or obtain a financial interest in the pass-through trusts. Rather, United has an obligation to make interest and principal payments on its equipment notes held by the pass-through trusts. The Company did not intend to have any voting or non-voting equity interest in the pass-through trusts or to absorb variability from the pass-through trusts. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that it is not required to consolidate the pass-through trusts.  

Increased Cost Provisions. In the Companys financing transactions that include loans, the Company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on LIBOR, for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $2.1 billion of floating rate debt and $286 million of fixed rate debt, with remaining terms of up to twelve years, that are subject to these increased cost provisions. In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-U.S. entities, with  

46  

Table of Contents 

 remaining terms of up to twelve years and an aggregate balance of $2.3 billion, we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.  

Fuel Consortia. United participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December 31, 2013, the Companys contingent exposure was approximately $250 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which range from 2014 to 2041. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.  

Passenger Revenue Recognition. The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. The Company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. When necessary, the Company records a reserve against our interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different. Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date.  

Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred. The fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Companys additional service to modify a previous sale. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets expire after one year.  

The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends.

Frequent Flyer Accounting. The Company has a frequent flyer program that is designed to increase customer loyalty. Program participants earn mileage credits (miles) by flying on United and certain other participating airlines. Program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in the Companys loyalty program. We sell miles to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. The Company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.  

In the case of the sale of air services, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. The Company determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. The total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis. The Companys estimated selling price of miles is based on the price we sell miles to Star Alliance partners in our reciprocal frequent flyer agreements as the best estimate of selling price for these miles.  

On December 9, 2013, US Airways and American Airlines closed their merger transaction and, as a result of the merger transaction, we anticipate US Airways will exit Star Alliance on March 30, 2014. Effective with the exit date of US Airways from Star Alliance, the Company will update its estimated selling price for miles to using the equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount, as the estimated selling price for miles. The equivalent ticket value used as the basis for the estimated selling price of miles is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class and geographic region. Management believes this change is a change in estimate, and as such, the change will be applied on a prospective basis. The estimated impact of this change on consolidated revenue is not expected to be material in 2014.  

United also has a significant contract to sell frequent flyer miles to its co-branded credit card partner, Chase. United identified five revenue elements in the Co-Brand Agreement: the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the United brand and access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; baggage services; and airport lounge usage (together, excluding the air transportation element, the marketing-related deliverables).  

The fair value of the elements is determined using managements estimated selling price of each element. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the Co-Brand Agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. The method for determining the selling price of the mile component is changing March 30, 2014, as described above. We also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis.  

The Company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. The Company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. The Companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs. Effective March 30, 2014, the Company will incorporate a fulfillment discount into its best estimate of selling price which incorporates the expected redemption of miles.  

The Company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered. The other elements are generally recognized as Other operating revenue when earned.

The following table summarizes information related to the Companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Long-Lived Assets. The net book value of operating property and equipment for the Company was $18 billion and $17.3 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.  

The Company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the Companys fleet plan and other relevant information. A one-year increase in the average depreciable life of the Companys flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $50 million.  

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. For purposes of this testing, the Company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment. An impairment charge is recognized when the assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value.  

Defined Benefit Plan Accounting. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets.  

Uniteds pension plans under-funded status was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2013. Funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. We estimate that our minimum funding requirements during 2014 are approximately $288 million. The fair value of the plans assets was $2.4 billion at December 31, 2013.  

When calculating pension expense for 2014, the Company assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.33%. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. Plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.  

49  

Table of Contents 

The defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. Return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity and hedge funds). Risk mitigating investments include primarily U.S. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. The allocation of assets was as follows at December 31, 2013:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points (from 7.33% to 6.83%) would increase estimated 2014 pension expense by approximately $12 million.  

Future pension obligations for Uniteds plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 5.09% at December 31, 2013. The Company selected the 2013 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2013 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments.  

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 5.09% to 4.59%) would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2013 by approximately $411 million and increase the estimated 2014 pension expense by approximately $49 million.  

Future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. All gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of $162 million and $826 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  

Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Accounting. Uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as Other Benefits. United also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and Medicare eligibility. Eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. Plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles, and other limits as described in the plans.  

The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. Other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. United has not been required to pre-fund its plan  

50  

Table of Contents 

 obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below. The Companys benefit obligation was $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. The Company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The Companys weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of December 31, 2013 was 4.94%, as compared to 4.12% for December 31, 2012. The health care cost trend rate assumed for 2013 was 6.75%, declining to 5% in 2020, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2014 of 7.25%, declining to 5.0% in 2020. A 1% increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the Companys total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2013 by $21 million; whereas, a 1% decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the Companys total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2013 by $17 million. A one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the Companys postretirement benefit liability by approximately $203 million and increase the estimated 2013 benefits expense by approximately $10 million.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans. Under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants and will reduce 2013 pension and retiree medical expense. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had unrecognized actuarial gains/(losses) for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $555 million and $(79) million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  

During 2013, the Company experienced significant changes in its benefit obligations related to its postretirement medical programs. The significant changes resulted from the reduction or elimination of benefits for certain work groups including elimination of the postretirement medical benefits for management and administrative employees and International Association of Machinists employees with less than 20 years of service. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2013 obligation. In addition, certain key actuarial changes resulted in an additional net reduction of the postretirement medical benefit obligations, principally market increases in discount rates, changes in participation and retirement rates for retiree medical plans (driven primarily by the actual experience in pilot retirement rates resulting from a change of the mandatory pilot retirement age to 65), partially offset by an increase in health care trend rates for postretirement medical plans. These changes in benefits that either qualified as curtailments (which reduced prior actuarial losses) or negative plan amendments are further described in Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to pension and postretirement plans. Actuarial assumption changes are reflected as a component of the net actuarial gains/(losses) during 2013.  

Income Taxes  

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible. The Companys management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. To form a conclusion, management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences, projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies, and negative evidence such as recent history of losses. Although the Company was not in a three-year cumulative loss position at the end of 2013, management determined that the loss in 2012, the overall modest level of cumulative pretax income in the three years ended December 31, 2013 of 0.6% of total revenues in that period  

51  

Table of Contents 

 and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still necessary. Management will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowance.  

Forward-Looking Information  

Certain statements throughout Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report are forward-looking and thus reflect the Companys current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are and will be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to the Companys operations and business environment that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Words such as expects, will, plans, anticipates, indicates, believes, forecast, guidance, outlook and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  

Additionally, forward-looking statements include statements which do not relate solely to historical facts, such as statements which identify uncertainties or trends, discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.  

The Companys actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: its ability to comply with the terms of its various financing arrangements; the costs and availability of financing; its ability to maintain adequate liquidity; its ability to execute its operational plans, including optimizing its revenue; its ability to control its costs, including realizing benefits from its resource optimization efforts, cost reduction initiatives and fleet replacement programs; its ability to utilize its net operating losses; its ability to attract and retain customers; demand for transportation in the markets in which it operates; an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior; demand for travel and the impact that global economic conditions have on customer travel patterns; excessive taxation and the inability to offset future taxable income; general economic conditions (including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, investment or credit market conditions, crude oil prices, costs of aircraft fuel and energy refining capacity in relevant markets); its ability to cost-effectively hedge against increases in the price of aircraft fuel; any potential realized or unrealized gains or losses related to fuel or currency hedging programs; the effects of any hostilities, act of war or terrorist attack; the ability of other air carriers with whom the Company has alliances or partnerships to provide the services contemplated by the respective arrangements with such carriers; the costs and availability of aviation and other insurance; industry consolidation or changes in airline alliances; competitive pressures on pricing and demand; its capacity decisions and the capacity decisions of its competitors; U.S. or foreign governmental legislation, regulation and other actions (including open skies agreements and environmental regulations); labor costs; its ability to maintain satisfactory labor relations and the results of the collective bargaining agreement process with its union groups; any disruptions to operations due to any potential actions by its labor groups; weather conditions; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports the Company files with the SEC.
