EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro or the Company) is a branded-play company dedicated to fulfilling the fundamental need for play for children and families through creative expression of the Companys world class brand portfolio. From toys and games, to television programming, motion pictures, digital gaming and a comprehensive licensing program, Hasbro applies its brand blueprint to its broad portfolio of properties. The brand blueprint revolves around the objectives of continuously re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting the Companys existing brands, imagining, inventing and igniting new brands, and offering consumers the ability to experience the Companys brands in all areas of their lives.  

To accomplish these objectives, the Company offers consumers the ability to experience its branded play through innovative toys and games, digital media, lifestyle licensing and publishing and entertainment, including television programming and motion pictures. The Companys focus remains on growing owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products and brands which respond to market insights, offering entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the Companys brands across multiple forms and formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to increase operating margins and maintain a strong balance sheet.  

The Company earns revenue and generates cash primarily through the sale of a broad variety of toy and game products and distribution of television programming based on the Companys properties, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with complementary products, including digital media and games and lifestyle products, offered by third parties, or in certain situations, toy products where the Company considers the out-licensing of brands to be more effective. The Companys brand architecture includes franchise brands, key partner brands, challenger brands, gaming mega brands and new brands. The Companys franchise and challenger brands represent Company-owned brands or brands which if not entirely owned, are broadly controlled by the Company, and which have been successful over the long term. Franchise brands are the Companys most significant owned or controlled brands which it believes have the ability to deliver significant revenue over the long-term. Challenger brands are brands which have not yet achieved franchise brand status, but have the potential to do so with investment and time. The Companys franchise brands are LITTLEST PET SHOP, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, MY LITTLE PONY, NERF, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, while challenger brands include BABY ALIVE, FURBY, FURREAL FRIENDS, and PLAYSKOOL. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new forms and formats over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with an owned or controlled brand. By focusing on these brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2013 net revenues from the Companys franchise brands increased by 15% and totaled 44% of total consolidated net revenues.  

The Companys innovative product offerings encompass a broad variety of toys including boys action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls toys, electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive products, creative play and toy-related specialty products. Games offerings include boys action, board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games.  

While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its owned or controlled brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths

 and allow the Company to offer innovative products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties. The Companys primary licenses include its agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (Marvel) for characters in the Marvel universe, including SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS; Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (Lucas), related to the STAR WARS brand; Sesame Workshop, related to the SESAME STREET characters and Rovio Entertainment Ltd. related to the ANGRY BIRDS brand. Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company (Disney). Sales of MARVEL products are dependent upon the number and type of theatrical releases in any given year. In 2013, the Company and Disney amended both the Marvel and Lucas agreements which extended the term of the license for Marvel characters through 2020 and provides additional guaranteed royalty payments with respect to both MARVEL and STAR WARS products in anticipation of expected future motion pictures and other related entertainment through 2020. In 2013, the Company had sales of MARVEL products related to the May 2013 release of IRON MAN 3; however, these sales were not as significant as those sales of products in 2012 related to the theatrical releases of MARVELS THE AVENGERS and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. During 2014 the Company will market products related to three planned theatrical motion picture releases based on MARVEL properties, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. The Company re-introduced BEYBLADE products, another licensed entertainment property, during the second half of 2010 and had significant sales in both 2011 and 2012. Sales of BEYBLADE products experienced an expected decline in 2013. In addition to offering products based on licensed entertainment properties, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors.  

The Company also seeks to build all-encompassing brand experiences and drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its brands through entertainment such as motion pictures and television programming. Since 2007, the Company has had a number of motion pictures based on its brands released by major motion picture studios including three motion pictures based on its TRANSFORMERS brand, two motion picture based on its G.I. JOE brand and one motion picture based on its gaming mega brand, BATTLESHIP. The Company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. The next motion picture, TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION, based on the Companys TRANSFORMERS brand is scheduled to be released in June of 2014 by Paramount Pictures.  

In addition to using motion pictures to provide entertainment experiences for its brands, the Company has an internal wholly-owned production studio, Hasbro Studios, which is responsible for the creation and development of television programming based primarily on Hasbros brands. This programming is currently aired in markets throughout the world. The Company is a 50% partner in a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. (Discovery) which runs Hub Television Network, LLC (Hub Network), a cable television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality childrens and family entertainment. Programming on Hub Network includes content based on Hasbros brands as well as programming acquired from third parties. Hasbro Studios programming is distributed domestically to Hub Network, internationally to broadcasters and cable networks and on various digital platforms including Netflix and iTunes. The Companys television initiatives support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format.  

The Companys strategic blueprint and brand architecture also focus on extending its brands further into digital media and gaming, including through the licensing of the Companys properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands. One example of these digital gaming relationships is the Companys agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) under which EA has the rights to develop eight of Hasbros best-selling gaming brands for mobile platforms globally. Similarly, the Company has an agreement with Activision under which Activision offers digital games based on the TRANSFORMERS brand, as well as with other third-party digital gaming companies, including DeNA and GameLoft.  

Furthermore, on July 8, 2013, the Company acquired a 70% majority stake in Backflip Studios, LLC (Backflip), a mobile game developer based in Boulder, Colorado. Backflips product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including DRAGONVALE, NINJUMP and PAPER TOSS. In 2014 and beyond, Backflip intends to focus on its existing product lines and launch new games, including those based on Hasbro brands.

The Company also seeks to express its brands through its lifestyle licensing business. Under its lifestyle licensing programs, the Company enters into relationships with a broad spectrum of apparel, food, bedding and other lifestyle products companies for the global marketing and distribution of licensed products based on the Companys brands. These relationships further broaden and amplify the consumers ability to experience the Companys brands.  

As the Company seeks to grow its business in entertainment, licensing and digital gaming, the Company will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions, like Backflip, which may complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms and formats.  

During the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company announced a multi-year cost savings initiative in which it targets annual cost reductions of $100,000 by the end of 2015. This plan included an approximate 10% workforce reduction, facility consolidations and process improvements which reduce redundancy and increase efficiencies. During 2013, the Company incurred restructuring and related pension charges of $43,702 and product-related charges of $19,736 related to this plan in addition to charges of $36,046 recognized during the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, the Company recognized gross cost savings, before restructuring costs, from these actions of approximately $50,000. These savings are prior to other costs which have or are anticipated to increase in 2013 and in future years, such as compensation costs and other investments in certain components of the business.  

The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the second half of the year accounted for 65%, 64% and 63% of the Companys net revenues, respectively.  

The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. In recent years, the Companys international net revenues have experienced growth as the Company has sought to increase its international presence. Net revenues of the Companys International segment represented 46%, 44% and 43% of total net revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company has driven international growth by opportunistically opening offices in certain markets, primarily emerging markets, to develop a greater presence. Emerging markets offer greater opportunity for revenue growth than in developed economies which have faced challenging economic environments in recent years. In 2013 and 2012, net revenues from emerging markets increased by 25% and 16%, respectively, and represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in each of these years.  

The Companys business is separated into three principal business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the United States and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South American toy and game marketing and sales operations. The Companys Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Companys lifestyle licensing, digital licensing and gaming, movie and television entertainment operations. In addition to these three primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment.  

The Company is committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, from 2005 through 2013, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) adopted seven successive share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $3,325,000. The seventh authorization was approved in August 2013 for $500,000. At December 29, 2013, the Company had $524,822 remaining available under theses authorizations. During the three years ended 2013, the Company spent a total of $625,554, to repurchase 15,424 shares in the open market. The Company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions, the Companys other potential uses of cash and the Companys levels of cash generation. In addition to the share repurchase program, the Company also seeks to return excess cash through the payment of quarterly dividends. In February 2014 the Companys Board increased the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.43 per share, an 8% increase from the prior year quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. This was the tenth dividend increase in the previous 11 years. During that period, the Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.03 to $0.43 per share.

The fiscal years ended December 29, 2013 and December 25, 2011 were each fifty-two week periods while the fiscal year ended December 30, 2012 was a fifty-three week period.  

Net earnings, including the impact of noncontrolling interests in Backflip, for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 were $283,928. Net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 were $286,198, or $2.17 per diluted share.

Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for each fiscal year in the three years ended December 29, 2013 include certain charges and benefits as described below.  

During 2013, the Company was involved in a dispute with an inventor related to the contractual interpretation of which products are subject to payment of royalties under a license agreement between the inventor and the Company which was adjudicated in binding arbitration. The arbitrator ultimately issued a ruling which awarded $70,046, including damages, interest, fees and expenses to the inventor. In February 2014, the Company and the inventor settled claims arising from or relating to this license agreement and a license agreement between the parties relating to the Companys SUPER SOAKER product line for $58,040.

Net earnings for 2011 includes an unfavorable impact of $9,178, or $0.07 per diluted share, resulting from costs associated with the reorganization of the Companys games business announced during the second quarter of 2011. Net earnings for 2011 also includes a $0.15 per diluted share favorable tax benefit resulting from the settlement of tax examinations.  

In July 2013 the Company acquired a 70% majority interest in Backflip. The Company is consolidating the financial results of Backflip in its consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, reported revenues, costs and expenses, assets and liabilities, and cash flows include 100% of Backflip, with the 30% noncontrolling interests share reported as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations, and redeemable noncontrolling interests on the consolidated balance sheets. The results of operations for the year ended December 29, 2013 include the operations of Backflip from the acquisition closing date of July 8, 2013 and are reported in the Entertainment and Licensing segment.  

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 29, 2013 were $4,082,157 compared to $4,088,983 in 2012 and $4,285,589 in 2011. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 2012 were impacted by favorable/(unfavorable) foreign currency translation of approximately $3,700 and $(98,500), respectively. The following table presents net revenues by product category for the years ended December 29, 2013, December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the year ended December 29, 2013, decreased net revenues in boys category were almost wholly offset by increases in the games, girls and preschool categories. For the year ended December 30, 2012, decreased net revenues in the boys and preschool categories were partially offset by increases in the girls and games categories.  

BOYS: Net revenues in the boys category decreased 22% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of lower net sales of products related to the key licensed brands BEYBLADE, MARVEL and, to a lesser extent, STAR WARS. In 2012, net revenues benefited from higher sales of MARVEL products based on the theatrical releases of MARVELS THE AVENGERS and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. During 2013, the Companys MARVEL sales were primarily related to the theatrical release of IRON MAN 3. The Companys franchise brands, TRANSFORMERS and NERF, experienced moderate growth in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of successful television programming and product innovation. Net revenues in the boys category decreased 13% in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of lower net revenues from TRANSFORMERS and BEYBLADE products, which were partially offset by higher sales of MARVEL products, primarily due to sales of products based on the aforementioned theatrical releases. In 2011, TRANSFORMERS net revenues were positively impacted by the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON in June 2011. Also, 2011 marked the first full year of sales of BEYBLADE products, which were re-introduced during the second half of 2010.  

GAMES: Net revenues in the games category increased 10% in 2013 compared to 2012. Several brands contributed to this growth including, but not limited to, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, JENGA, including sales of products co-branded under ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS, ELEFUN & FRIENDS, MONOPOLY, including the introduction of MONOPOLY EMPIRE products, DUEL MASTERS, and TWISTER, including TWISTER RAVE. These higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands, including BATTLESHIP and SCRABBLE. Net revenues increased 2% in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher net  

32  

Table of Contents 

 revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, BATTLESHIP and TWISTER, as well as the introduction of boys action gaming products, which included STAR WARS FIGHTER PODS, ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS and TRANSFORMERS BOT SHOTS. These higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands, including SCRABBLE, CONNECT 4 and YAHTZEE.  

GIRLS: Net revenues in the girls category increased 26% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily related to higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY, FURBY and NERF REBELLE products. Net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products have gained momentum with support from the successful television program, MY LITTLE PONY: FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC, as well as the third quarter 2013 introduction of MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS fashion doll products which was supported by the release of an animated movie in summer of 2013. Also, 2013 was the first full year of net revenues from FURBY products including the introduction of FURBY in non-English speaking markets. Lastly, NERF REBELLE, a line of action performance products, was successfully launched during the second half of 2013. These higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products. Net revenues in the girls category increased 7% in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to new initiatives including the introduction of FURBY in English-speaking markets as well as ONE DIRECTION products. Higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products, supported by the aforementioned television programming, also contributed to growth in the girls category. These higher net revenues were partially offset by decreased net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, FURREAL FRIENDS and STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products.  

PRESCHOOL: Net revenues in the preschool category increased 1% in 2013 compared to 2012. Higher net revenues from PLAY-DOH, PLAYSKOOL HEROES, specifically TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS, and SESAME STREET, including BIG HUGS ELMO, products were almost wholly offset by lower net revenues from TONKA and PLAYSKOOL products. In 2013, the Company elected to out-license the distribution of TONKA products to a third-party, thereby earning licensing revenue in 2013 compared to wholesale revenue in 2012. Net revenues in the preschool category decreased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011. Increased net revenues from PLAY-DOH were more than offset by declines in SESAME STREET and TONKA products.  

The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

U.S. and Canada  

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 29, 2013 decreased 5% compared to 2012 and 6% in 2012 compared to 2011. The impact of currency translation was not material in 2013 and 2012. Lower net revenues in 2013 were partially due to continued challenging economic conditions which resulted in lower consumer spending; however, the U.S. and Canada Segment did achieve growth in franchise brands in 2013. In 2013 and 2012, lower net revenues from boys and preschool products were only partially offset by higher net revenues from girls and games products.  

33  

Table of Contents 

In the boys category, lower sales of MARVEL, BEYBLADE and STAR WARS products in 2013 compared to 2012 more than offset slightly higher net revenues from NERF and TRANSFORMERS products. In 2012, higher sales of MARVEL products, particularly entertainment-based products related to THE AVENGERS and SPIDER-MAN, compared to 2011 were more than offset by lower net revenues from TRANSFORMERS, STAR WARS, BEYBLADE and NERF products. 2011 TRANSFORMERS revenues were positively impacted by the movie release.  

In the games category, higher net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, ELEFUN & FRIENDS, DUEL MASTERS, JENGA, OPERATION and TWISTER products in 2013 compared to 2012 more than offset lower net revenues from other traditional board games. In 2012, higher net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TWISTER, BATTLESHIP and boys action gaming products, primarily STAR WARS and TRANSFORMERS products, were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands.  

In the girls category, higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products along with the introduction of NERF REBELLE products contributed to the categorys growth in 2013. This growth was only partially offset by lower net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, ONE DIRECTION, BABY ALIVE and FURBY products. In 2012, higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY and EASY BAKE products as well as the introduction of FURBY and ONE DIRECTION products contributed to growth in the girls category. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenues from FURREAL FRIENDS, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, LITTLEST PET SHOP and BABY ALIVE products in 2012.  

In the preschool category, higher net revenues from SESAME STREET, PLAY-DOH and PLAYSKOOL HEROES products, primarily related to the TRANSFORMERS brand, were more than offset by lower net revenues from PLAYSKOOL and TONKA products. In 2012, increased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL HEROES, primarily related to MARVEL characters, and to a lesser extent higher net revenues from PLAY-DOH products, were more than offset by decreased sales of SESAME STREET and TONKA products.  

U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 15% in 2012 compared to 2011. Operating profit margin improved to 15.6% in 2013 compared to 15.1% in 2012. Operating profit for the year ended December 30, 2012 includes restructuring charges of $2,444. Absent these charges, operating profit margin was 15.2% in 2012. Operating profit decreased in dollars as a result of the impact of lower net revenues and, to a lesser extent, higher product development and selling, distribution and administration expenses partially offset by lower advertising expense. Operating profit margin increased as a result of improved product mix and lower advertising expense as a percentage of net revenues partially offset by higher product development and selling, distribution and administration expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Operating profit margin improved to 15.1% in 2012 compared to 12.4% in 2011. The increase in operating profit and margin was primarily the result of product mix as well as improved inventory management, which resulted in lower inventory obsolescence costs in 2012 compared to 2011. Changes in product mix included a reduced impact from closeout sales in 2012 compared to 2011. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on U.S. and Canada operating profit in 2013 or 2012.  

International  

International segment net revenues for the year ended December 29, 2013 increased 5% compared to 2012 while net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2012 decreased 4% compared to 2011. In 2013 and 2012, net revenues were impacted by favorable/(unfavorable) currency translation of approximately $7,000 and $(98,000), respectively, as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net revenues for 2013 and 2012 increased 5% and 1%, respectively, compared to prior years.

The following table presents net revenues by geographic region for the Companys International segment for 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2013, a positive impact from currency translation of approximately $27,400 for Europe was partially offset by a negative impact from currency translation of approximately $14,400 and $6,000 for the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, respectively. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, 2013 net revenues grew 1%, 16% and 6% for Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively, compared to 2012. Growth in International segment net revenues in 2013 was primarily driven by growth in emerging markets, including Russia, Brazil and China. Net revenues in emerging markets increased 25% in 2013 compared to 2012, and were partially offset by lower net revenues in certain developed markets including Australia, France and the United Kingdom. In 2012, a negative impact from currency translation of $79,100 and $20,000 for Europe and Latin America, respectively, in addition to challenging economic environments in certain developed economies contributed to the overall decline in net revenues for the segment. Currency translation did not have a material impact on net revenues for the Asia Pacific region in 2012. In 2012, net revenues in Latin America increased 14% and net revenues in Europe decreased 2% compared to 2011, absent the impact of foreign exchange. Net revenues in emerging international markets, including Brazil, Russia and Colombia, increased 16% in 2012 compared to 2011.  

By product category, growth in the games, girls and preschool categories in 2013 was partially offset by lower net revenues in the boys category. In 2012, the decrease in net revenues was predominantly the result of lower net revenues from boys products and marginally lower net revenues from games and girls products while net revenues from preschool products were flat for the year.  

In the boys category, lower sales of BEYBLADE, MARVEL, STAR WARS and KRE-O products in 2013 were partially offset by higher net revenues from TRANSFROMERS and NERF products. In 2012, higher net revenues from MARVEL, particularly entertainment-based products related to THE AVENGERS and SPIDER-MAN, and STAR WARS products in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by lower net revenues from BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS products.  

In the games category, higher net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, JENGA, TWISTER, ELEFUN & FRIENDS and action battling gaming products in 2013 compared to 2012 were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands. In 2012, higher net revenues from boys action gaming products, primarily related to STAR WARS and TRANSFORMERS brands, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TWISTER and BATTLESHIP products in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by decreased net revenues from other game brands.  

The girls category grew approximately 47% in 2013 compared to 2012 attributable to higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products as well as the introduction of FURBY products in non-English speaking markets and NERF REBELLE products. This growth was partially offset by lower net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products. In 2012, higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY compared to 2011 as well as the introduction of FURBY products were more than offset by lower net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products. FURBY products were introduced in English-speaking markets in 2012 and globally in 2013.  

In the preschool category, higher net revenues from PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS products in 2013 were partially offset by lower net revenues from TONKA and SESAME STREET products. In 2012, net revenues in the preschool category were flat compared to 2011. Increased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL

 HEROES products, primarily MARVEL-related, and PLAY-DOH products were wholly offset by decreased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL and SESAME STREET products.  

International segment operating profit increased 9% in 2013 compared to 2012 and decreased 20% in 2012 compared to 2011. Operating profit margin increased to 12.6% of net revenues in 2013 from 12.1% of net revenues in 2012 and decreased in 2012 from 14.5% of net revenues in 2011. Operating profit for the International segment in 2013 and 2012 was impacted by approximately $4,700 and $(11,900), respectively, due to the favorable/(unfavorable) impact from translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. Operating profit for the year ended December 30, 2012 includes restructuring charges of $1,628. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the operating profit margin in 2012 was 12.2%. In 2013, operating profit and margins improved primarily due to higher net revenues discussed above. While most operating expenses increased in dollars, they decreased as a percent of net revenues. In 2012, decreases in operating profit and operating profit margin were primarily due to lower net revenues discussed above in addition to higher selling, distribution and administration expenses. Higher cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues was partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result of the mix of entertainment-based and non-entertainment based product sales. Further, the decline in operating profit margin in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the change in geographical mix of net revenues, with a higher percentage coming from emerging markets, which currently have lower operating profit margins than the Company has in developed markets.  

Entertainment and Licensing  

Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 5% in 2013 compared to 2012 and 12% in 2012 compared to 2011. Increased net revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 is predominately the result of investment to grow the Companys global licensing organization, particularly lifestyle licensing, and expand into emerging markets as well as diversification in strategic digital gaming partnerships including the acquisition of a majority stake in Backflip. These higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from distribution of television programming, specifically digital distribution, as 2012 net revenues include the initial distribution of Hasbro Studios television programming libraries to Netflix. Higher net revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 were primarily due to the sale and distribution of television programming which included global television distribution, digital distribution and home entertainment, partially offset by decreased net revenues from lifestyle licensing primarily relating to lower TRANSFORMERS movie-related licensing revenues.  

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit decreased 15% in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 24% in 2012 compared to 2011. Operating profit for 2013 and 2012 includes restructuring charges of $1,729 and $555, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges, increased operating profit from lifestyle and digital gaming licensing was offset by operating losses from entertainment and the addition of Backflip. Operating profit for 2013 includes an approximate $7,600 operating loss for Backflip, primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles. In 2012, higher net revenues from television programming distribution directly contributed to an increased operating profit.  

Other Segments and Corporate and Eliminations  

In the Global Operations segment, an operating profit of $6,712 in 2013 compared to operating losses of $15,964 and $7,948 in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The operating loss in 2012 included severance costs of $4,307 associated with restructuring activities. The improvement in operating results in the Global Operations segment is primarily due to improvements made in owned manufacturing facilities and expense reductions associated with restructuring activities.  

In Corporate and Eliminations, operating losses of $134,323 and $20,003 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to operating profit of $10,211 in 2011. Corporate and Eliminations includes restructuring and related pension charges of $41,973 for the year ended December 29, 2013 and restructuring charges of $38,242 and $14,385 for the years ended December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011, respectively. The Corporate and

 Eliminations operating loss during the year ended December 29, 2013 also included charges of $46,050 related to the settlement of an adverse arbitration award and $40,587 in other product-related charges. Lastly, the 2013 operating loss also includes a charge related to the write-off of early film development costs associated with films that had not yet moved to production.  

Operating Expenses  

The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 29, 2013:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 include expenses related to the following events:  

       In February 2014, the Company settled outstanding disputes with an inventor related to the contractual interpretation of which products are subject to payment of royalties under two license agreements between the inventor and the Company relating to the Companys NERF and SUPER SOAKER product lines. As a result, the Company has recorded a total charge of $61,140, of which $42,950 and $3,100 were recorded to royalties and selling, distribution and administration expense, respectively, for the year ended December 29, 2013. A portion of this total charge was also recorded to interest expense which is discussed below.  

       During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company announced a multi-year cost savings initiative which targets $100,000 in annual savings by the end of 2015, prior to other costs which have or are anticipated to increase in 2014 as well as in future years. This initiative included an approximate 10% workforce reduction, facility consolidations and process improvements. The Company recognized charges totaling $36,710 and $36,046 for the years ended December 29, 2013 and December 30, 2012, respectively, primarily related to employee severance charges, which impacted cost of sales, product development and selling, distribution and administration expenses. Furthermore, the Company also recognized pension curtailment and settlement charges in the amount of $6,993 in selling, distribution and administration expense during the year ended December 29, 2013.  

       During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company decided to exit certain brands which were non-core to its franchise brand strategy. Certain of these brands related to prior acquisitions and had intangible assets, resulting in a write-off of these intangibles of $19,736, which have been recorded to amortization of intangibles for the year ended December 29, 2013.  

       During the fourth quarter of 2013 the Company amended its license agreement with Zynga which resulted in additional royalty expense of $20,851.  

       In the first quarter of 2012 the Company incurred employee severance charges of $11,130 associated with measures to right size certain businesses and functions. These charges impacted cost of sales, product development and selling, distribution and administration expense for the year ended December 30, 2012.  

       In 2011, the Company incurred costs of $14,385 associated with establishing Hasbros Gaming Center of Excellence. These charges impacted product development and selling, distribution and administration charges for the year ended December 25, 2011.

In total, these expenses were recorded to the consolidated statements of operations as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. Cost of sales increased to $1,672,901, or 41.0% of net revenues, for the year ended December 29, 2013 from $1,671,980, or 40.9% of net revenues, for the year ended December 30, 2012. Absent the impact of aforementioned charges, cost of sales decreased to $1,662,747, or 40.7% of net revenues, for the year ended December 29, 2013 from $1,669,216, or 40.8% of net revenues, for the year ended December 30, 2012 as a result of favorable product mix partially offset by the impact on net revenues of higher sales promotions. Cost of sales decreased to 40.8% of net revenues, absent charges, for the year ended December 30, 2012 from 42.8% in 2011. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues in 2012 was positively impacted by product mix, which included higher MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues, which typically have lower costs of sales as a percentage of net revenues. Further, the impact of closeout sales improved in 2012 compared to 2011. In addition, cost of sales was positively impacted by lower inventory obsolescence costs in 2012 compared to 2011.  

Royalty expense of $338,919, or 8.3% of net revenues, for the year ended December 29, 2013 compared to $302,066, or 7.4% of net revenues, for the year ended December 30, 2012 and $339,217, or 7.9% of net revenues, for the year ended December 25, 2011. Excluding the impact of the arbitration award settlement and amendment of the Zynga agreement summarized above, royalty expense decreased to $275,118, or 6.7% of net revenues, in 2013. Fluctuations in royalty expense are generally related to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given year, especially if there is a major motion picture release. Significant sales of MARVEL products, particularly those related to MARVELS THE AVENGERS and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, in 2012 and BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products in 2011 resulted in higher royalty expenses in those years compared to 2013.  

Product development expense in 2013 totaled $207,591, or 5.1% of net revenues, compared to $201,197, or 4.9% of net revenues, in 2012 and $197,638, or 4.6% of net revenues, in 2011. Product development expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes restructuring charges of $4,101, $10,949 and $6,744, respectively. Excluding the impact of these charges, product development expense increased to $203,490 in 2013 compared to $190,248 in 2012 and $190,894 in 2011. The increase in 2013 reflects the addition of Backflip as well as investments in certain brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, partially offset by cost savings related to reduction in headcount.  

Advertising expense in 2013 decreased to $398,098, or 9.8% of net revenues, compared to $422,239, or 10.3% of net revenues, in 2012 and $413,951, or 9.7% of net revenues, in 2011. The level of the Companys advertising expense can generally be impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases, and television programming. The decrease in advertising expense in 2013 was the result of the mix of 2013 net revenues as well as a higher portion of our spending in digital formats. Increased advertising in 2012 compared to 2011 in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenue is, in part, due to the Companys strategy to increase its spend in consumer-facing marketing and advertising.  

Amortization of intangibles increased to $78,186, or 1.9% of net revenues, compared to $50,569, or 1.3% of net revenues, in 2012 and $46,647, or 1.1% of net revenues, in 2011. Amortization of intangibles in 2013 includes $19,736 related to impairment of definite-lived intangibles based on the Companys decision to exit the related product lines. Absent the impact of these charges, amortization of intangibles increased to $58,450, or  

38  

Table of Contents 

 1.4% of net revenues, in 2013 reflecting the addition of Backflip. Increased amortization in 2012 compared to 2011 was the result of higher expense related to certain intangibles that are amortized based on actual and projected net revenues.  

Program production cost amortization increased to $47,690, or 1.2% of net revenues, in 2013 compared to $41,800, or 1.0% of net revenues, in 2012 and $35,798, or 0.8% of net revenues, in 2011. Program production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. Increasing program production cost amortization reflects the level of revenues associated with television programming as well as the type of television programs produced and distributed in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2011.  

Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $871,679, or 21.3% of net revenues, in 2013 compared to $847,347, or 20.7% of net revenues, in 2012 and $822,094, or 19.2% of net revenues, in 2011. Selling, distribution and administration expense for 2013 includes $32,547 of restructuring and related pension charges, and legal costs associated with the arbitration settlement while 2012 and 2011 included $33,463 and $7,641, respectively, of restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, selling, distribution and administration expense increased to $839,132, or 20.6% of net revenues, in 2013 compared to $813,884, or 19.9% of net revenues, in 2012 and $814,453, or 19.0% of net revenues, in 2011. The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 reflects investments in emerging markets, information systems, new facilities, and certain brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and the acquisition of Backflip. Higher compensation and legal expenses also contributed to the increase in 2013. These investments and higher costs in 2013 more than offset savings, primarily from headcount reductions, resulting from our cost savings initiatives. Selling, distribution and administration expense decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of lower shipping and warehousing costs related to lower revenues and lower inventory balances. Increased stock compensation and bonus provisions in 2012 compared to 2011 were substantially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense increased to $105,585 in 2013 from $91,141 in 2012 and $89,022 in 2011. Interest expense in 2013 includes approximately $15,090 related to the settlement of an arbitration award. Absent these charges, interest expense was flat in 2013 compared to 2012. Increased interest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflects higher average short-term borrowings as well as the impact of the extra week of interest expense on long-term debt in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011.  

Interest Income  

Interest income was $4,925 in 2013 compared to $6,333 in 2012 and $6,834 in 2011. Decreased interest income in 2013 compared to 2012 reflects lower average interest rates. Interest income in 2011 includes approximately $1,100 in interest received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to prior years. Absent the impact of this receipt, interest income in 2012 increased compared to 2011 reflecting higher invested cash balances, primarily in international markets.  

Other (Income) Expense, Net  

Other (income) expense, net of $14,611 compares to $13,575 in 2012 and $25,400 in 2011. The slight increase in expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher net losses on foreign currency transactions and the impact of investment gains and losses. The decrease in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to lower net losses on foreign currency transactions as well as gains on investments in 2012 compared to losses on investments in 2011.  

Foreign currency exchange net losses of $5,159 in 2013 compared to $4,178 in 2012 and $8,343 in 2011. The net loss in 2011 includes $3,700 related to derivative instruments which no longer qualified for hedge accounting. Investment losses of $1,148 and $4,167 in 2013 and 2011, respectively, compared to investment gains of $(1,257) in 2012. The losses in 2013 and 2011 primarily relate to warrants to purchase common stock of an unrelated company. These warrants were exercised and related shares were sold in 2013. Other (income) expense, net in 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes $2,386, $6,015 and $7,290 respectively, relating to the Companys 50% share in the loss of Hub Network.

Income Taxes  

Income tax expense totaled 19.3% of pretax earnings in 2013 compared with 25.9% in 2012 and 20.8% in 2011. Income tax expense for 2013 includes net benefits of approximately $30,000 from discrete events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Income tax expense for 2012 includes net benefits of approximately $8,300 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the repatriation of certain highly taxed foreign earnings and to expirations of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2011 is net of a benefit of approximately $29,600 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Absent these items, potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in 2013, 2012 and 2011, and the impact of the 2013 charges related to restructuring activities, exit from certain product lines and settlement of the unfavorable arbitration award, the effective tax rates would have been 25.8%, 27.0% and 26.2%, respectively. The increase in the adjusted tax rate from 2011 to 2012 and decrease from 2012 to 2013 primarily reflect the change in the geographic mix of where the company earned its profits.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2013 the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program. During 2014, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. In the event that the Company is not able to issue commercial paper, the Company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2014, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although the Company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the Company.  

As of December 29, 2013 the Companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $682,449, the majority of which is held by international subsidiaries outside of the United States. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the Company. Accordingly, such international cash balances are not available to fund cash requirements in the United States unless the Company changes its reinvestment policy. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the United States to fund cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. If the Company changes its policy of permanently reinvesting international earnings, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the United States and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries. If the Company repatriated the funds from its international subsidiaries, it would then be required to pay the additional U.S. income tax. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States as of December 29, 2013 is denominated in the U.S. dollar.  

At December 29, 2013, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $674,117 compared to $625,336 and $461,258 at December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011, respectively. Hasbro generated $401,132, $534,796 and $396,069 of cash from its operating activities in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2013, 2012 and 2011 included $41,325, $59,277 and $80,983, respectively, of cash used for television program production. Cash from operations in 2013, 2012 and 2011 also includes long-term royalty advance payments of $25,000 made to Hub Network in each of the three years. 2013 also includes payments totaling approximately $175,000 of royalty advances paid to Disney.  

Accounts receivable, net increased to $1,093,620 at December 29, 2013 from $1,029,959 at December 30, 2012. The accounts receivable balance at December 29, 2013 includes a decrease of approximately $17,000

Table of Contents 

 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, increased accounts receivable, net primarily reflects the growth in fourth quarter net revenues in the International segment in 2013. Days sales outstanding increased to 77 days at December 29, 2013 from 72 days at December 30, 2012, primarily due to the impact of higher balances in certain international markets which have longer payment terms. Accounts receivable, net decreased to $1,029,959 at December 30, 2012 from $1,034,580 at December 25, 2011. The accounts receivable balance at December 30, 2012 included an increase of approximately $10,600 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts receivable, net decreased reflecting lower fourth quarter sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 72 days at December 30, 2012 from 70 days at December 25, 2011, primarily due to higher revenue volume in Latin America, a region which has longer payment terms.  

Inventories increased to $348,794 at December 29, 2013 from $316,049 at December 30, 2012. The inventory balance at December 29, 2013 includes a decrease of approximately $4,400 resulting from foreign currency translation. Inventory in the International segment increased approximately 16%, primarily due to higher balances in emerging markets, including Russia and Brazil, in support of the growth the Company has experienced in these markets. Inventory in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012. Inventories decreased to $316,049 at December 30, 2012 compared to $333,993 at December 25, 2011. Inventories declined 23% in the U.S. and Canada segment, partially offset by increases in certain international markets including Russia, China and Korea.  

Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $355,594 at December 29, 2013 from $312,493 at December 30, 2012. Higher prepaid royalties, primarily related to the Companys amended agreements with Disney related to its MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses, contributed to increased balances in 2013 compared to 2012. Prepaid expenses and other current assets also includes approximately $3,200 related to a forward-starting interest rate swap contract which hedges future interest payments on the expected refinancing of the Companys 6.125% Notes Due 2014. These increases were partially offset by lower non-income based tax receivables, primarily value added taxes in Europe, compared to 2012 as a result of collections in 2013. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $312,493 at December 30, 2012 from $243,431 at December 25, 2011. The balance at December 30, 2012 included an increase of approximately $5,500 as a result of translation of foreign currency. Absent the impact of foreign currency translation, increases in prepaid royalties, primarily related to prepaid royalties previously recorded as long-term which have become current related to the MARVEL license, as well as deferred income taxes were partially offset by lower non-income-based tax receivables compared to 2011 as a result of collections in 2012.  

Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $926,558 at December 29, 2013 from $736,070 at December 30, 2012. The balance includes a decrease of approximately $6,300 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. Higher accrued royalties, interest and dividends as well as higher accounts payable contributed to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2013 compared to 2012. These increases include accrued royalties of $42,950 and accrued interest of $15,090 related to the settlement of an adverse arbitration award. Higher accrued dividends reflect a decision by the Companys Board in 2012 to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in December 2012 from February 2013 to December 2012. As such, there were no accrued dividends at December 30, 2012. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $736,070 at December 30, 2012 from $761,914 at December 25, 2011. The 2012 balance includes an increase of approximately $8,300 as a result of the translation of foreign currency balances. The decrease was partially the result of the changes in accrued dividends discussed above as well as a decrease in accrued royalties resulting from lower sales of entertainment-based products as well as lower accrued non-income-based taxes. These lower balances were partially offset by severance costs accrued in the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as higher accrued payroll and management incentives.  

Other liabilities of $351,304 at December 29, 2013 compared to $461,152 at December 30, 2012 and $370,043 at December 25, 2011. The decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to lower liabilities related to pension and uncertain tax positions. The decline in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is primarily due to the settlement of tax examinations during 2013, partially offset by additions for current year activity. The decline in pension liabilities is primarily due to increased discount rates, and, to a lesser extent,

 increased benefit payments due to a higher level of retirements during 2013 resulting from an early retirement program in the United States relating to the cost savings initiative. The increase in other liabilities in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to higher liabilities for pension and uncertain tax positions.  

Cash flows utilized by investing activities were $217,743, $106,172 and $107,615 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $112,031, $112,091 and $99,402 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Of these additions, 51% in 2013, 45% in 2012 and 66% in 2011 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2014, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $125,000 to $135,000. During the three years ended December 29, 2013, the depreciation of plant and equipment was $102,799, $99,718 and $113,821, respectively. Fluctuations in depreciation of plant and equipment correlate with the percentage of additions to property, plant and equipment relating to tools, dies and molds which have shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation. Cash utilized for investments and acquisitions was $110,698 and $11,585 in 2013 and 2011, respectively. No investments or acquisitions were made in 2012. The 2013 utilization represents the Companys acquisition of a majority stake in Backflip as well as a payment related to an existing intellectual property while the 2011 utilization represents the Companys purchase of that same intellectual property.  

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit.  

The Company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program (the Program). Under the Program, at the request of the Company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the Company, or arrange for the sale by the Company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. The Company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $700,000. The maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. Borrowings under the Program are supported by the Companys $700,000 revolving credit agreement. At December 29, 2013, there were no notes outstanding related to the Program.  

The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides the Company with a $700,000 committed borrowing facility. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 29, 2013. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of December 29, 2013 were approximately $1,000. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 29, 2013 were approximately $699,000. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $29,600 was utilized at December 29, 2013. Of the amount utilized under, or supported by, the uncommitted lines, approximately $8,300 and $21,300 represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.  

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $341,009 in 2013 compared to $219,379 in 2012 and $375,685 in 2011. Of these amounts, $103,488, $98,005 and $423,008 reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company repurchased 2,268, 2,694 and 10,461 shares at an average price of $45.17, $37.11 and $40.42, respectively. At December 29, 2013, $524,822 remained under outstanding Board authorizations. Dividends paid were $156,129 in 2013 compared to $225,464 in 2012 and $154,028 in 2011. Dividends paid in 2012 include an

 additional dividend payment resulting from a decision by the Companys Board to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in December 2012, which historically would have been paid in February 2013, to December 2012. This acceleration resulted in one less quarterly dividend paid in 2013. Further, the Company has increased its quarterly dividend rate from $0.30 in 2011 to $0.40 in 2013. Lastly, repayments of other short-term borrowings of $215,273 in 2013 compared to proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $43,106 and $167,339 in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company generated cash from employee stock option transactions of $118,122, $54,963 and $29,798 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

For the $350,000 in notes due in 2017 which bear interest at 6.30%, interest rates may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+, respectively, or below. At December 29, 2013, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.  

Including the notes described above, the Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 29, 2013 of approximately $1,384,895 due at varying times from 2014 through 2040. $425,000 of this long-term debt is due May 2014; however, the Company currently expects to issue long-term notes in order to finance most, if not all, of the repayment of this debt. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of $209,398 and purchase commitments of $297,817 outstanding at December 29, 2013. Letters of credit and similar instruments include $187,130 of bonds related to the defense of tax assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $17,560 in 2014.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates  

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.  

Sales Allowances  

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.  

For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically  

43  

Table of Contents 

 against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2013, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates made in prior years.  

Program Production Costs  

The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the Companys toy and game brands, including animated and live-action programs and game shows. These costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.  

The most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. Ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. Ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy, game and other merchandise licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as DVD and digital distribution. Our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. We review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. When estimates for a television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. Prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. Factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the U.S. which are distributed on Hub Network and available on Netflix and iTunes, our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.  

For the year ended December 29, 2013 we have $79,965 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We currently expect that approximately 93% of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3-year period 2014 through 2016. Future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues. During 2013 the Company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs.  

Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value. No reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test. Accordingly, no impairment was indicated. The Companys annual impairment tests related to  

44  

Table of Contents 

 intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 29, 2013, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $670,059 recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.  

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $300,261 at December 29, 2013. During 2013, the Company incurred $19,736 in impairment charges relating to reduced expectations for certain products as well as the decision to exit certain other product lines.  

Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

The Companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 29, 2013, the Company had $294,991 of prepaid royalties, $152,459 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $142,532 of which are included in other assets. During 2013, the Company incurred $20,851 related to the amendment of its license agreement with Zynga. As a result of this settlement, the Company agreed to pay Zynga $12,500 in satisfaction of all future required royalty advances, with the remainder of the charge comprised of a write-down of prepaid royalties.  

Pension Costs and Obligations  

Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. The Company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year. During 2013, the Company recognized pension curtailment and settlement charges of $6,993 related to its U.S. pension plans as a result of headcount reductions due to restructuring activities.  

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment  

45  

Table of Contents 

 classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2013 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 7.00%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2013 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $630.  

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Companys weighted average discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2013 pension expense was 4.49%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2013 pension expense by approximately $459.  

Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 29, 2013, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $69,716 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $138,946 at December 30, 2012. The decrease primarily reflects unrecognized actuarial gains in 2013 compared to losses in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at December 29, 2013 as well as benefits paid in 2013 related to workforce reductions. The discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at December 29, 2013 increased to 5.02% at December 29, 2013 from 4.09% used at December 30, 2012. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased the 2013 projected benefit obligation by approximately $9,722. Pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.  

Income Taxes  

The Companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the Companys interim results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys interim results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2013 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2013, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately $30,000 associated with discrete tax events, primarily related to the completion of U.S. tax examinations as well as certain other U.S. and foreign prior period tax adjustments.  

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize  

46  

Table of Contents 

 the future deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Companys income tax return. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the Company. In the event the Company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the United States and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries. At December 29, 2013, the difference between the tax rates in the United States and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately $492,000.  

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,384,895 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 29, 2013. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 29, 2013 are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 29, 2013, the Company has a liability, including potential interest and penalties, of $80,006 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.  

In connection with the Companys agreement to form a joint venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.  

In July 2013, the Company acquired a 70% stake in Backflip and will be required to purchase the remaining 30% in the future contingent on the achievement by Backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics. The Company does not know the ultimate timing that these predetermined financial performance metrics may be met and, thereby, cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30%.  

In July 2013, the Company amended agreements with Disney related to its MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses which provide for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. In connection with the Marvel amendment, the Marvel license has been extended through 2020 and may require up to $170,000 in guaranteed royalties that are not included in the table above, are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be  

47  

Table of Contents 

 payable during the next six years. Approximately $50,000 of these additional royalties are expected to be paid in 2014 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases. Additional guaranteed royalties related to the amendment of the STAR WARS license agreement are included in the table above.  

Purchase commitments represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business. The reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2013.  

In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $6,400 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International pension plans in 2014. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $209,398 at December 29, 2013.  

The Company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations described above.  

Financial Risk Management  

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.  

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $48,144 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.  

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.  

The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 29, 2013, these contracts had net unrealized losses of $10,875, of which $386 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $1,069 are recorded in other assets, $(10,260) are recorded in accrued liabilities, and $(2,070) are recorded in other liabilities. Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December 29, 2013 are deferred losses of $9,337, net of tax, related to these derivatives.  

At December 29, 2013, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt, excluding adjustments, of $1,384,895. The Company was party to several interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $400,000, to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps were matched with specific long-term debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long-term debt. In November 2012, these interest rate swap agreements were terminated. The fair value was recorded as an adjustment to long-term debt and is now being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations over the life of the remaining long-term debt using a straight-line method. At December 29, 2013, this adjustment to long-term debt was $3,390. As a result of this termination long-term debt  

48  

Table of Contents 

 is no longer affected by variable interest rates and, thereby, earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates. The Company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt, excluding the current portion, by approximately $23,000.  

Of the $1,384,895 in fixed rate long-term debt at December 29, 2013, $425,000 matures in May 2014. The Company currently expects to issue long-term notes in 2014 to finance the repayment of most, if not all, of this debt. As such, during the fourth quarter of 2013 the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with total notional value of $300,000 to hedge the anticipated underlying U.S. Treasury interest rate associated with the expected issuance of long-term debt to refinance most, if not all, of the aforementioned current portion of long-term debt. These interest rate swaps were matched with the expected long-term debt issuance and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments. The fair value of these instruments is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive earnings and will be amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method once the expected debt issuance occurs. At December 29, 2013, the fair value of these instruments is $3,172 and is recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets.  

The Economy and Inflation  

The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 39% of its consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 42% and 45% of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2013, approximately 65% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. The Company expects that this concentration will continue. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. Larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes Christmas.  

Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys future revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.  

The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2013 was not significant and the Company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

Other Information  

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
