ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

All financial instruments held by the Company described below are held for purposes other than trading. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The tables below provides information about long-term debt issued by the Company and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and related maturities. Fair values for debt and swaps represent quoted market prices.

While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur. 

The above tables exclude long-term debt of $37 million at December 31, 2008 and $72 million at December 31, 2007, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them. 

In June 2007 SCANA entered into an agreement to issue and sell Floating Rate Senior Notes due June 1, 2034, in an aggregate principal amount of between $90 million and $110 million. In each of December 2008 and 2007, SCANA issued $40 million of the Floating Rate Senior Notes. The remainder of the notes are to be issued in June 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008 SCANA entered into a forward starting swap agreement with a notional amount of $20 million in anticipation of the June 2009 issuance. At December 31, 2008 the estimated fair value of this swap totaled $2.8 million (loss), which is not reflected in the tables above. 

In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCE&G entered into a forward starting swap agreement in anticipation of the issuance of future debt. At December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of the Company’s forward starting swap totaled $43.7 million (loss) related to notional amounts of $150 million, which is not reflected in the tables above. 

Commodity Price Risk

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge forward purchases and sales of natural gas, which create market risks of different types. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The NYMEX futures information above includes those financial positions of Energy Marketing, SCE&G and PSNC Energy. SCE&G’s tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The SCPSC has ruled that the results of these hedging activities are to be included in the PGA. As such, costs of related derivatives utilized by SCE&G to hedge gas purchasing activities are recoverable through the weighted average cost of gas calculation. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is deferred. PSNC Energy utilizes futures, options and swaps to hedge gas purchasing activities. PSNC Energy’s tariffs also include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy defers premiums, transaction fees, margin requirements and any realized gains or losses from its hedging program for subsequent recovery from customers.
