PART I

Item 1. Business

Overview

Wynn Resorts, Limited, ("Wynn Resorts," or together with its subsidiaries, "we" or the "Company"), led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Wynn, is a leading developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts) that integrate hotel accommodations and a wide range of amenities, including fine dining outlets, premium retail offerings, distinctive entertainment theaters and large meeting complexes. 

Wynn Resorts currently owns 72% of Wynn Macau, Limited, which operates an integrated resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China ("Macau"). Wynn Resorts also owns 100% of and operates an integrated resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. 

We are currently constructing Wynn Palace, an integrated resort in the Cotai area of Macau, which we expect to open in the first half of 2016; however, potential construction delays could push the opening date into the second half of 2016. We have begun site preparation and pre-construction activities for the development and construction of an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston. 

We present the operating results of our two existing integrated resorts in the following two segments: Macau Operations and Las Vegas Operations. For more information on our segments, see Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 18 "Segment Information."

Wynn Resorts, a Nevada corporation, was formed in 2002. Wynn Resorts files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments of such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Our Resorts

Macau Operations

We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006 and opened Encore at Wynn Macau, an expansion of Wynn Macau, on April 21, 2010. We refer to the integrated Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau resort as "Wynn Macau | Encore" or as our "Macau Operations." We operate Wynn Macau | Encore under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. See "Regulation and Licensing—Macau" for details on the casino concession agreement. We lease from the Macau government an approximately 16-acre parcel of land in downtown Macau's inner harbor where Wynn Macau | Encore is located. See "Item 2—Properties" for details on the land concession agreement.

Wynn Macau | Encore features the following as of February 12, 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In response to our evaluation of our Macau Operations and our commitment to creating a unique customer experience, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort. In February 2015, we completed the renovation of approximately 27,000 square feet of our casino space at Wynn Macau for new VIP gaming rooms.

Las Vegas Operations

We opened Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005 and opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, on December 22, 2008. We refer to the integrated Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas resort as "Wynn Las Vegas | Encore" or as our "Las Vegas Operations." Wynn Las Vegas | Encore is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, and occupies approximately 215 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. In addition, we own approximately 18 acres across Sands Avenue, a portion of which is utilized for employee parking and an office building, and approximately five acres adjacent to the golf course on which an office building is located. 

Wynn Las Vegas | Encore features the following as of February 12, 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Two luxury hotel towers with a total of 4,748 guest rooms, suites and villas;

•34 food and beverage outlets featuring signature chefs;

•Approximately 99,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques by Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Cartier, Chanel, Chloé, Chopard, Dior, Givenchy, Graff, Hermes, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Moncler, Nicholas Kirkwood, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Vertu and others;

•Approximately 290,000 square feet of meeting and convention space;

•Three nightclubs and a beach club;

•Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18-hole golf course, swimming pools, private cabanas, two full service spas and salons, and a wedding chapel. 

In response to our evaluation of our Las Vegas Operations and our commitment to creating a unique customer experience, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort. In October 2015, we closed the Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership inside Wynn Las Vegas. We have obtained the relevant approvals to transform the dealership and adjacent space into additional retail space. In November 2015, we completed the remodel of all guest rooms in our Encore hotel tower, completed the remodel of one of our restaurants and began the re-branding of one of our night clubs, which is scheduled for completion in April 2016. In December 2015, we opened a 5,000 square-foot luxury lounge for gaming and entertainment in Encore. 

Construction and Development Opportunities

We are currently constructing Wynn Palace, an integrated resort featuring a 1,700 room hotel, a performance lake, and a wide range of amenities, including meeting, retail, food and beverage, and gaming space, in the Cotai area of Macau. The total project budget, including construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees, is $4.1 billion. As of December 31, 2015, we have invested $3.5 billion in the project. 

In September 2011, Palo Real Estate Company Limited ("Palo") and Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A. ("Wynn Macau SA"), each an indirect subsidiary of Wynn Macau, Limited, formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the Macau government for approximately 51 acres of land in the Cotai area of Macau. On May 2, 2012, the land concession contract was gazetted by the government of Macau evidencing the final step in the granting of the land concession.

The initial term of the Cotai land concession contract is 25 years from May 2, 2012, and it may be renewed with government approval for successive periods. The total land premium payable, including interest as required by the land concession contract, is $193.4 million. An initial payment of $62.5 million was paid in December 2011, with eight additional semi-annual payments of approximately $16.4 million each (including interest at 5%), which began in November 2012. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining $16.0 million obligation was recorded as a current liability. We will be required to make 

4 
annual lease payments of $0.8 million during the resort construction period and annual lease payments of approximately $1.1 million once the development is completed.

On July 29, 2013, Wynn Macau SA and Palo executed a guaranteed maximum price construction ("GMP") contract with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, acting as the general contractor. The general contractor is obligated to substantially complete the project in the first half of 2016 for a guaranteed maximum price of HK$20.6 billion (approximately $2.7 billion). On November 18, 2015, we were notified by the general contractor that the Wynn Palace project in the Cotai area of Macau will not be ready to open by the projected early completion date of March 25, 2016. The general contractor has expressed its commitment to the completion of the project by the required date but has advised us that they dispute our assessment of liquidated damages. We continue to expect to open the property in the first half of 2016; however, potential construction delays could push the opening date into the second half of 2016. Both the contract time and guaranteed maximum price are subject to further adjustment under certain specified conditions. The performance of the general contractor is backed by a full completion guarantee given by CIMIC Group Limited (formerly Leighton Holdings Limited), the parent company of the general contractor, as well as a performance bond for 5% of the guaranteed maximum price. 

In November 2014, we were awarded a gaming license to develop and construct an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston. This was the only license granted in the greater Boston region. The resort will be located on a 33-acre site along the Mystic River. The resort will contain a hotel, a waterfront boardwalk, meeting space, a casino, a spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets. We have begun site remediation, site preparation and pre-construction activities. 

We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the United States, and worldwide.

Our Strategy

We believe that Wynn Resorts is the world's preeminent designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts. The Company's integrated resort business model, pioneered by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen A. Wynn, integrates luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting space, and gaming, all supported by superior levels of customer service. Given his extensive design and operational experience across numerous gaming jurisdictions, we believe that Mr. Wynn's involvement with our resorts provides a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises. 

Wynn Resorts and its management team have a demonstrated track record in developing and operating successful integrated resort projects around the world. The senior executive team has an average of over 25 years of experience in the hotel and gaming industries. In addition, we have a 125-person design, development and construction subsidiary, the senior management of which has significant experience across all major construction disciplines.

We aim to build appropriately scaled integrated resorts that attract a wide range of customer segments (including premium international customers), generate strong financial results, and complement their surrounding market areas. We design and continually refresh our integrated resorts to create unique customer experiences across a wide range of gaming and non-gaming amenities. Our business is dependent upon repeat visitation from our guests; we believe superior customer experience and service is the best marketing strategy to attract and retain our customers. We emphasize human resources and staff training to ensure our employees are prepared to provide the luxury service that our guests expect. 

Our integrated resorts are conceptualized, designed, built and operated in major metropolitan markets to service all customers with an emphasis on providing superior levels of premium customer service. In Las Vegas and Macau, we have been successful in attracting not only a wide range of domestic guests, but also extending our customer market areas into international markets. We leverage our international marketing team across branch offices (Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Vancouver, Canada) located in five countries to attract international customers. 

Reflecting our commitment to customer service globally, the Company has received the following recognition:

•Collectively, Wynn Resorts earned more Five-Star awards than any other independent hotel company in the world in the official 2016 Forbes Travel Guide Star Rating list. 

•Wynn Macau | Encore continues to be the only resort in the world with seven Five-Star awards. 

•Wynn Resorts owns two of the largest Forbes Five-Star hotels in the United States: Wynn Tower Suites (Las Vegas) and Encore Tower Suites (Las Vegas).

5 
•Wynn Resorts was once again honored as the highest ranking casino resort on FORTUNE Magazine's 2016 World's Most Admired Companies list in the hotel, casino and resort category. 

We plan to continue to seek out new opportunities to develop and operate integrated resorts, including related businesses, around the world. Overall, we believe Wynn Resorts has a demonstrated track record of developing integrated resorts that stimulate city- and region-wide economic activity, which we believe includes:

•attracting a wide range of customers to the region, including high-net-worth international tourists;

•driving international tourism for the region;

•lifting average hotel room rates in the region;

•extending the average length of stay per visitor;

•complementing existing convention and meeting business with 5-star accommodations and appropriately scaled meeting amenities;

•elevating service levels with the execution of five-star customer service; and

•helping stimulate city-wide investment and employment.

Market and Competition

The casino resort industry is highly competitive. Both our Macau Operations and our Las Vegas Operations compete with other high-quality casino resorts. Resorts located on or near our properties compete on the basis of the range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, themes and size, among other factors. We seek to differentiate our Macau and Las Vegas integrated resorts from other major resorts by delivering superior design and customer service. 

Macau

Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and approximately one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 50 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, with two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, between which the Cotai area is located. In 2002, the government of Macau ended a 40-year monopoly on the conduct of gaming operations by conducting a competitive process that resulted in the issuance of gaming concessions to three concessionaires (including Wynn Macau SA), who in turn were permitted, subject to the approval of the government of Macau, to each grant one subconcession, resulting in a total of six gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. In addition to Wynn Macau SA, each of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau ("SJM") and Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited are primary concessionaires with Sands China Ltd., Melco Crown and MGM China Holdings Limited operating under subconcessions. There is no limit to the number of casinos each concessionaire or subconcessionaire is permitted to operate, but each facility is subject to government approval. Currently, there are 36 operating casinos in Macau.

We believe that Macau is located in one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau, the largest gaming market in the world, generated approximately $29 billion in gaming revenue in 2015. Since the introduction of new casinos starting in 2004, the Macau market has experienced a significant increase in annual gaming revenue from the $2.9 billion generated in 2002; however, the Macau market has recently experienced significant year-over-year declines, including a 34.3% decline in 2015. 

Macau's gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. Tourist arrivals in 2015 were 30.7 million, compared to 31.5 million in 2014. The Macau market has also experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last several years. As of December 31, 2015, there were 32,200 hotel rooms, 5,957 table games and 14,578 slot machines in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms, 2,762 table games and 6,546 slot machines as of December 31, 2006.

Gaming customers traveling to Macau have typically come from nearby destinations in Asia, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 90% of the tourists who visited Macau in 2015 came from Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan. Travel to Macau by citizens of mainland China requires a visa. Chinese government officials have, on occasion, exercised their authority to adjust the visa policy and may do so in the future.

Wynn Macau faces competition primarily from the 35 other casinos located throughout Macau plus casinos located throughout the world, including Singapore, Australia, the Philippines, Las Vegas and cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming.

6 
Las Vegas

Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. Although Las Vegas Strip gaming revenues remained relatively flat at $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in Las Vegas continued to improve with increased visitation and hotel room demand. During 2015, the average daily room rate increased 2.7% and visitation increased 2.9% to 42.3 million visitors compared to 2014. In addition, Las Vegas Strip resorts experienced 2015 year-over-year increases of 0.6% and 3.3% in occupancy and revenue per available room, respectively.

Our Las Vegas Operations are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos in Las Vegas. Our Las Vegas Operations also compete, to some extent, with other casino resorts throughout the United States and elsewhere in the world.

Regulation and Licensing

Macau

General. As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau SA, an indirect 72% owned subsidiary of the Company, is subject to the regulatory control of the government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires or subconcessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Subconcessions may be awarded subject to the approval of the Macau government and each concessionaire has issued one subconcession. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Law and Administrative Regulations, form the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.

Under the Law and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire's equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key employees. Transfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.

Each concessionaire is required to engage an executive director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 10% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the executive director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the management of a concessionaire's casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.

Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 4% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold applicable taxes, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to gaming promoters. The withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.

Concession Agreement. The concession agreement between Wynn Macau SA and the Macau government required Wynn Macau SA to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau, including, at a minimum, one full-service casino resort by the end of December 2006, and to invest not less than a total of 4 billion Macau patacas (approximately $500.0 million) in Macau-related projects by June 2009. These obligations were satisfied upon the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006.

Wynn Macau SA was also obligated to obtain, and did obtain, a 700.0 million Macau pataca (approximately $87.0 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. ("BNU") that was effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this guarantee was reduced to 300 million Macau patacas (approximately $37.0 million) for the period from April 1, 

7 
2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau SA's performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. Wynn Macau SA is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is currently paid an annual fee by Wynn Macau SA for the guarantee of approximately 2.3 million patacas (approximately $0.3 million).

The government of Macau may redeem the concession beginning on June 24, 2017, and in such event Wynn Macau SA will be entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied by the remaining years before expiration of the concession.

The government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession if Wynn Macau SA fails to fulfill its fundamental obligations under the concession agreement. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau SA:

•conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•abandons or suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;

•defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;

•is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or

•repeatedly and seriously violates applicable gaming laws.

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement for one of the reasons stated above, Wynn Macau SA will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino under Macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau SA will be transferred to the government without compensation. In addition, the government of Macau may, in the public interest, unilaterally terminate the concession at any time, in which case Wynn Macau SA would be entitled to reasonable compensation.

The government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. The government of Macau also may redeem a concession starting at an established date after the entering into effect of a concession. 

Gaming Promoters. A gaming promoter, also known as a junket representative, is a person or entity who, for the purpose of promoting casino gaming activity, arranges customer transportation and accommodations, and provides credit in their sole discretion, food and beverage services and entertainment in exchange for commissions or other compensation from a concessionaire. Macau law provides that gaming promoters must be licensed by the Macau government in order to do business with and receive compensation from concessionaires. For a license to be obtained, direct and indirect owners of 5% or more of a gaming promoter (regardless of its corporate form or sole proprietor status), its directors and its key employees must be found suitable. Applicants are required to pay the cost of license investigations, and are required to maintain suitability standards during the period of licensure. The term of a gaming promoter's license is one calendar year, and licenses can be renewed for additional periods upon the submission of renewal applications. Natural person junket representative licensees are subject to a suitability verification process every three years and business entity licensees are subject to the same requirement every six years. The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau ("DICJ") implemented certain instructions in 2009, which have the force of law, relating to commissions paid to, and by, gaming promoters. Such instructions also impose certain financial reporting and audit requirements on gaming promoters.

Under Macau law, licensed gaming promoters must identify outside contractors who assist them in their promotion activities. These contractors are subject to approval of the Macau government. Changes in the management structure of business entity gaming promoters licensees must be reported to the Macau government and any transfer or the encumbering of interests in such licensees is ineffective without prior government approval. To conduct gaming promotion activities licensees must be registered with one or more concessionaires and must have written contracts with such concessionaires, copies of which must be submitted to the Macau government.

Macau law further provides that concessionaires are jointly responsible with their gaming promoters for the gaming activities of such representatives and their directors and contractors in the concessionaire's casinos, and for their compliance 

8 
with applicable laws and regulations. Concessionaires must submit annual lists of their gaming promoters, and must update such lists on a quarterly basis. The Macau government may designate a maximum number of gaming promoters and specify the number of gaming promoters a concessionaire is permitted to engage. Concessionaires are subject to periodic reporting requirements with respect to commissions paid to their gaming promoters' representatives and are required to oversee their activities and report instances of unlawful activity. 

In late 2015, the Macau government implemented enhanced accounting and financial procedures and requirements to be followed by gaming promoters. These enhanced procedures require gaming promoters to disclose more detailed financial and accounting information to the DICJ, including the disclosure of certain financial information on a monthly basis. Gaming promoters also must identify and nominate senior financial or accounting representatives to be available to the DICJ for any follow-up matters the Bureau may require. 

Nevada

Introduction. The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations made thereunder, as well as to various local ordinances. Our Las Vegas Operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which we refer to herein collectively as the "Nevada Gaming Authorities."

Policy Concerns of Gaming Laws. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy. Such public policy concerns include, among other things:

•preventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

•establishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;

•maintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding assets and revenue, providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

•preventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and

•providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.

Changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our Las Vegas gaming operations and our financial condition and results of operations.

Owner and Operator Licensing Requirements. Our subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the owner and operator of our Las Vegas Operations, has been approved by the Nevada Gaming Authorities as a limited liability company licensee, referred to as a company licensee, which includes approval to conduct casino gaming operations, including a race book and sports pool, pari-mutuel wagering and the operation of gaming salons. These gaming licenses are not transferable.

Company Registration Requirements. Wynn Resorts was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC ("Wynn Resorts Holdings"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, referred to as a registered company, for the purposes of the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Wynn Resorts Holdings was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn America, LLC ("Wynn America") and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company. Wynn America was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas Holdings, LLC and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company. Wynn Las Vegas Holdings, LLC was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company. In addition to being licensed, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as an issuer of debt securities registered with the SEC, also qualified as a registered company. Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a co-issuer of the debt securities, was not required to be registered or licensed, but may be required to be found suitable as a lender or financing source.

Periodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and provide any other information that the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Commission.

Individual Licensing Requirements. No person may become a more than 5% stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of the profits of, an intermediary company or company licensee without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material 

9 
relationship to or material involvement with us to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. All applications required as of the date of this report have been filed. However, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason which they deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Commission may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.

Redemption of Securities Owned by an Unsuitable Person. The Company's articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the Board of Directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the Company's or any affiliate's application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of Wynn Resorts' capital stock that are owned or controlled by such person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by Wynn Resorts. The redemption price will be the amount, if any, required by the gaming authority or, if the gaming authority does not determine the price, the sum deemed by the Board of Directors to be the fair value of the securities to be redeemed. If Wynn Resorts determines the redemption price, the redemption price will be capped at the closing price of the shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed on the trading day before the redemption notice is given. If the shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, the redemption price will be capped at the closing sale price of the shares as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or if the closing price is not reported, the mean between the bid and ask prices, as quoted by any other generally recognized reporting system. Wynn Resorts' right of redemption is not exclusive of any other rights that it may have or later acquire under any agreement, its bylaws or otherwise. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by the applicable Gaming Authority and, if not, as the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts elects, and as set forth in the Company's articles of incorporation.

Based on the Board of Directors' finding of "unsuitability," on February 18, 2012, Wynn Resorts redeemed and canceled Aruze USA, Inc.'s ("Aruze") 24,549,222 shares of Wynn Resorts' common stock. Pursuant to its articles of incorporation, Wynn Resorts issued the Redemption Price Promissory Note (the "Redemption Note") to Aruze in redemption of the shares. Aruze, Universal Entertainment Corporation and Mr. Kazuo Okada (collectively, the "Okada Parties") have challenged the redemption of Aruze's shares and the Company is currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. See Item 1A—"Risk Factors" and Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 17 "Commitments and Contingencies." 

Consequences of Violating Gaming Laws. If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that we have violated the Nevada Gaming Control Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Gaming Control Act, or of the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Further, the Nevada Gaming Commission could appoint a supervisor to operate our Las Vegas Operations and, under specified circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor's appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.

Requirements for Voting or Nonvoting Securities Holders. Regardless of the number of shares held, any beneficial owner of Wynn Resorts' voting or nonvoting securities may be required to file an application, be investigated and have that person's suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the beneficial owner of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.

10 
The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of the voting securities of a registered company to report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company's voting securities to apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. However, an "institutional investor," as defined in the Nevada Gaming Control Act, which beneficially owns more than 10% but not more than 11% of a registered company's voting securities as a result of a stock repurchase by the registered company may not be required to file such an application. Further, an institutional investor which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a registered company's voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but not more than 29% of a registered company's voting securities and maintain its waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by the registered company. An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Nevada Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;

•making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in management, policies or operations; and

•other activities that the Nevada Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

The articles of incorporation of Wynn Resorts include provisions intended to assist its implementation of the above restrictions.

Wynn Resorts is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of Wynn Resorts' voting securities. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts' common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts' articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.

Consequences of Being Found Unsuitable. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or by the Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with the investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:

•pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;

•allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;

•pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

•fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person's voting securities, including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

Gaming Laws Relating to Debt Securities Ownership. The Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other securities of the registered company if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the Nevada Gaming 

11 
Commission decides that a person is unsuitable to own the securities, then under the Nevada Gaming Control Act, the registered company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, it:

•pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;

•recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;

•pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or

•makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.

Approval of Public Offerings. Wynn Resorts and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC may not make a public offering (debt or equity) without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On March 21, 2013, the Nevada Gaming Commission granted us and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of three years (the "Shelf Approval"). We are currently in the process of obtaining a renewal for approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Shelf Approval also applies to any affiliated company wholly owned by us that is a publicly traded corporation or would thereby become a publicly traded corporation pursuant to a public offering. The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by any of the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the offering memorandum or the investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. 

Approval of Changes in Control. A registered company must obtain the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission with respect to a change in control through merger; consolidation; stock or asset acquisitions; management or consulting agreements; or any act or conduct by a person by which the person obtains control of the registered company.

Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered company must satisfy the Nevada Gaming Control Board and Nevada Gaming Commission with respect to a variety of stringent standards before assuming control of the registered company. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

Approval of Defensive Tactics. The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada corporate gaming licensees or affecting registered companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy in order to:

•assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies;

•preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

•promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before a registered company can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above its current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company's Board of Directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.

Fees and Taxes. License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries' respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon:

•a percentage of the gross revenue received;

•the number of gaming devices operated; or

•the number of table games operated.

A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges where live entertainment is furnished.

12 
Foreign Gaming Investigations. Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered in Nevada, or is under common control with such persons (collectively, "licensees"), and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board of the licensee's or registrant's participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees and registrants are required to comply with the foreign gaming reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if it:

•knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

•fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

•engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or

•employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.

Licenses for Conduct of Gaming and Sale of Alcoholic Beverages. The conduct of gaming activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas, LLC licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license. Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact upon our operations.

Massachusetts

Introduction. On November 22, 2011, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick signed Chapter 194 of the Acts of 2011 "An Act Establishing Expanded Gaming in the Commonwealth," legislation (the "Gaming Act") designed to provide significant benefits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by advancing job creation and economic development. The Gaming Act allows for up to three destination resort casinos located in three geographically diverse regions across the Commonwealth and a single slots facility, not pegged to any particular region. The licensing fee for each resort casino is $85.0 million and requires a capital investment, to include a hotel facility, of at least $500.0 million. The Commonwealth will receive 25% of gross gaming revenues. 

The Gaming Act also called for the creation of a five-member independent body, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (the "MGC"), to oversee the implementation and licensing process, as well as regulate the operation of gaming facilities. The MGC is in the process of promulgating detailed regulations to govern the operations of the resort casinos and the slot parlor facility. The slot facility, located in Plainville, MA, opened in June 2015. 

Owner and Operator Licensing Requirements. Our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Wynn MA, LLC, was the "applicant" under the MGC's Phase 1 regulations and was determined to be suitable for the purpose of holding a Category 1 Gaming License. On September 17, 2014, the MGC designated Wynn MA, LLC the award winner of the Greater Boston (Region A) gaming license. On November 7, 2014, the gaming license awarded to us became effective. 

Company Registration Requirements. In addition, pursuant to the Phase 1 regulations, the following entities and persons are deemed to be "qualifiers" subject to investigation: all members, transferees of a member's interest, directors and managers of the licensee and, in the judgment of the MGC, each lender, each holder of indebtedness, each underwriter, each close associate, each executive and each agent. As a result, Wynn Resorts, its key employees and its directors were therefore subject to a suitability investigation. Wynn Resorts and all individual qualifiers were found suitable by the MGC. As our progress in Massachusetts continues, additional entities and key employees may be required to file applications with the MGC and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the MGC. Following Wynn America, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited, entering into a senior secured credit facility in November 2014, the MGC has requested additional applications, which are pending. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a 

13 
finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the MGC.

If the MGC were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the MGC may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review.

Consequences of Violating Gaming Laws. If the MGC determines that we have violated the Gaming Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, the MGC set forth certain conditions in our gaming license. Any violation of the Gaming Act, its regulations or any of our license conditions resulting in a limitation, conditioning or suspension of our gaming license would have a significant negative effect on our Massachusetts gaming operations.

Licenses for Conduct of Gaming and Sale of Alcoholic Beverages. Pursuant to the Gaming Act, the MGC may grant a gaming beverage license for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages for a gaming establishment. The division of gaming liquor enforcement of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission will have the authority to enforce, regulate and control the distribution of alcoholic beverages in a gaming establishment. The MGC may revoke, suspend, refuse to renew or refuse to transfer a gaming beverage license for violations of the Gaming Act that pertain to the sale and distribution of alcohol consumed on the premises and the regulations adopted by the MGC. The MGC is in the process of adopting regulations for the issuance of gaming beverage licenses. These regulations and any changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our future Massachusetts gaming operations and results of operations.

Other Regulations

In addition to gaming regulations, we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employment and immigration, currency and other transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, marketing and advertising, lending, debt collection, privacy, telemarketing, money laundering, laws and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Seasonality

We may experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month; however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 20,800 total employees (including approximately 8,900 in Macau and 11,900 in Las Vegas).

Our ten-year collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary and Bartenders Union, which covers approximately 5,590 employees at our Las Vegas Operations, was set to expire in July 2015. We have signed an extension of the agreement and are currently negotiating a new agreement. In November 2010, we entered into a ten-year collective bargaining agreement with the Transportation Workers Union, which covers 444 table games dealers at our Las Vegas Operations. Certain other unions may seek to organize the workers of our resorts. 

Intellectual Property

Among our most important marks are our trademarks and service marks that use the name "WYNN." Wynn Resorts has registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") a variety of the WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. 

We have also filed applications with various foreign patent and trademark registries, including in Macau, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. 

14 
We recognize that our intellectual property assets, including the word and logo version of "WYNN," are among our most valuable assets. As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our trademarks and other intellectual property rights in relevant jurisdictions. We have retained counsel and intend to take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world.

On August 6, 2004, we entered into agreements with Mr. Wynn that confirm and clarify our rights to use the "Wynn" surname and Mr. Wynn's persona in connection with our casino resorts. Under a Surname Rights Agreement, Mr. Wynn has acknowledged our exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide right to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating, the "Wynn" surname for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to our affiliates. Under a Rights of Publicity License, Mr. Wynn has granted us the exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to use his full name, persona and related rights of publicity for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the ability to sublicense the persona and publicity rights to our affiliates, until October 24, 2017.

We have also registered various domain names with various domain registrars around the world. Our domain registrations extend to various foreign countries such as ".com.cn" and ".com.hk." We pursue domain related infringement on a case by case basis depending on the infringing domain in question. The information found on these websites is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file or furnish to the SEC.

For more information regarding the Company's intellectual property matters see Item 1A—"Risk Factors".
