 Item 1. Business  

Separation from The E. W. Scripps Company  

As previously disclosed in our registration statement on Form 10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. was formed on July 1, 2008 and became a publicly traded company as the result of the separation of The E. W. Scripps Company (our Former Parent or E. W. Scripps) into two publicly traded companies. The separation was completed through a tax free distribution of Scripps Networks Interactive shares to E. W. Scripps shareholders following the close of business on June 30, 2008.  

Business Overview  

Scripps Networks Interactive is a leading lifestyle content and interactive services company with respected, high-profile television and interactive brands. Our businesses engage audiences and efficiently serve advertisers by delivering entertaining and highly useful content that focuses on specifically defined topics of interest.  

We manage our operations through two reportable operating segments: Lifestyle Media and Interactive Services. We also have businesses with operations in international markets. Lifestyle Media includes our national television networks, Home and Garden Television (HGTV), Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network (DIY), Cooking Channel and Great American Country (GAC). Lifestyle Media also includes Web sites that are associated with the aforementioned television brands and other Internet-based businesses, such as HGTVPro.com and FrontDoor.com, serving food, home and travel related categories. Interactive Services includes our online comparison shopping service, Shopzilla, and its related online comparison shopping brands, BizRate, Beso and Tada.  

Our Lifestyle Media segment earns revenue principally from advertising sales, affiliate fees and ancillary sales, including the sale and licensing of consumer products. Revenues from the Interactive Services segment are generated primarily from referral fees and advertising paid by participating online retailers. Revenues from the Lifestyle Media segment accounted for 90 percent, 89 percent and 85 percent of our consolidated revenues for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and revenues from the Interactive Services segment accounted for 9 percent, 11 percent and 15 percent of our consolidated revenues for those periods, respectively. Revenues from our international businesses accounted for one percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010.  

We seek to engage audiences that are highly desirable to advertisers with entertaining and informative lifestyle content that is produced for television, the Internet and any other media platforms consumers choose. We intend to expand and enhance our Lifestyle Media brands through the creation of popular new programming and content, the use of new distribution platforms, such as mobile phones and video-on-demand,

 the licensing and sale of branded consumer products and through international expansion. At our Interactive Services businesses, we aggregate large audiences on the Internet by organizing searchable and highly useful consumer information. We intend to enhance our Interactive Services businesses by improving the overall search comprehensiveness and usefulness of our Web sites, diversifying sources of revenue, increasing the volume of user-generated consumer information and entering new geographic markets.  

Business Segments  

Lifestyle Media  

Our Lifestyle Media business segment includes six national television networks and our portfolio of related interactive lifestyle brands. The segment generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising time on national television networks and interactive media platforms and from affiliate fees paid by cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite services and other distributors that carry our network programming. In 2010, revenues from advertising sales and affiliate fees were approximately 69 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total revenue for the Lifestyle Media segment. Our Lifestyle Media segment also earns revenue from the licensing of its content to third parties and the licensing of its brands for consumer products such as videos, books, kitchenware and tools.  

The advertising revenue generated by our national television networks depends on the number of households subscribing to each service and on viewership ratings as determined by Nielsen Media Research and other third-party research companies.  

HGTV, Food Network, and Cooking Channel and their targeted home and food programming categories appeal strongly to women viewers with higher incomes in the 18 to 49 age range, an audience demographic that is traditionally valued by advertisers. Travel Channel and its targeted travel programming categories appeal to viewers who are more affluent than the average cable viewer and skews slightly to adult men in the 18 to 49 range. GAC appeals to women viewers, while DIY typically has a higher percentage of adult male viewers. Advertising revenue can fluctuate relative to the popularity of specific programs and blocks of programming during defined periods of the day.  

Affiliate fee revenues are negotiated with individual cable television and direct-to-home satellite operators and other distributors. The negotiations typically result in multi-year carriage agreements with scheduled, graduated rate increases. As an incentive to obtain long-term distribution agreements for our newer networks, we may make cash payments to cable and direct-to-home satellite operators, provide an initial period during which a distributors affiliate fee payments are waived, or both. The amount of the fee we receive is determined by the number of subscribers with access to our network programming.  

Programming expense, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are the primary operating costs of our Lifestyle Media segment. Program amortization represented 41 percent of Lifestyle Media expenses in 2010 reflecting our continued investment in the improved quality and variety programming at our networks. We incur sales and marketing expenses to support brand-building initiatives at all of the Companys television networks.  

As consumer acceptance of high-definition television grows, the Company is developing an increasing amount of original programming in high-definition format. Lifestyle Media operates five high-definition channels, HGTV-HD, Food Network-HD, Travel Channel-HD, DIY-HD and Cooking Channel-HD. The Companys high-definition television networks are accessible by an estimated 40 million U.S. households.  

The Companys lifestyle-oriented interactive businesses are focused on the internal development and acquisition of interactive media brands that are intended to diversify sources of revenue and enhance our competitive advantage as a leading provider of food, home, travel and lifestyle content. Revenue generated by our lifestyle interactive businesses is derived primarily from the sale of display, banner, rich media and video advertising and sponsorships.  

The lifestyle-oriented interactive businesses consist of multiple Web sites, including our six network-branded Web sites, FoodNetwork.com, HGTV.com, TravelChannel.com, DIYNetwork.com, CookingChanneltv.com and GACTV.com. In addition to serving as the home Web sites for the segments television programming networks, the Web sites provide informational and instructional content on specific topics within their broader lifestyle content categories. Features such as HGTV KitchenDesign, HGTV BathDesign, and DIY Home Improvement are intended to aggregate engaged audiences with interests in specific lifestyle topics. All of the segments interactive businesses benefit from archived television network programming of which approximately 95 percent is owned by the Company. Our ownership of programming enables us to efficiently and economically repurpose it for use on the Internet and other interactive distribution channels, including mobile and video-on-demand.  

The lifestyle Web sites also consist of other digital services including HGTVPro.com, which appeals to construction professionals and advanced do-it-yourself enthusiasts; Food.com (formerly Recipezaar.com), a recipe-sharing social networking Web site; and FrontDoor.com, a local real estate search and consumer information site that features millions of home listings and thousands of videos. The lifestyle Web sites accounted for about 5 percent of the segments total revenue in 2010. The strategic focus of the lifestyle interactive businesses is to grow advertising and sponsorship revenues by increasing the number of page views and video plays and attracting more unique visitors to our Web sites through site enhancements, adding more video, new tools, etc. Our strategy also includes attracting a broader audience through the placement of our video programming on national video streaming sites, and developing new sources of revenue that capitalize on traffic growth at our Web sites.

Table of Contents 

The Interactive Services segment derives the largest percentage of its revenue from direct referral fees paid and advertising paid by participating online merchants that enter into contractual agreements allowing them to place text-based, linked advertisements on the segments Web sites. The referral fees paid by advertisers are based on a cost-per-click pricing structure, which means that advertisers pay only when consumers click on their linked ads. Cost-per-click pricing provides advertisers with an efficient means of evaluating the effectiveness of their advertising. Of particular importance for advertisers is the number of sales resulting from users clicking on their linked advertising. The segments search businesses encourage sustained advertising relationships with merchants by demonstrating a measurable return on investment for the referral fees they pay.  

The advertising links placed by merchants serve as the primary database of information for the segments Web sites. Because the success of our Interactive Services businesses depends largely on a quality user experience and repeated visits by users, ad links are intentionally presented in an unobtrusive and uniform format that provides users with impartial and factual information on products.  

The Interactive Services segment also derives revenue from contractual advertising agreements with general search engines. The agreements allow the general search engines to leverage relationships with their respective advertisers by placing sponsored links on our Interactive Services Web sites. Similar to our direct advertising relationships with merchants and service providers, the general search engines pay referral fees on a cost-per-click basis.  

Revenue categories as a percentage of total Interactive Services segment revenue are as follows:  

       Direct referral fees from advertising merchants, 57 percent in 2010 vs. 60 percent in 2009.  

       Sponsored link referral fees from general search engines, 32 percent in 2010 vs. 30 percent in 2009.  

The Interactive Services segment measures operating performance in terms of net revenue, which is defined as total revenue minus traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs are those marketing expenses related to generating user traffic to the segments Web sites. The success of the segments businesses is largely dependent on the ability to efficiently and economically attract a high volume of user traffic.  

The segments businesses use a combination of online and off-line strategies to increase consumer awareness and subsequently generate user traffic. They include:  

       Search Engine Marketing. Search Engine Marketing refers to the purchase of text-based advertising links on general search engines such as Google and Yahoo!. The positioning and display of those paid advertising links is dependent on the acquisition of relevant keywords that determine the quality and effectiveness of general search results. The segments businesses participate in continuous keyword bidding auctions that are hosted by general search engines with the objective of acquiring keywords that result in the most advantageous positioning and display of purchased advertising links adjacent to general search results.  

       Search Engine Optimization. Search Engine Optimization refers to the continuous, algorithmic selection of relevant keywords that, when used by general search engine users, result in the most advantageous positioning and display of links to the segments Web sites within general search results. Traffic generated by Search Engine Optimization generally results in higher net revenues for the segments businesses than traffic generated by Search Engine Marketing.  

       Offline advertising and marketing techniques, which refers to the purchase of television, newspaper, magazine, and other more traditional forms of advertising, and the execution of effective public relations campaigns to increase brand awareness for the segments businesses.  

International  

The Company also is executing its growth strategy internationally. The Company, through equity ownership positions in joint ventures and other partnerships, seeks to become a world leader in lifestyle media and brand-related products and services. The Company initiated its international strategy with the launch of Food Network on B-Sky-B in the United Kingdom, reaching 10 million households. The Food Networks distribution in the U.K., other European markets, the Middle East and Africa is supported by a joint venture the Company entered into and controls with Liberty Global Inc.s Chello Zone. The Company is considering entering or creating partnerships in other international markets including the Asia-Pacific, India and Latin America.  

Our international businesses earn revenues primarily from advertising sales, affiliate fees, and the licensing of programming to third parties. Programming expense, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are the primary operating costs of our international businesses.

Competition  

Cable and satellite network programming is a highly competitive business in the U.S. and worldwide. Our cable and satellite networks and Web sites generally compete for advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television networks, online and mobile outlets, radio programming and print media. Our networks and Web sites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast networks, local over-the-air television stations, competitors pay and basic cable television networks, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services, online activities and other forms of news, information and entertainment. Our networks also compete with other television networks for distribution and affiliate fees derived from distribution agreements with cable television operators, satellite operators and other distributors.  

Our Interactive Services business competes for both consumer and merchant users of our service. We compete for consumers on the basis of brand recognition, coverage of products and merchants, quality of information and ease of use. We compete for merchants on the basis of the quantity of lead referrals and our ability to help merchants measure the results of their marketing expenditures on our services. Any service that helps consumers find, compare or buy products is a competitor to us.  

Employees  

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 2,000 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 1,600 were with Lifestyle Media.
