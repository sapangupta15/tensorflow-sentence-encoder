Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

 Corporate Profile and Significant Developments  

 M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $65.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.).  

 M&T Bank, with total assets of $64.8 billion at December 31, 2008, is a New York-chartered commercial bank with 684 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in their markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although residential and commercial real estate loans are originated through lending offices in six other states. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a  

 29   
 multifamily commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency.  

 M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $939 million at December 31, 2008, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone, Internet and direct mail marketing techniques.  

 On December 18, 2008, M&T entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Provident Bankshares Corporation (Provident), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident will merge with and into First Empire State Holding Company, a wholly owned direct subsidiary of M&T formed solely for the purposes of the merger. Immediately following the acquisition, Providents wholly owned banking subsidiary, Provident Bank of Maryland (Provident Bank) will be merged with and into M&T Bank. Provident Bank operates 143 branch offices located primarily in Maryland and Virginia. At December 31, 2008, Provident had $6.6 billion in assets, including $4.4 billion of loans and leases and $1.4 billion of investment securities, and $5.9 billion of liabilities, including $4.8 billion of deposits. The merger requires the approval of various regulatory agencies and Providents shareholders and, assuming those approvals are obtained, is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2009. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Provident common shareholders will receive 0.171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Provident common stock they own. Provident Series A and Series B preferred stock will be exchanged for series of M&T preferred stock on substantially the same terms. The acquisition of Provident will expand the Companys presence in the Mid-Atlantic area, is expected to give the Company the second-largest deposit share in Maryland, and will triple the Companys presence in Virginia.  

 The condition of the residential real estate marketplace and the U.S. economy in 2007 and 2008 has had a significant impact on the financial services industry as a whole, and specifically on the financial results of the Company. Beginning with a pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market in early 2007 that was led by problems in the sub-prime mortgage market, the deterioration of residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and charge-offs of loans continued throughout 2008. The drop in real estate values negatively impacted residential real estate builder and developer businesses. With the U.S. economy in recession in 2008, financial institutions were facing higher credit losses from distressed real estate values and borrower defaults, resulting in reduced capital levels. In addition, investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate were reflecting substantial unrealized losses due to a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Some financial institutions were forced into liquidation or were merged with stronger institutions as losses increased and the amounts of available funding and capital levels lessened. The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), two government-sponsored entities, were placed in conservatorship in September 2008 by the U.S. Government. The Federal Reserve also lowered its federal funds target rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 three times, from 2.00% at the beginning of the quarter to a range of 0% - .25% at December 31, 2008.  

 In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department (U.S. Treasury) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) initiated measures to stabilize the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was signed into law on October 3, 2008 and authorizes the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be used to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system. Under the authority of EESA, the U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase program to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury has been purchasing senior preferred shares of financial institutions which will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for five years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The terms of the senior preferred shares indicate that the shares may not be redeemed for three years except with the proceeds of a qualifying equity offering and that after three years, the shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In February 2009, legislation was signed that may result in changes in those terms. The senior preferred shares are non-voting and qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting purposes. In  

 30   
 connection with purchasing senior preferred shares, the U.S. Treasury also receives warrants to purchase the common stock of participating financial institutions having a market price of 15% of the amount of senior preferred shares on the date of investment with an exercise price equal to the market price of the participating institutions common stock at the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The warrants have a term of ten years and are immediately exercisable, in whole or in part. For a period of three years, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for participating institutions to increase their common stock dividend or repurchase their common stock, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice. Participation in the capital purchase program also includes certain restrictions on executive compensation. The minimum subscription amount available to a participating institution is one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The maximum suggested subscription amount is three percent of risk-weighted assets. On December 23, 2008, M&T issued to the U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A preferred stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares of M&T common stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected to participate in the capital purchase program at an amount equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the time.  

 Following a systemic risk determination pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC announced a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which temporarily guarantees the senior debt of all FDIC-insured institutions and certain holding companies, as well as deposits in noninterest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, for those institutions and holding companies who did not elect to opt out of the TLGP by December 5, 2008. M&T chose to continue its participation in the TLGP and, thus, did not opt out. To further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors of the economy, the Federal Reserve Board announced a Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) program, which provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market. Beginning October 27, 2008, the CPFF began funding purchases of commercial paper of three-month maturity from high-quality issuers.  

 On November 30, 2007, M&T acquired Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. (Partners Trust), a bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New York. Partners Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary of Partners Trust, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Partners Trust Bank operated 33 branch offices in upstate New York at the date of acquisition. The results of operations acquired in the Partners Trust transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since November 30, 2007, but did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations in 2007 or in 2008. After application of the election, allocation and proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for Partners Trust shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger agreement, M&T paid $9 million in cash to holders of outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Partners Trust. The purchase price was approximately $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged, and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options. The acquisition of Partners Trust expanded the Companys presence in upstate New York, making M&T Bank the deposit market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets, while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.  

 Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007 totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans), liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and time deposits), and $277 million was added to stockholders equity. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $283 million of goodwill and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over 7 years using an accelerated method.  

 As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three of the acquired branch offices in Binghamton, New York. The three branches were sold on March 15, 2008, including loans of $13 million and deposits of $65 million. No gain or loss was recognized on that transaction.  

 On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired the Mid-Atlantic retail banking franchise of First Horizon Bank (First Horizon), a subsidiary of First Horizon National Corporation, in a cash transaction, including $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and $80 million of trust and investment assets under management. The transaction did not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations during 2007 or 2008. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded  

 31   
 approximately $15 million of core deposit and other intangible assets that are being amortized using accelerated methods over a weighted-average life of 7 years.  

 The Company incurred merger-related expenses associated with the Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income taxes, or $.08 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2007 and $4 million ($2 million net of applicable income taxes, or $.02 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2008. Those expenses consisted largely of professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; costs related to branch and office consolidations; incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to customers of the acquired operations; travel costs; printing, postage and supplies; and other costs of commencing operations in new offices. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Partners Trust acquisition were charges totaling $14 million, net of applicable income taxes ($18 million before tax effect), for severance costs for former Partners Trust employees, termination of Partners Trust contracts for various services and other items. As of December 31, 2008, there were no significant amounts of unpaid merger-related expenses or charges included in the determination of goodwill.  

 On February 5, 2007, M&T invested $300 million to acquire a 20 percent minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC (BLG), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender that specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans. M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of accounting. M&Ts pro-rata portion of the results of operations of BLG was a loss of $37 million ($23 million after tax effect) in 2008 and income of $9 million ($5 million after tax effect) in 2007, which have been recorded as a component of other income in the consolidated statement of income. Including expenses associated with M&Ts investment in BLG, most notably interest expense, that investment reduced the Companys net income in 2008 by $32 million (after tax effect) or $.29 per diluted common share and in 2007 by $4 million (after tax effect) or $.04 per diluted common share.  

 On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million of loans, mostly to consumers, small businesses and middle market customers, and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits. Expenses associated with integrating the acquired branches into M&T Bank and introducing the customers associated with those branches to M&T Banks products and services aggregated $3 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per common share during the year ended December 31, 2006.  

 Critical Accounting Estimates  

 The Companys significant accounting policies conform with GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:  

       Allowance for credit losses  The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in    

 32   
      changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses.    

       Valuation methodologies  Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, and other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations; capitalized servicing assets; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; value ascribed to stock-based compensation; estimated residual values of property associated with leases; and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include investment securities, other investments, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.   

       Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements  Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding the Companys income taxes is presented in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.    

 Overview  

 The Companys net income for 2008 was $556 million or $5.01 of diluted earnings per common share, representing declines of 15% and 16%, respectively, from $654 million or $5.95 of diluted earnings per common share in 2007. Basic earnings per common share decreased 17% to $5.04 in 2008 from $6.05 in 2007. Net income in 2006 aggregated $839 million, while diluted and basic earnings per common share were $7.37 and $7.55, respectively. The after-tax impact of acquisition and integration-related expenses (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated with the 2007 business combination and branch acquisition transactions were $2 million ($4 million pre-tax) or $.02 of basic and diluted earnings per  

 33   
 common share in 2008 and $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2007. Similar costs related to the 2006 branch acquisition transaction were $3 million ($5 million pre-tax) or $.03 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2006. Net income represented a rate of return on average assets in 2008 of .85%, compared with 1.12% in 2007 and 1.50% in 2006. The return on average common stockholders equity was 8.64% in 2008, 10.47% in 2007 and 13.89% in 2006.  

 The Companys financial results for 2008 were affected by several notable factors. Largely the result of the state of the U.S. economy and the distressed residential real estate marketplace, the Companys provision for credit losses in 2008 was $412 million, significantly higher than $192 million in 2007. Net charge-offs of loans rose dramatically in 2008, to $383 million from $114 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .78% and .26% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. While charge-offs were up in all major categories of loans, the most significant contributors to the sharp rise were loan charge-offs related to residential real estate markets; charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate jumped from $4 million in 2007 to $100 million in 2008, and residential real estate loan charge-offs grew to $63 million in 2008 from $19 million in 2007. Not only did the condition of the residential real estate markets negatively impact the Companys financial results in 2008 through a higher provision for credit losses, but significantly higher costs were incurred related to the workout process for modifying the residential mortgage loans of creditworthy borrowers and to the foreclosure process for borrowers unable to make payments on their loans.  

 During the third quarter, a $153 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment charge was recorded related to preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The write-down was taken on preferred stock with a basis of $162 million following the U.S. Governments placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7, 2008. At December 31, 2008 the fair value of the securities of $2 million (adjusted cost basis of $9 million) was reflected in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The Company recognized additional other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2008 totaling $29 million (pre-tax) related to certain collateralized debt obligations (obtained from Partners Trust) and collateralized mortgage obligations. In total, other-than-temporary impairment charges on investment securities aggregated $182 million ($111 million after tax effect) during 2008, thereby lowering diluted earnings per common share by $1.00.  

 Also reflected in the Companys 2008 results was $29 million, or $.26 of diluted earnings per common share, resulting from M&T Banks status as a member bank of Visa. During the last quarter of 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2008. As part of that reorganization M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of Class B common stock of Visa. Those banks are also obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation involving Visa (Covered Litigation). As of December 31, 2007, although Visa was expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the Covered Litigation, guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated that Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of the Companys proportionate share of any potential losses related to the Covered Litigation was extremely difficult and involved a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted common share) related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in Visa as of the 2007 year-end. During the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO and, as part of the transaction, funded an escrow account with $3 billion from the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential settlements arising out of the Covered Litigation. As a result, during the first three months of 2008, the Company reversed approximately $15 million of the $23 million accrued during the fourth quarter of 2007 for the Covered Litigation, adding $9 million to net income ($.08 per diluted common share). In addition, M&T Bank was allocated 1,967,028 Class B common shares of Visa based on its proportionate ownership of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were mandatorily redeemed in March 2008 for an after-tax gain of $20 million ($33 million pre-tax), which has been recorded as gain on bank investment securities in the consolidated statement of income, adding $.18 to diluted earnings per common share. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Visa  

 34   
 announced that it had settled an additional portion of the Covered Litigation and it further funded the escrow account to provide for that settlement. That settlement and subsequent funding of the escrow account did not result in a material impact to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  

 The Company resolved certain tax issues during the third quarter of 2008 related to its activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007. As a result, the Company paid $40 million to settle those issues, but was able to reduce previously accrued income tax expense in 2008 by $40 million, thereby adding $.36 to diluted earnings per common share.  

 The Companys financial results for 2007 were adversely impacted by several events. Turmoil in the residential real estate market, which began in early 2007, significantly affected the Companys financial results in a number of ways. Problems experienced by lenders in the sub-prime residential mortgage lending market also had negative repercussions on the rest of the residential real estate marketplace. Through early 2007, the Company had been an active participant in the origination of alternative (Alt-A) residential real estate loans and the sale of such loans in the secondary market. Alt-A loans originated by M&T typically included some form of limited documentation requirements as compared with more traditional residential real estate loans. Unfavorable market conditions during the first quarter of 2007, including a lack of liquidity, impacted the Companys willingness to sell Alt-A loans, as an auction of such loans initiated by the Company received fewer bids than normal and the pricing of those bids was substantially lower than expected. As a result, $883 million of Alt-A loans previously held for sale (including $808 million of first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage loans) were transferred in March 2007 to the Companys held-for-investment loan portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale must be recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the Alt-A mortgage loans to the held-for-investment portfolio, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by $12 million ($7 million after tax effect, or $.07 of diluted earnings per common share). Those loans were reclassified because management believed at that time that the value of the Alt-A residential real estate loans was greater than the amount implied by the few bidders who were active in the market. The downturn in the residential real estate market, specifically related to declining real estate valuations and higher delinquencies, continued throughout the remainder of 2007 and had a negative effect on the majority of financial institutions active in residential real estate lending. Margins earned by the Company from sales of residential real estate loans in the secondary market were lower in 2007 than in 2006.  

 The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase some previously sold residential real estate loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria, including instances where mortgagors fail to make timely payments during the first 90 days subsequent to the sale date. Requests from investors for the Company to repurchase residential real estate loans increased significantly in early 2007, particularly related to Alt-A loans. As a result, during 2007s first quarter the Company reduced mortgage banking revenues by $6 million ($4 million after tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per common share) related to declines in market values of previously sold residential real estate loans that the Company may be required to repurchase.  

 The Company had $1.2 billion of Alt-A residential real estate loans in its held-for-investment loan portfolio at December 31, 2007. Lower real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs contributed to increased losses in that portfolio during 2007, which led to an assessment of the Companys accounting practices during the fourth quarter as they related to the timing of the classification of residential real estate loans as nonaccrual and when such loans were charged off. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, residential real estate loans were classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest payments became 90 days delinquent. Previously, residential real estate loans had been placed in nonaccrual status when payments were 180 days past due. Also in 2007s final quarter, the Company began charging-off loan balances over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan when such loans become 150 days delinquent, whereas previously the Company provided an allowance for credit losses for those amounts and charged-off loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property. The impact of the acceleration of the classification of residential real estate loans as nonaccrual resulted in an increase in nonperforming loans of $84 million at December 31, 2007 and a corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and accruing interest. As a result of that acceleration, previously accrued  

 35   
 interest of $2 million was reversed and charged against income. Included in the $114 million of net charge-offs for 2007 were $15 million resulting from the change in accounting procedure. The declining residential real estate values also contributed to specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses related to two residential real estate builders and developers during the fourth quarter of 2007. Considering these and other factors as discussed herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses, the Company significantly increased the provision for credit losses in 2007 to $192 million, compared with $80 million in 2006.  

 The turbulence in the residential real estate market in 2007 also negatively affected the Companys investment securities portfolio. Three collateralized debt obligations were purchased in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately $132 million. The securities are backed largely by residential mortgage-backed securities (collateralized by a mix of prime, mid-prime and sub-prime residential mortgage loans) and are held in the Companys available-for-sale portfolio. Although these securities were highly rated when purchased, two of the three securities were downgraded by the rating agencies in late-2007. After a thorough analysis, management concluded that the impairment of the market value of these securities was other than temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $127 million ($78 million after tax effect, or $.71 of diluted earnings per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2007. The impairment charge reduced the Companys exposure to collateralized debt obligations backed by residential mortgage securities to approximately $4 million.  

 Finally, as already noted, during the last quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted common share) related to the Visa Covered Litigation.  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis in 2008 rose 5% to $1.96 billion from $1.87 billion in 2007. The positive impact of higher average earning assets was partially offset by a decline in net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Average earning assets increased 12% to $58.0 billion in 2008 from $52.0 billion in 2007, the result of increased average balances of loans and leases and investment securities. Earning assets obtained in the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition transactions were $3.3 billion. Average loans and leases of $48.8 billion in 2008 were $4.7 billion or 11% higher than $44.1 billion in 2007, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $1.6 billion, or 13%, commercial real estate loans of $2.7 billion, or 17%, and consumer loans and leases of $961 million, or 9%, partially offset by a $550 million, or 9%, decline in consumer real estate loans. Reflected in those amounts were loans obtained in the 2007 acquisition transactions aggregating $2.4 billion at the respective acquisition dates, including $259 million of commercial loans and leases, $343 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans and $690 million of consumer loans. Of the $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans acquired, approximately $950 million were securitized into Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities in December 2007. The acquired loans did not have a significant impact on average loans and leases for 2007. Average balances of investment securities increased 23% to $9.0 billion in 2008 from $7.3 billion in 2007. The net interest margin declined 22 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007, largely due to a decrease in the contribution ascribed to net interest-free funds that resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such funds.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2007 was 2% higher than $1.84 billion in 2006. The impact of higher average earning asset balances was largely offset by a decline in net interest margin. Average earning assets increased 5% to $52.0 billion in 2007 from $49.7 billion in 2006 due to higher loan and lease balances, partially offset by lower average balances of investment securities. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2007 rose $2.7 billion or 7% to $44.1 billion from $41.4 billion in 2006, the result of growth in commercial loans and leases of $858 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of $653 million, or 4%, consumer real estate loans of $1.0 billion, or 20%, and consumer loans and leases of $186 million, or 2%. The $2.4 billion of loans obtained in the 2007 acquisition transactions did not have a significant impact on average loans and leases for 2007. The average balance of investment securities outstanding declined $717 million, or 9%, to $7.3 billion in 2007 from $8.0 billion in 2006 due largely to net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and U.S. federal agency securities. The Companys net interest margin narrowed 10 basis points to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in 2006. That narrowing was the result of several factors, including higher rates paid  

 36   
 on deposit accounts and variable-rate borrowings that were only partially offset by higher yields earned on loans and investment securities.  

 The provision for credit losses rose to $412 million in 2008 from $192 million in 2007 and $80 million in 2006. Deteriorating credit conditions that were reflected in rising levels of charge-offs and delinquencies, as well as rapidly declining residential real estate valuations during 2007 and continuing in 2008 and their impact on the Companys portfolios of residential mortgage loans and loans to residential builders and developers, contributed significantly to the increases in the provision. Also contributing to the higher levels of the provision, charge-offs and delinquencies in 2008 was the impact of the condition of the U.S. economy, which was in recession. The level of the provision during 2006 was reflective of generally favorable credit quality. Net charge-offs were $383 million in 2008, up from $114 million in 2007 and $68 million in 2006. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding rose to .78% in 2008 from .26% in 2007 and .16% in 2006. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.  

 Noninterest income in 2008 aggregated $939 million, compared with $933 million in 2007. Reflected in 2008s total were $148 million of losses from bank investment securities, compared with $126 million of such losses in the 2007 noninterest income amount. Those losses were due predominately to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of M&Ts collateralized debt obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The 2008 losses are net of the already noted $33 million gain from the sale of shares of Visa. Excluding the impact of those net securities losses, noninterest income was $1.09 billion in 2008, 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. That 3% rise reflected higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for providing deposit services that were partially offset by a $46 million decline in M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG.  

 Noninterest income in 2007 declined 11% from $1.05 billion in 2006. That decline resulted from the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 related to collateralized debt obligations held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. That charge is reflected in losses from bank investment securities in the consolidated statement of income. Excluding securities gains or losses, noninterest income in 2007 was 1% higher than in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains, and $9 million related to M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG, were largely offset by a $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues. Contributing to the decline in mortgage banking revenues were changing market conditions, which led to slimmer margins realized on sales of residential real estate loans. In addition, the Company recognized $18 million of losses in the first quarter of 2007 related to its Alt-A loan portfolio due to declines in the market values of such loans. Included in noninterest income in 2006 was a $13 million gain resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition.  

 Noninterest expense in 2008 totaled $1.73 billion, up 6% from $1.63 billion in 2007. Noninterest expense in 2006 was $1.55 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $67 million, $66 million and $63 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $4 million in 2008, $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.66 billion in 2008, $1.55 billion in 2007 and $1.48 billion in 2006. Noninterest expenses in 2008 included an addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $16 million, as compared with partial reversals of the valuation allowance of $4 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006. Also contributing to the rise in operating expenses were higher expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real estate properties. Partially offsetting those factors was the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Banks obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation, compared with a partial  

 37   
 reversal of that charge in the first quarter of 2008 of $15 million. Included in operating expenses in 2006 was an $18 million tax-deductible contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. A similar $6 million contribution was made in 2008, whereas no such contribution was made in 2007. Excluding the impact of the Visa charge in 2007 and the charitable contribution in 2006, operating expenses in 2007 were up 4% from 2006, largely due to a higher level of salaries and employee benefits expense reflecting the impact of merit pay increases, increased incentive compensation and higher costs for providing medical benefits to employees.  

 The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 54.4% in 2008, compared with 52.8% in 2007 and 51.5% in 2006.

 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations  

 As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.4 billion at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $3.2 billion at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2006. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $41 million, $40 million and $38 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although  

 38   
 net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.  

 Net operating income totaled $599 million in 2008, compared with $704 million in 2007. Diluted net operating earnings per common share in 2008 declined 16% to $5.39 from $6.40 in 2007. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were $881 million and $7.73, respectively, during 2006.  

 Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per common share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share are presented in table 2.  

 Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was .97% in 2008, compared with 1.27% in 2007 and 1.67% in 2006. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 19.63% in 2008, compared with 22.58% and 29.55% in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

 Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis rose 5% to $1.96 billion in 2008 from $1.87 billion in 2007, largely the result of growth in average earning assets. Those assets totaled $58.0 billion in 2008, up 12% from $52.0 billion in 2007. Growth in average loan and lease balances outstanding, which rose 11% to $48.8 billion in 2008 from $44.1 billion in 2007, and average investment securities, which increased 23% to $9.0 billion in 2008 from $7.3 billion in 2007, were the leading factors in that improvement. A lower net interest margin, which declined to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007, partially offset the positive impact on taxable-equivalent net interest income resulting from growth in average earning assets.  

 Average loans and leases increased to $48.8 billion in 2008 from $44.1 billion in 2007. Most of the Companys major loan categories experienced growth during 2008, notwithstanding the impact of loans acquired in the late-2007 acquisition transactions. Average commercial loans and leases increased 13% to $13.8 billion in 2008 from $12.2 billion in 2007. Commercial real estate loans averaged $18.4 billion in 2008, up 17% from $15.7 billion in 2007. The Companys consumer loan portfolio averaged $11.2 billion in 2008, 9% higher than $10.2 billion in 2007. Average residential real estate loans declined 9% to $5.5 billion in 2008 from $6.0 billion in 2007, due largely to a $533 million decrease in average loans held for sale to $591 million in 2008 from $1.1 billion in 2007.  

 Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 2% to $1.87 billion in 2007 from $1.84 billion in 2006. Average earning assets rose $2.3 billion or 5% to $52.0 billion in 2007 from $49.7 billion in 2006. That growth resulted from a $2.7 billion or 7% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases, offset in part by a $717 million or 9% decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities. The positive impact of higher average earning assets on taxable-equivalent net interest income was offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in 2006.

 The Company experienced growth in all major loan categories in 2007, particularly during the second half of the year. Average commercial loans and leases increased 8% to $12.2 billion in 2007 from $11.3 billion in 2006. Commercial real estate loans averaged $15.7 billion in 2007, up 4% from $15.1 billion in 2006, due, in part, to higher average balances of construction loans. Average residential real estate loans rose 20% in 2007 to $6.0 billion from $5.0 billion in 2006. In March 2007, the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A residential real estate loans from the Companys held-for-sale loan portfolio to its held-for-investment portfolio. Residential real estate loans held for sale averaged $1.1 billion in 2007 and $1.5 billion during 2006. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.2 billion in 2007, up 2% from $10.0 billion in 2006, due in part to growth in the automobile loan portfolio.

 Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, aggregated $14.3 billion at December 31, 2008, representing 29% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents information on commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2008 relating to geographic area, size, borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $14.3 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2008, approximately $11.3 billion, or 79%, were secured, while 53%, 23% and 15% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia), respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2008 aggregated $1.4 billion, of which 48% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 16% were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area and another 11% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.

 International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $91 million and $107 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $1 million to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these programs at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $76 million and $95 million, respectively.  

 Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 60% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2008, compared with 61% in 2007 and 62% in 2006. At December 31, 2008, the Company held approximately $18.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, $4.9 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties (including $352 million of loans held for sale) and $5.7 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $17.4 billion, $6.2 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Loans obtained in the December 2007 acquisition transactions included $343 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential mortgages and $269 million of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit. As already noted, approximately $950 million of the $1.1 billion of acquired consumer real estate loans were securitized into Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities in December 2007. Included in total loans and leases were amounts due from builders and developers of residential real estate aggregating $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon, West Virginia and other states. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction and development loans made to investors, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 51% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2008. New York City metropolitan area commercial real estate loans totaled $6.6 billion at the 2008 year-end. The $5.7 billion of investor-owned commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties, retail space, and office space. The Companys experience has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 54% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less, while loans of more than $30 million made up approximately 22% of the total.

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied). Approximately 62% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of  

 46   
 commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 68% and 46%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less.  

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 9% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2008.  

 Commercial real estate construction and development loans made to investors presented in table 6 totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008, or 8% of total loans and leases. Approximately 94% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2008 were $1.7 billion of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Information about the credit performance of the Companys loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties is included herein under the heading Provision For Credit Losses. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multifamily residential housing, retail space and other commercial development.  

 M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2008 and 2007 aggregated $156 million and $79 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $6.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  

 Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008, including approximately 35% secured by properties located in New York State, 12% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 18% secured by properties located in the Mid-Atlantic area. At December 31, 2008, $352 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $774 million at December 31, 2007. As already discussed, in March 2007 the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A loans secured by residential real estate properties from its held-for-sale portfolio to its held-for-investment loan portfolio. The Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment at December 31, 2008 totaled $974 million, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Loans to individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties totaled $233 million at December 31, 2008, or approximately .5% of total loans and leases, compared with $417 million or 1% at December 31, 2007. Information about the credit performance of the Companys Alt-A mortgage loans and other residential mortgage loans is included herein under the heading Provision For Credit Losses.  

 Consumer loans comprised approximately 23% of the average loan portfolio during each of 2008 and 2007, compared with 24% in 2006. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 9% of average loans outstanding in each of 2008 and 2007. Automobile loans represented approximately 7% of the Companys average loan portfolio during each of 2008 and 2007. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2008. Approximately 51% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2008 were secured by properties in New York State, and 21% and 26% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were approximately $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion in 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, 33% and 22% of the automobile loan portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal  

 47   
 underwriting and loan approval procedures. Outstanding automobile loan balances declined to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008 from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007.  

 Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2008, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states. Approximately 51% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2008 were to New York State customers, while 19% and 17% were to Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area customers, respectively.

 Balances of investment securities averaged $9.0 billion in 2008, compared with $7.3 billion and $8.0 billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase of $1.7 billion or 23% from 2007 to 2008 was largely due to the impact of residential real estate loan securitizations in June and July of 2008 and in December 2007 and to the full-year impact of third quarter 2007 purchases of approximately $800 million of collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed securities. During June and July 2008, the Company securitized approximately $875 million of residential real estate loans in guaranteed mortgage securitizations with Fannie Mae. During December 2007, approximately $950 million of residential real estate loans obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition were securitized in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie Mae. The Company recognized no gain or loss on those securitization transactions as it retained all of the resulting securities, which are held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The decline in average investment securities during 2007 as compared with 2006 largely reflects net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and U.S. federal agency securities.  

 48   
 The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including credit and prepayment risk. In managing the investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a $142 million AAA-rated private placement mortgage-backed security that had been securitized by Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, Bayview Financial). Bayview Financial is a privately-held company and is the majority investor of BLG. Upon purchase, the security was placed in the Companys held-to-maturity portfolio, as management determined that it had the intent and ability to hold the security to maturity. Management subsequently reconsidered whether certain other similar mortgage-backed securities previously purchased from Bayview Financial and held in the Companys available-for-sale portfolio should more appropriately be in the held-to-maturity portfolio. Concluding that it had the intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity as well, the Company transferred collateralized mortgage obligations having a fair value of $298 million and a cost basis of $385 million from its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio during the third quarter of 2008.  

 The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. As previously discussed, during the third quarter of 2008 the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $153 million related to its holdings of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional other-than-temporary impairment charges of $29 million were recognized in 2008 on three collateralized mortgage obligations backed by option adjustable rate residential mortgages (ARMs) that had an amortized cost of $20 million and on three collateralized debt obligations backed by bank preferred capital securities that had an amortized cost of $12 million. The collateralized debt obligations were obtained in the Partners Trust transaction. As previously discussed, during 2007s fourth quarter, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of $127 million related to $132 million of collateralized debt obligations backed largely by residential mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company concluded that the remaining declines associated with the rest of the investment securities portfolio were temporary in nature. That conclusion was based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of each respective date. A further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading Capital. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $198 million in 2008, $503 million in 2007 and $183 million in 2006. Reflected in those balances were purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell which averaged $96 million and $417 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $50 million in 2006. The higher level of resell agreements in 2007 as compared with 2008 and 2006 was due, in part, to the need to collateralize deposits of municipalities. Outstanding resell agreements at December 31, 2008 totaled $90 million. The amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.  

 The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, nonbrokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Core deposits averaged $31.7 billion in 2008, up from  

 49   
 $28.6 billion in 2007 and $28.3 billion in 2006. The acquisition transactions in late-2007 added $2.0 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition dates, however, the Companys average core deposits in 2007 only increased $156 million from those transactions. The previously discussed June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added approximately $880 million to average core deposits during the second half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $274 million in 2008, $208 million in 2007 and $387 million in 2006. Funding provided by core deposits represented 55% of average earning assets in each of 2008 and 2007, and 57% in 2006. Core deposits totaled $34.3 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $30.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2008 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years.

 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.6 billion in 2008, $2.7 billion in 2007 and $2.9 billion in 2006. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $4.0 billion in 2008, $4.2 billion in 2007 and $3.6 billion in 2006. Average brokered time deposits totaled $1.4 billion in 2008, compared with $2.1 billion in 2007 and $3.5 billion in 2006, and at December 31, 2008 and 2007 totaled $487 million and $1.8 billion, respectively. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $70 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered NOW and money-market deposit accounts, which averaged $218 million, $87 million and $69 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.  

 The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve and others as sources of funding. The average balance of short-term borrowings was $6.1 billion in 2008, $5.4 billion in 2007 and $4.5 billion in 2006. Beginning in the second quarter of 2008, the Company actively sought to increase the average maturity of its non-deposit sources of funds and to reduce short-term borrowings. Average short-term borrowings for the 2008 quarters ended June 30, September 30 and December 31 totaled $6.9 billion, $5.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. Included in short-term borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, that averaged $4.5 billion, $4.6 billion and $3.7 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represented the largest component of average short-term borrowings and were obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Overnight federal funds borrowings totaled $809 million at December 31, 2008 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Also included in short-term borrowings in 2008 were secured borrowings with the Federal Reserve through their Term Auction  

 50   
 Facility (TAF). Borrowings under the TAF averaged $238 million during 2008, and totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Such borrowings had maturities of 84 days. Also included in average short-term borrowings was a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that was paid off during late-2008. All of the available amount of that structured borrowing was in use at the 2007 and 2006 year-ends. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings were included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The average balance of this borrowing was $463 million in 2008, $437 million in 2007 and $500 million in 2006. Additional information about that subsidiary, M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. Average short-term borrowings during 2008 and 2007 included $682 million and $160 million, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB of New York. There were no similar short-term borrowings in 2006.  

 Long-term borrowings averaged $11.6 billion in 2008, $8.4 billion in 2007 and $6.0 billion in 2006. Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLBs of $6.7 billion in 2008, $4.3 billion in 2007 and $3.8 billion in 2006, and subordinated capital notes of $1.9 billion in 2008, $1.6 billion in 2007 and $1.2 billion in 2006. M&T Bank issued $400 million and $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2007 and 2006, respectively, in part to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. The notes issued in December 2007 bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in December 2017. The 2006 notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until December 2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in December 2021, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .64%. Beginning December 2016, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of those notes on any interest payment date. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of long-term debt. Those swap agreements are used to hedge approximately $1.0 billion of fixed rate subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $1.1 billion, $716 million and $712 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities bearing a fixed rate of interest of 8.50% and maturing in 2068. The related junior subordinated debentures are included in long-term borrowings. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged $1.6 billion during 2008 and 2007, and $258 million during 2006. The agreements, which were entered into due to favorable rates available, have various repurchase dates through 2017, however, the contractual maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such repurchase dates. Long-term borrowings also include $300 million of senior notes issued by M&T in May 2007, which averaged $182 million during 2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.375% and mature in May 2012.  

 Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.01% in each of 2008 and 2007. The yield on earning assets during 2008 was 5.69%, 117 basis points lower than 6.86% in 2007, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities also decreased 117 basis points to 2.68% from 3.85% in 2007. The yield on the Companys earning assets rose 15 basis points in 2007 from 6.71% in 2006, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 2007 was up 24 basis points from 3.61% in 2006. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 3.10% in 2006 to 3.01% in 2007. During 2008, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate seven times, representing decreases of 400 basis points for the year, such that, at December 31, 2008 the Federal Reserves target rate for overnight federal funds was expressed as a range from 0% to .25%. In the last four months of 2007, the Federal Reserve lowered its federal funds target rate three times totaling 100 basis points. Contributing to the decline in net interest spread from 2006 to 2007 was the impact of funding the $300 million BLG investment in February 2007 as well as higher rates paid on deposits and variable-rate borrowings that were only partially offset by higher yields on loans and investment securities.  

 51   
 Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets and, in 2007 and 2008, M&Ts investment in BLG. Net interest-free funds averaged $8.1 billion in 2008, compared with $7.9 billion in 2007 and $8.2 billion in 2006. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.4 billion in 2008, $3.2 billion in 2007, and $3.1 billion in 2006. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.2 billion in 2008 and $1.1 billion in each of 2007 and 2006. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .37% in 2008, .59% in 2007 and .60% in 2006. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2008 as compared with 2007 resulted largely from the impact of significantly lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. The impact on such contribution of slightly higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities during 2007 as compared with 2006 was offset by the effect of a lower balance of interest-free funds.  

 Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.38% in 2008, compared with 3.60% in 2007 and 3.70% in 2006. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin.  

 Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008, all of which were designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed rate time deposits and long-term borrowings. Under the terms of those swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the agreements at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007, of which $842 million were designated as fair value hedges whereby the Company received payments at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. Under the terms of the remaining $1.5 billion of swap agreements outstanding at the 2007 year-end and that were designated as cash flow hedges, the Company paid a fixed rate of interest and received a variable rate. During the first quarter of 2008, those swap agreements were terminated by the Company, resulting in the realization of a loss of $37 million. That loss is being amortized over the original hedge period as an adjustment to interest expense associated with the previously hedged long-term borrowings.  

 In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented gains of approximately $146 million at December 31, 2008 and $17 million at December 31, 2007. The significant rise in fair value of those interest rate swap agreements resulted from sharply lower interest rates at the 2008 year-end as compared with December 31, 2007. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair values of the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges were losses of approximately $17 million  

 52   
 at December 31, 2007. Net of applicable income taxes, such losses were approximately $10 million and were included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. There were no swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2008 or at December 31, 2006. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. Additional information about those swap agreements and the items being hedged is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

  (b)    Weighted-average rate paid or received on interest rate swap agreements in effect during year.   

 Provision for Credit Losses  

 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $412 million in 2008, up from $192 million in 2007 and $80 million in 2006. Net loan charge-offs increased to $383 million in 2008 from $114 million and $68 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .78% in 2008, compared with .26% in 2007 and .16% in 2006. The significant increases in the provision for credit losses in 2007 and 2008 reflect a pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early-2007 and continued throughout 2008, and the deteriorating state of the U.S. economy, which was in recession during 2008. Declining real estate valuations and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs throughout 2007 and 2008 significantly affected the quality of the Companys residential real estate loan portfolio. Specifically, the Companys Alt-A residential real estate loan portfolio and its residential real estate builder and developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of the credit problems related to the turmoil in the residential real estate marketplace. In response to the deteriorating quality of the Alt-A portfolio, the Company decided in 2007s fourth quarter to accelerate the timing related to when residential real estate loans are charged off. Beginning in that quarter, the Company began charging off the excess of residential real estate loan balances over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan when such loans become past due 150 days, whereas previously the Company provided an allowance for credit losses for those amounts and charged off those loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property. The change in accounting procedure resulted in $15 million of additional charge-offs in 2007. A summary of the Companys loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.  

 53   
 Table 10  

 LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Nonaccrual loans aggregated $755 million or 1.54% of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2008, compared with $431 million or .90% at December 31, 2007 and $209 million or .49% at December 31, 2006. Major factors contributing to the rise in nonaccrual loans from the 2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 were a $124 million increase in loans to residential builders and developers and a $75 million increase in residential real estate loans. The continuing turbulence in the residential real estate marketplace has resulted in deteriorating real estate values and increased delinquencies, both for loans to consumers and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The rise in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2007 from a year earlier was largely due to a $139 million increase in residential real estate loans and an $83 million increase in loans to residential builders and developers. The increase in nonaccrual residential real estate loans was the result of the residential real estate market turmoil and its impact on the portfolio of Alt-A loans and reflected the change in accounting procedure in December 2007 whereby residential real estate loans were classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest became 90 days delinquent. Previously, residential real estate loans had been placed in nonaccrual status when payments were 180 days past due. At December 31, 2007 the impact of the acceleration of the classification of such loans as nonaccrual resulted in an increase in nonaccrual loans of $84 million  

 54   
 and a corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and accruing interest. The higher level of nonaccrual builder and developer loans was largely due to deteriorating residential real estate values.  

 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $159 million or .33% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2008, compared with $77 million or .16% at December 31, 2007 and $111 million or .26% at December 31, 2006. Those loans included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $114 million, $73 million and $77 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled $108 million at December 31, 2008, $67 million at December 31, 2007 and $65 million at December 31, 2006. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that totaled $5 million at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007, compared with $11 million at December 31, 2006. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due and renegotiated loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.  

 Table 11  

 NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE AND RENEGOTIATED LOAN DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Predominately residential mortgage loans.   

 During 2008, the Company modified loans secured by residential real estate having outstanding balances at December 31, 2008 of approximately $162 million. The modified loans were largely from the Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans. Of that total, $93 million of such loans were included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2008. After a period of demonstrated performance, those loans may begin to accrue interest in 2009. The remaining $69 million of modified residential real estate loans have demonstrated payment capability consistent with the modified terms and were classified as renegotiated loans, were current in their payments and were accruing interest at the 2008 year-end. Those modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates (generally from thirty to forty years) and lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase  

 55   
 loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. In accordance with GAAP, the modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as described in notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and due to the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios, real estate valuations, in particular. Although concerns exist about the factors and conditions described herein, through December 31, 2008 the increases in nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs have largely been centered in the Companys portfolios of residential real estate loans, including first and second lien Alt-A mortgage loans, and loans to developers and builders of residential real estate. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations, including valuations of residential real estate development or construction projects, can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $94 million in 2008, $24 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006. The rise in such charge-offs from 2007 to 2008 was largely due to charge-offs of loans to a consumer debt collections company, loans to two customers in the publishing business, and three loans to automobile dealers. Nonaccrual commercial loans and leases were $114 million at December 31, 2008 and $79 million at each of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase from the 2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 reflects the net addition of relationships with automobile dealers totaling $12 million. Reflecting the granularity of the Companys commercial loan and lease portfolio, there were only three loans classified as nonaccrual in the portfolio that exceeded $5 million. As compared with 2006, the addition of a number of smaller credits (less than $5 million) to the nonaccrual loan category during 2007 was largely offset by a $27 million net decline in nonaccrual loans to automobile dealers, predominantly due to payments received. Continued slowing of automobile sales over the last three years has resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $112 million, $6 million and $1 million, respectively. Reflected in 2008s charge-offs were $100 million of loans to residential real estate builders and developers, compared with $4 million in 2007. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $319 million at December 31, 2008, compared with $118 million at December 31, 2007 and $57 million at December 31, 2006. The rise in such loans during 2008 was largely the result of an increase of $124 million in loans to residential homebuilders and developers, reflecting the impact of the deterioration of the residential real estate market, including declining real estate values. The increase from the end of 2006 to the 2007 year-end was largely due to the addition of $83 million of loans to residential homebuilders and developers. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, loans to residential homebuilders and developers classified as nonaccrual aggregated $209 million and $85 million, respectively. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off loans to residential real estate builders and developers as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented in table 12.

 Table 12  

 RESIDENTIAL BUILDER AND DEVELOPER LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED DISCOUNT  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes approximately $.2 billion of loans either not secured by real estate or permanent loans to investors of apartments/multifamily properties.   

 Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries, were $63 million in 2008, $19 million in 2007 and $4 million in 2006. Nonaccrual residential real estate loans at the end of 2008 totaled $256 million, compared with $181 million and $42 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Declining real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies have contributed to the rise in residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual during 2007 and 2008 and to the level of charge-offs, largely in the Companys Alt-A portfolio. In addition, as already noted, the significant increase in such loans from December 31, 2006 to the 2007 year-end includes the effect of the change in accounting procedure for nonaccrual residential real estate loans. Included in residential real estate loan net charge-offs and nonaccrual loans were net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2008 of $44 million, while nonaccrual Alt-A loans aggregated $125 million at the 2008 year-end. As already noted, loans secured by residential real estate having outstanding balances of $162 million (including $12 million of junior lien home equity loans classified as consumer loans) at December 31, 2008, largely comprised of Alt-A loans, were modified during 2008 to assist borrowers. Of those loans, $93 million were in nonaccrual status at the 2008 year-end. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2007 were $12 million and nonaccrual Alt-A loans at December 31, 2007 totaled $90 million. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2006 were insignificant and nonaccrual Alt-A loans at December 31, 2006 were $19 million. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $108 million, $66 million and $92 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government-related entities. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented in table 13.  

 Net charge-offs of consumer loans during 2008 were $114 million, representing 1.03% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $65 million or .63% in 2007 and $43 million or .43% in 2006. Automobile loans represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of automobile loans were $51 million during 2008, $28 million during 2007 and $24 million during 2006. Consumer loan charge-offs also include recreational vehicle loans of $21 million, $11 million and $9 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $31 million during 2008, $16 million during 2007 and $2 million during 2006. The increases in charge-offs of home equity loans and lines of credit in 2007 and 2008 reflect higher Alt-A charge-offs. Nonaccrual consumer loans were $66 million at December 31, 2008, representing .60% of outstanding consumer loans, compared with $53 million or .47% at December 31, 2007, and $31 million or .31% at December 31, 2006. The Company experienced a decline in delinquencies in the consumer loan portfolio during 2008, as compared with the preceding two years. At the 2008, 2007 and 2006 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent 30-90 days totaled $118 million, $155 million and $122 million, respectively, or 1.07%, 1.38% and 1.23% of outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $1 million at each of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and $3 million at December 31, 2006. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented in table 13.

 SELECTED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE-RELATED LOAN DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the impact of declining residential real estate values in the Companys portfolio of loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the Companys portfolio of Alt-A residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis.  

 Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2008 in light of (i) the declining residential real estate values and emergence of higher levels of delinquencies of residential real estate loans; (ii) the declining pace of economic growth in many of the markets served by the Company; (iii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and (v) the amount of loan growth experienced by the Company. Throughout 2008, there had been considerable concerns about the deepening economic downturn in both national and international markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; rising private sector layoffs and unemployment, which caused consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of automobile sales. Late in 2008 the U.S economy was identified as having been in recession since the fourth quarter of 2007. However, given that approximately 70% of the Companys loans are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania, including a large portion to customers in the traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, the impact of deteriorating national market conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in these regions as compared with other areas of the country. Home prices in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania increased in 2008, in sharp contrast to steep declines in values in other regions of the country. Therefore, despite the conditions, as previously described, the most severe credit issues experienced by the Company through 2008 were centered around residential real estate, including loans to developers and builders of residential real estate in areas other than New York State and Pennsylvania. In response, throughout 2008 the Company conducted detailed reviews of all loans to residential real estate builders and developers that exceeded $2.5 million. Those credit reviews were updated throughout the year and resulted in adjustments to loan grades and, if appropriate, commencement of intensified collection efforts, including foreclosure. With regard to residential real estate loans, with special emphasis on the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan work-out staff and further refined its loss identification and estimation techniques by reference to loan performance and house price depreciation data in specific areas of the country where collateral that was securing the Companys residential real estate loans was located.  

 In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and detailed or intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. In quantifying incurred  

 59   
 losses, the Company considers the factors and uses the techniques described herein. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Nevertheless, modified loans, including smaller balance homogenous loans, that are considered to be troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the present value of the loans cash flows. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114.  

 The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards.  

 Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral values, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry.  

 To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories, beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for certain national and local economic conditions have been included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result, probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans, have been included in the inherent base level loss components at the last three year-ends.  

 In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on internally and externally prepared valuations. In 2008, valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay  

 60   
 in the recognition of credit quality changes in loans in assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality and, accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2008, but were indicative of a slowing economy as compared with 2007. Private sector employment in the upstate New York market declined by 0.4% in 2008, slightly less than the national average decline of 0.5%. This was compared with growth in 2007 in upstate New York of 0.5%, compared with the national average, which grew 1.3%. Employment growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company was flat in 2008, while growth in the Maryland and Greater Washington D.C. regions exceeded the national average. During 2007, job growth in the Companys Pennsylvania markets and in Maryland matched the national average, while the Greater Washington D.C. region exceeded the national average. Job growth in New York City (0.6%) was higher than the national average in 2008 and 2007. However, significant layoffs in the financial services sector in the final quarter of 2008 are expected to weigh heavily on New York City economic growth in 2009. Nevertheless, despite the statistical job growth noted, at the end of 2008 there were significant concerns about the impact on the national economy resulting from the possibility of an extended national economic recession, rising unemployment, real estate valuations, high levels of consumer indebtedness, weak automobile sales and volatile energy prices. Those factors are expected to have a significant impact on the national economy in 2009.  

 The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as: (i) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (ii) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; (iii) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance; and (iv) other additional risks associated with the Companys loan portfolio, which may not be specifically allocable.  

 A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 14. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components, including the impact of the increased delinquencies and nonaccrual loans that are secured by residential real estate in 2008 and 2007. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $617 million at December 31, 2008 and $225 million at December 31, 2007. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $124 million at December 31, 2008 and $55 million at December 31, 2007. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .15% and .19% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The slight decline in the unallocated portion reflects managements continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques, which has increased the precision of its calculation of the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. However, given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of real estate loans and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category.

 Table 14  

 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2008 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $788 million or 1.61% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2008, compared with $759 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2007 and $650 million or 1.51% at December 31, 2006. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein, including the impact of lower residential real estate values, largely in areas other than New York State and central Pennsylvania, and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs in the Companys portfolio of residential real estate loans, lower residential real estate valuations related to loans to residential builders and developers, and the Companys loan charge-off policies. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonaccrual loans at the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 104%, 176% and 311%, respectively. Given the Companys position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the Companys allowance for credit losses, nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the allowance. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.  

 In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows the methodology described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality:  

       For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20% increase in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 62   
 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were:  

       For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $89 million that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $20 million reduction could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors.  

 Investor-owned commercial real estate loans secured by retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2008. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2008. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $91 million at December 31, 2008, or .19% of total loans and leases.  

 Real estate and other foreclosed assets increased to $100 million at December 31, 2008 from $40 million at December 31, 2007 and $12 million at December 31, 2006. The increase from the prior year-ends to December 31, 2008 resulted from higher residential real estate loan defaults and additions from residential real estate development projects. At December 31, 2008, the Companys holding of residential real estate-related properties comprised 84% of foreclosed assets.  

 Other Income  

 Other income increased 1% to $939 million in 2008 from $933 million in 2007. Reflected in those amounts were losses from bank investment securities in 2008 and 2007 of $148 million and $126 million, respectively, due in large part to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of the Companys collateralized debt obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding the impact of those securities losses, noninterest income was $1.09 billion in 2008, 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. That rise was largely due to higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for providing deposit account, trust, brokerage and credit-related services, partially offset by a $46 million decline in M&Ts pro-rata share of the operating results of BLG and lower trading account and foreign exchange gains.  

 Other income in 2007 was 11% below the $1.05 billion earned in 2006. As discussed above, reflected in other income in 2007 were losses from bank investment securities of $126 million, compared with gains of $3 million in 2006. Excluding the impact of securities gains or losses, other income of $1.06 billion in 2007 was 2% higher than $1.04 billion in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains, and $9 million related to M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG, were largely offset by a $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues and a $13 million gain in 2006 from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million borrowing from the FHLB of Atlanta.  

 Mortgage banking revenues were $156 million in 2008, $112 million in 2007 and $143 million in 2006. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multifamily mortgage loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  

 Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees and income, were $117 million in 2008, $86 million in 2007 and $114 million in 2006. The lower revenues in 2007 reflect the previously described $18 million of Alt-A-related losses in that years first quarter and the impact of lower gains on residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights  

 63   
 due to slimmer margins realized by the Company resulting from changes in market conditions during that year.  

 Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $4.4 billion in 2008, compared with $5.6 billion in 2007 and $6.4 billion in 2006. Residential mortgage loans sold to investors totaled $4.4 billion in 2008, $5.3 billion in 2007 and $5.0 billion in 2006. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $31 million in 2008, compared with $3 million in 2007 and $41 million in 2006. Reflected in the 2008 gains were approximately $7 million of revenues related to the January 1, 2008 adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109 for written loan commitments issued or modified after January 1, 2008. In November 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 109, which reversed previous conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the fair value measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In accordance with SAB No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments, the Company had not included such amounts in the value of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives in 2007 or 2006. As previously described, reflected in the 2007 gains were $18 million of losses related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans that were recognized during the first quarter of 2007.  

 Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others rose to $81 million in 2008 from $73 million in 2007 and $66 million in 2006. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $29 million, $21 million and $14 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others aggregated $21.3 billion at December 31, 2008, $19.4 billion a year earlier and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2006, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $5.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $143 million at December 31, 2008, compared with $170 million and $153 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $22 million, $6 million and $10 million at the 2008, 2007 and 2006 year-ends, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $58 million, $57 million and $36 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In addition, at December 31, 2008 capitalized servicing rights included $28 million of servicing rights for $4.6 billion of residential real estate loans that were purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is provided in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre-determined rates were $898 million and $871 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008, $772 million and $492 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and $1.8 billion and $680 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Net unrealized gains on hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $6 million and $4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2006, respectively, compared with net unrealized losses of $7 million at December 31, 2007. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net increases in revenue of $13 million and $2 million in 2008 and 2006, respectively, and a net decrease in revenue of $23 million (including $12 million to record the Alt-A mortgage loans transferred from held for sale to held for investment at the lower of cost or market value) in 2007.  

 Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $39 million in 2008, $26 million in 2007 and $29 million in 2006. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $27 million in 2008,  

 64   
 compared with $13 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006. The increased revenues in 2008 reflect higher loan origination volumes. Commercial mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $1.4 billion in 2008, compared with $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Loan servicing revenues totaled $12 million in 2008, $13 million in 2007 and $14 million in 2006. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets aggregated $26 million at December 31, 2008, $20 million at December 31, 2007 and $21 million at December 31, 2006. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $6.4 billion, $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and included $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $939 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $408 million and $252 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008, $176 million and $97 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and $115 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $156 million, $79 million and $49 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 Service charges on deposit accounts rose 5% to $431 million in 2008 from $409 million in 2007. Deposit account service charges in 2006 were $381 million. The higher level of service charges on deposit accounts in 2008 as compared with 2007 was largely due to increases in service charges on commercial accounts and consumer debit card fees due to higher transaction volumes. The higher level of such revenues in 2007 as compared with 2006 was largely due to consumer service charges related to overdraft fees and higher debit card transaction volumes.  

 Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income rose 2% to $156 million in 2008 from $153 million in 2007, due in part to the impact of higher balances in proprietary money- market mutual funds. Trust income totaled $141 million in 2006. Higher balances in proprietary money-market mutual funds and higher revenues from providing personal trust and investment management services contributed to the rise in revenues from 2006 to 2007. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, aggregated $111.0 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $146.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The decrease in total trust assets was due, in part, to declines in the market values of such assets. Trust assets under management were $12.8 billion and $15.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Companys proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $11.5 billion and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $64 million in 2008 and $60 million in each of 2007 and 2006. The improvement from 2007 to 2008 was due largely to increased revenues earned from the sale of annuities. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $18 million in 2008, $30 million in 2007 and $25 million in 2006. The decline from 2007 to 2008 resulted from declines in the market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. The improvement in 2007 as compared with 2006 reflected higher income related to interest rate swap agreements due to higher volumes of transactions executed on behalf of commercial customers. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $21 million in each of 2008 and 2007, and $15 million in 2006. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $33 million and $47 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Trading account losses resulting from net declines in the market values of such assets were $12 million in 2008, compared with revenues of $4 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. A largely offsetting impact on expenses resulting from corresponding increases or decreases in liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations.

 As previously described, other-than-temporary impairment charges of $182 million were recognized in 2008, largely in light of significant turbulence in the financial markets, including the residential real estate market, and the resulting declines in fair value of the Companys preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and certain privately issued mortgage-backed securities held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Partially offsetting the 2008 impairment charges was a gain of $33 million related to the mandatory redemption of common shares of Visa during the first quarter of that year. Reflecting those events, losses on investment securities were $148 million in 2008, compared with losses of $126 million in 2007 and gains of $3 million during 2006. The losses in 2007 reflect the previously described $127 million charge for the other-than-temporary impairment in value of collateralized debt obligations held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Those collateralized debt obligations were backed by residential mortgage-backed securities. Each reporting period the Company reviews its impaired investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For equity securities, such as the Companys investment in the preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Company considers various factors to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary, including the duration and extent of the decline in value, the factors contributing to the decline in fair value, including the financial condition of the issuer as well as the conditions of the industry in which it operates, and the prospects for a recovery in fair value of the equity security. For debt securities, the Company analyzes the creditworthiness of the issuer or reviews the credit performance of the underlying loan collateral supporting the bond. For debt securities backed by pools of loans, such as privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company attempts to estimate the cash flows of the underlying loan collateral using forward-looking assumptions of default rates, loss severities and prepayment speeds. Estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to estimate bond-specific cash flows to determine the ultimate collectibility of the bond. If it is deemed probable that the Company will not collect the contractual cash flows of a bond or if the Company no longer has the ability or intent to hold a bond until it fully recovers in value, an other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized. If an other-than-temporary impairment loss is deemed to have occurred, the investment securitys cost basis is adjusted to its fair value with the loss being recognized in the consolidated statement of income.  

 M&Ts pro-rata share of the operating loss of BLG in 2008 was $37 million, compared with a gain of $9 million in 2007. The operating loss of BLG in 2008 resulted from the disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and reflected lower gains from loan securitization and sales activities, lower values ascribed to loans held for sale, and costs associated with severance and certain lease terminations incurred by BLG as it downsized its operations. Despite the credit and liquidity disruptions that began in 2007, BLG had been successfully securitizing and selling significant volumes of small-balance commercial real estate loans until the first quarter of 2008. In response to the illiquidity in the marketplace, BLG reduced its originations activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its contingent liquidity sources. The Company believes that significant fluctuations are expected as part of the business cycle of any mortgage origination and securitization business. In addition to BLGs mortgage origination and sales activities, BLG also is entitled to cash flows from mortgage assets that it owns or that are owned by its affiliates and from asset management and other services provided by its affiliates. Accordingly, the Company believes that BLG is capable of realizing positive cash flows that could be available for distribution to its owners, including M&T, despite a lack of positive GAAP-earnings. Nevertheless, if BLG is not able to realize sufficient cash flows for the benefit of M&T, the Company may be required to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge in a future period for some portion of the $271 million book value of its investment in BLG. Information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other revenues from operations were $300 million in 2008, compared with $286 million in 2007 and $293 million in 2006. The primary contributor to the 5% improvement from 2007 to 2008 was a $16 million increase in letter of credit and other credit-related fees. The decline in other revenues from operations from 2006 to 2007 resulted from a $6 million decrease in income from bank owned life insurance and the previously noted $13 million gain in 2006 from the call of an FHLB borrowing, partially offset by an $8 million increase in credit-related and corporate advisory fees in 2007.  

 Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees totaled $97 million, $81 million and $77 million in 2008, 2007 and  

 66   
 2006, respectively. The rise in such fees from 2007 to 2008 was due predominately to higher income from providing loan syndication and letter of credit services. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $49 million in 2008, $47 million in 2007 and $53 million in 2006. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $40 million in 2008, $35 million in 2007 and $32 million in 2006. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $31 million in 2008, $33 million in 2007 and $32 million in 2006. Automated teller machine usage fees aggregated $17 million in 2008 and $15 million in each of 2007 and 2006.  

 Other Expense  

 Other expense aggregated $1.73 billion in 2008, compared with $1.63 billion in 2007 and $1.55 billion in 2006. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $67 million, $66 million and $63 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $4 million in 2008, $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.66 billion in 2008, up 7% from $1.55 billion in 2007. The higher level of operating expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due largely to increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real estate properties. Also contributing to the rise in operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting those factors was a $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Banks obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in 2008s initial quarter of $15 million. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.48 billion in 2006. The rise in operating expenses from 2006 to 2007 reflects the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter related to the Visa litigation, partially offset by an $18 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation in 2006. The most significant contributor to the remaining increase in noninterest expense in 2007 was a higher level of salaries and employee benefits expense. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense.  

 Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $957 million in 2008, up 5% from $908 million in 2007. The most significant contributors to the increase were the impact of annual merit increases, higher incentive compensation and the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition transactions. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $873 million in 2006. The higher expense level for 2007 as compared with 2006 was due largely to salaries-related costs, including the impact of merit pay increases and higher incentive compensation. Stock-based compensation totaled $50 million in 2008, and $51 million in each of 2007 and 2006. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 12,978 at December 31, 2008, compared with 13,246 and 12,721 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $52 million in 2008, and $54 million in each of 2007 and 2006. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was $23 million in 2008, $27 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2006. Included in those amounts are $10 million in 2008, $8 million in 2007 and $7 million in 2006 for a defined contribution pension plan that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that  

 67   
 would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment.  

 The Companys 2008 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long-term rate of return on assets of 7.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.60%; and a discount rate of 6.00%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $334 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $4 million in 2008, $6 million in 2007 and $8 million in 2006.  

 In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost, be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in 2006. As of December 31, 2008, the combined benefit obligations of the Companys defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $263 million. Of that amount, $152 million was related to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and $111 million related to non-qualified pension and other postretirement plans that are generally not funded until benefits are paid. Pursuant to the criteria of SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans that was at least equal to $263 million at December 31, 2008. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of $286 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby stockholders equity) by $174 million. The result of this was a year-over-year increase of $210 million to the required minimum postretirement benefit liability from the $76 million recorded at December 31, 2007. After applicable tax effect, the $210 million increase in the minimum required liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income in 2008 by an additional $128 million from the prior year-end amount of $46 million. The $210 million increase to the liability was necessary to reflect losses that occurred during 2008 resulting from actual experience differing from assumptions and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The main factor contributing to those losses was the poor performance of the  

 68   
 qualified defined benefit plan assets, reflecting the overall significant decline in global financial markets. In determining the benefit obligation for defined benefit postretirement plans the Company used a discount rate of 6% at December 31, 2008 and 2007. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2008 to 5.75% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans) of $28 million. Under that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment at December 31, 2008 would have been $314 million, rather than the $286 million that was actually recorded, and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 would have been $191 million, rather than the $174 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 6.25% would have decreased the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by $27 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2008 would have been $259 million rather than the $286 million actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been $158 million rather than $174 million. The Company made contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2008 and 2007 of $140 million and $66 million, respectively. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company also provides a retirement savings plan (RSP) that is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $23 million in 2008, $22 million in 2007 and $21 million in 2006.  

 Expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $47 million in 2008 and $49 million in each of 2007 and 2006. Expense associated with providing medical and other postretirement benefits was $5 million in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006.  

 Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $700 million in 2008, up 9% from $639 million in 2007. Contributing to that rise were increases in costs for occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation, and foreclosed residential real estate properties. Also contributing to the higher level of operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting those factors was the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Banks obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in 2008s initial quarter of $15 million. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $611 million in 2006. The principal factors for the increase from 2006 to 2007 were the $23 million charge taken in 2007 related to the Visa litigation, the impact of net partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled $4 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006, and higher costs related to the merchant and credit card business and foreclosed residential real estate properties, offset, in part, by an $18 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation in 2006. That foundation did not need incremental funding in 2007.  

 Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes was $184 million in 2008, compared with $309 million in 2007 and $392 million in 2006. The effective tax rates were 24.9%, 32.1% and 31.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The significant decline in the Companys effective tax rate from 2007 to 2008 reflects the resolution in 2008 of previously uncertain tax positions related to the Companys activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007 that allowed the Company to reduce its accrual for income taxes in the third quarter of 2008 by $40 million. Exclusive of the impact of the $40 million credit to income taxes, the effective tax rate in 2008 was 30.3%.  

 The effective tax rate is impacted by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income and by the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among those jurisdictions. Although  

 69   
 the other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2008 and 2007 are fully deductible for purposes of computing income tax expense, those charges had an impact on the effective tax rate because they significantly lowered pre-tax income relative to the amounts of tax-exempt income and other permanent differences that impact the effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of the (i) other-than-temporary impairment charges from pre-tax income and income tax expense in 2008 and 2007 and (ii) the $40 million credit to income tax expense in 2008 resulting from the resolution of previously unrecognized tax benefits, the Companys effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 would have been 32.0% and 32.9%, respectively.  

 The Companys effective tax rate in future periods will also be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change in income tax regulations within those jurisdictions, or interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 International Activities  

 The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $99 million at December 31, 2008 and $120 million at December 31, 2007. Such assets included $91 million and $107 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2007. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable.  

 Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity  

 As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.  

 Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 60% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2008, compared with 54% and 57% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and others. At December 31, 2008, M&T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $8.8 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $8.0 billion and $6.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately $7.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The amounts of those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008, secured short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve totaled $1.0 billion. Those borrowings were bid for by the Company through the Federal Reserves TAF program and had maturities of 84 days. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2007.  

 As a source of funding and to enhance regulatory capital ratios, during January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities bearing a fixed rate of interest of 8.50% and maturing in 2068. The related junior subordinated debentures are included in long-term borrowings. Such securities qualify for inclusion in the Companys Tier I Capital as defined by Federal  

 70   
 Regulators. As an additional source of funding, M&T issued $300 million of senior notes in May 2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.375% and are due on May 24, 2012.  

 The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. M&T Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes in December 2007. The notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in December 2017. In December 2006, M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes, which bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% for ten years and a floating rate thereafter, at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable at the Companys option after the fixed-rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory approval. Additional information about the Companys borrowings is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were $809 million and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In general, those borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally mature on the next business day and totaled $4.0 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Outstanding brokered time deposits at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $487 million and $1.8 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was 14 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. Information regarding such deposits is included under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities.  

 The Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively affected should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 15. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.  

 Table 15  

 DEBT RATINGS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit provided by M&T  

 71   
 Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $29 million and $63 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

  (a)    The data do not include nonaccrual loans.   

 The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in table 17. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2008 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

 Table 17  

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and common stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, approximately $832 million at December 31, 2008 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities, including $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities issued by M&T Capital Trust IV in January 2008, and in the second quarter of 2007 by the issuance of $300 million of senior notes payable. Information regarding trust preferred securities, the related junior subordinated debentures and the senior notes is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2007.

 Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.  

 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Companys core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $1.1 billion. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

 The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are  

 75   
 not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.  

 Table 20 displays as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 the estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.  

 Table 20  

 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income.  

 In accordance with industry practice, table 21 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.

 Changes in fair value of the Companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to the Companys investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of such securities is presented herein under the heading Capital and in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have also included forward and futures contracts related to mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities.  

 The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes aggregated $14.6 billion at December 31, 2008 and $11.7 billion at December 31, 2007. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $713 million and $801 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities were $618 million and $521 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008 and $281 million and $143 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The significant rise in the fair value of both trading assets and trading liabilities was largely due to the impact  

 77   
 of sharp declines in interest rates in late 2008 on the fair values of interest rate swap agreements held in the trading portfolio. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $33 million and $47 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $38 million and $50 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income.  

 Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions associated with the Companys trading activities. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Capital  

 Total stockholders equity at December 31, 2008 was $6.8 billion and represented 10.31% of total assets, compared with $6.5 billion or 10.00% at December 31, 2007 and $6.3 billion or 11.01% at December 31, 2006. Contributing to the growth of stockholders equity from the 2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 was the December 23, 2008 issuance of $600 million of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase M&T common stock as part of the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. The holder of the preferred stock is entitled to cumulative cash dividends of 5% per annum until February 14, 2014 and 9% per annum thereafter, payable quarterly in arrears. The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable on or after February 15, 2012, subject to regulatory approval. The preferred stock may be redeemed prior to February 15, 2012 if M&T received aggregated gross proceeds of not less than 25% of the aggregate liquidation amount of the Series A Preferred Stock from a qualified equity offering by M&T. Additional information related to M&Ts Series A Preferred Stock and the related warrants to purchase common stock is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Common stockholders equity was $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share, at December 31, 2008, compared with $6.5 billion, or $58.99 per share, at December 31, 2007 and $6.3 billion, or $56.94 per share, at December 31, 2006. Tangible equity per common share was $25.94 at December 31, 2008, compared with $27.98 and $28.57 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, common stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total common stockholders equity and tangible common equity as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is presented in table 2. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 9.88%, 10.67% and 10.82%, respectively. The ratio of average common stockholders equity to average total assets was 9.86%, 10.67% and 10.82% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $557 million, or $5.04 per common share, at December 31, 2008, compared with losses of $59 million, or $.54 per common share, at December 31, 2007, and $25 million, or $.23 per share, at December 31, 2006. Such unrealized losses represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale and the remaining unamortized losses on investment securities that have been transferred from available for sale to held to maturity. The increase in net unrealized losses resulted primarily from pre-tax net unrealized losses of $786 million on $3.2 billion of privately issued mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2008. The Companys privately issued mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale are generally collateralized by prime and Alt-A residential mortgage loans as depicted in table 22. Information in the table is as of  

 78   
 December 31, 2008. As with any accounting estimate or other data, changes in fair values and investment ratings may occur at any time.  

 Table 22  

 PRIVATELY ISSUED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE (a)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    All information is as of December 31, 2008.   

 Due to the severe disruption in the credit markets during the second half of 2008, trading activity for privately issued mortgage-backed securities was significantly reduced. In estimating values for such securities, the Company was significantly restricted in the level of market observable assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Because of the inactivity and the lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company transferred $2.2 billion of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio from Level 2 to Level 3 valuations in the third quarter of 2008. The remaining portion of its portfolio of privately issued mortgage-backed securities had already been classified as Level 3. To supplement its determination of fair value for its privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company engaged a second independent pricing source at December 31, 2008. Additionally, to help assess the reasonableness of valuations received from the independent pricing sources, the Company performed internal modeling techniques to estimate the expected cash flows that may result from many of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities. In general, the Company averaged the results obtained from the independent sources when valuing the Level 3 privately issued mortgage-backed securities for financial statement purposes. During 2008 the Company recognized $182 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses, $18 million of which related to $20 million of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Despite rising levels of delinquencies and losses in the underlying residential mortgage collateral, the Company believes that as of December 31, 2008 it was not probable that there was insufficient subordination within the structures of its remaining privately issued mortgage-backed securities to absorb expected losses and has therefore concluded that such securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired as of that date. Nevertheless, given recent market conditions, it is possible that adverse changes in repayment performance and fair value could occur in 2009 and later years that could impact the Companys conclusions. Management has modeled various stress scenarios to the above portfolio and has concluded that even if home price depreciation and current delinquency trends persist for an extended period of time, the Companys principal losses, if any, on its privately issued mortgage-backed securities would be substantially less than their current fair valuation losses.  

 As previously noted, given the Companys relationship with Bayview Financial and related entities, during the third quarter of 2008, the Company reconsidered its intention to hold certain collateralized mortgage obligations securitized by Bayview Financial with a cost basis of $385 million and a fair value  

 79   
 of $298 million and transferred such securities from its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to its held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio. As a result, at December 31, 2008, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio collateralized mortgage obligations securitized by Bayview Financial with an amortized cost basis of $412 million (excluding $82 million of unamortized fair value adjustment (pre-tax) residing in accumulated other comprehensive income from the time of transfer) and a fair value of $319 million. At December 31, 2008, the amortized cost and fair value of collateralized mortgage obligations securitized by Bayview Financial in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were $40 million and $32 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 were $480 million and $450 million, respectively. The Company has determined that it expects to fully collect its contractual principal and interest payments on the private collateralized mortgage obligations securitized by Bayview Financial and therefore believes such securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2008.  

 At December 31, 2008, the Company also had pre-tax unrealized losses of $90 million on $241 million of trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions ($13 million of such unrealized losses were on $16 million of securities using a Level 3 valuation, with the remainder classified as Level 2 valuations). Pre-tax unrealized losses of $9 million existed on $192 million of such securities at December 31, 2007. After evaluating the expected repayment performance of financial institutions where trust preferred securities were held directly by the Company or were within the collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition, the Company, during 2008, recognized an $11 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment loss on $12 million of the securities obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition.  

 Following the U.S. Governments placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7, 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $153 million (pre-tax) on its preferred stock holdings of those government-sponsored entities. At December 31, 2008, the Companys investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock had a remaining cost basis of $9 million and a fair value of $2 million. The Company recognized a $127 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 resulting from the decline in fair value of certain collateralized debt obligations backed by sub-prime mortgage securities held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio based on its evaluation at the time that it was probable that the Company would not receive all payments owed to it under the terms and structure of the securities.  

 As of December 31, 2008, based on a review of each of the remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that it was not probable that it would be unable to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate interest payments on such securities. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the declines in the values of those securities were temporary and that any additional other-than-temporary impairment charges were not appropriate at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had the ability and intent to hold each of the impaired securities, that is where fair value is less than the cost basis of the security, to recovery. The Company intends to closely monitor the performance of the privately issued mortgage-backed securities and other securities to assess if changes in their underlying credit performance or other events cause the cost basis of those securities to become other-than-temporarily impaired. However, because the unrealized losses described have generally already been reflected in the financial statement values for investment securities and stockholders equity, any recognition of an other-than-temporary decline in value of these investment securities would not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition. Additional information concerning fair value measurements and the Companys approach to the classification of such measurements is included in note 20 of the Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income were net losses of $6 million, or $.05 per common share, representing the remaining unrealized losses related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements that had been designated as cash flow hedges. Included in this amount were unamortized losses of $7 million related to swap agreements terminated by the Company in response to changes in its interest rate risk profile during the first quarter of 2008 that had been originally entered into as a cash flow hedge of variable rate long-term borrowings, and $1 million of unamortized gains related to terminated swap agreements that had been entered into as a cash flow hedge in anticipation of the  

 80   
 Company issuing senior notes payable in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, net unrealized fair value losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges were $10 million at December 31, 2007, representing approximately $.09 per common share. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2008 or at December 31, 2006.  

 Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as required under SFAS No. 158, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $174 million, or $1.58 per common share, at December 31, 2008, $46 million, or $.42 per common share, at December 31, 2007, and $28 million, or $.26 per common share, at December 31, 2006. The increase in such adjustment in 2008 was predominately the result of actual investment performance of assets held by the Companys qualified pension plan being significantly worse than that assumed for actuarial purposes. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Cash dividends paid in 2008 on M&Ts common stock totaled $309 million, compared with $282 million and $250 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the second quarter of 2006 from $.45 to $.60 per share, and to $.70 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Dividends per common share totaled $2.80 in 2008, $2.60 in 2007 and $2.25 in 2006.  

 M&T repurchased 4,514,800 shares of its common stock in 2007 and 3,259,000 shares in 2006 at a cost of $509 million and $374 million, respectively. There were no common stock repurchases by M&T in 2008. In November 2005, M&T had announced a plan to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. That repurchase plan was completed in March 2007. In February 2007, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2008, M&T had repurchased a total of 2,818,500 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $108.30 per share.  

 Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2008, core capital included $1.1 billion of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and $600 million of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase M&Ts common stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. Total capital further included $1.6 billion of subordinated notes. As previously noted, in January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities that pay a fixed rate of interest of 8.50%, and in December 2007 M&T Bank issued $400 million of 6.625% fixed rate subordinated notes due 2017. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company continues to generate amounts of regulatory capital in excess of dividends paid. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 7.51% in 2008, 10.73% in 2007 and 17.52% in 2006.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net income totaled $102 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, up 57% from $65 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were each $.92 in the final quarter of 2008, 53% higher than $.60 in the fourth quarter of 2007. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2008 were .63% and 6.41%, respectively, compared with .42% and 4.05%, respectively, in the year-earlier period.  

 Net operating income totaled $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $84 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.00 in the recent quarter, compared with $.77 in the final quarter of 2007. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in the last quarter of 2008 were .72% and 15.01%, respectively, compared with .57% and 10.49%, respectively, in the similar 2007 quarter. Core  

 81   
 deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $10 million in each of the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2007 ($.08 per diluted common share and $.09 per diluted common share, respectively). The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses associated with the Partners Trust and First Horizon acquisition transactions was $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of diluted earnings per common share in the final 2007 quarter. There were no similar expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2008 and 2007 are provided in table 24.  

 The Companys financial results for the recent quarter were damped by three main factors. Based on a detailed review of its investment securities portfolio, other-than-temporary impairment charges of $24 million (pre-tax) were recorded by the Company on certain collateralized debt obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations. Also recorded in the fourth quarter was a $19 million (pre-tax) addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. That addition resulted from lower mortgage interest rates at the 2008 year-end as compared with September 30, 2008. Those two items reduced the Companys fourth quarter 2008 net income and diluted earnings per common share by $26 million and $.24, respectively. Also negatively impacting fourth quarter 2008 results was a significantly higher provision for credit losses, which rose 50% to $151 million from $101 million in the year-earlier quarter. The Companys fourth quarter 2007 results were also adversely impacted by several notable items, including the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to collateralized debt obligations, the $23 million accrual related to Covered Litigation of Visa, and $15 million of merger-related expenses associated with acquisitions completed in that quarter.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 3% to $491 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from $476 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth was the result of a 6% rise in average earning assets that was partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $57.9 billion in the last quarter of 2008, compared with $54.8 billion in the year-earlier period. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $48.8 billion, up 6% from $46.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2007. Increases of $1.7 billion in commercial loans and leases, $2.2 billion in commercial real estate loans and $310 million in consumer loans were partially offset by a $1.4 billion decline in average residential real estate loans. The yield on earning assets was 5.35% in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 130 basis points from 6.65% in the year-earlier quarter. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.32% in the final quarter of 2008, 143 basis points lower than 3.75% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The resulting net interest spread was 3.03% in the recent quarter, up 13 basis points from 2.90% in the similar quarter of 2007. That improvement was largely due to market volatility in the fourth quarter resulting in divergence in the spread between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR, wherein rates paid by M&T on certain short-term borrowings and foreign office deposits declined more than rates paid by M&T customers on certain variable-rate loans. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the Companys net interest margin was .34% in the last 2008 quarter, down from .55% in the year-earlier quarter. That decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. As a result, the Companys net interest margin narrowed to 3.37% in the recent quarter from 3.45% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  

 The provision for credit losses rose to $151 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2008 from $101 million in the year-earlier period. The higher level of the provision reflects changes in the loan portfolio, the impact of declining residential real estate valuations and higher delinquencies and charge-offs of residential real estate loans, declining real estate values related to residential real estate builder and developer loan collateral, and the impact of the recession being experienced by the U.S. economy. Net charge-offs of loans were $144 million in 2008s final three months, representing an annualized 1.17% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $53 million or .46% during the final quarter of 2007. Net charge-offs included: residential real estate loans of $19 million in the recent quarter, compared with $10 million a year earlier when the Companys charge-off procedure was changed; loans to builders and developers of residential properties of $26 million, up from $4 million a year earlier; other commercial real estate loans of $3 million, compared with $1 million in 2007s final quarter; commercial loans of $61 million, up from $9 million in 2007; and consumer loans of $35 million, compared with $29 million in the prior year fourth quarter.  

 82   
 Other income totaled $241 million in the recent quarter, up 50% from $160 million in the year-earlier quarter. That improvement resulted from the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007s fourth quarter related to collateralized debt obligations held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, compared with $24 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges in the final quarter of 2008. Excluding those charges, other income was $265 million, down 8% from $288 million in the year-earlier quarter. That decline was due to a decrease of $23 million related to M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG. In addition, higher mortgage banking and brokerage services revenues in the recent quarter were offset by lower trust income and trading account and foreign exchange gains.  

 Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $447 million, compared with $445 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million in each of the final quarters of 2008 and 2007, and merger-related expenses of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $431 million in the recently completed quarter, up 4% from $415 million in the last quarter of 2007. Higher costs for salaries and occupancy, and a higher addition of $17 million to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights were the leading contributors to that rise in operating expenses, partially offset by the fourth quarter 2007 Visa litigation charge of $23 million. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007 was 57.0% and 54.3%, respectively. Table 24 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2008 and 2007.  

 Segment Information  

 In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking, and Retail Banking.  

 The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services to small businesses and professionals through the Companys branch network, business banking centers and other delivery channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and automated teller machines within markets served by the Company. Services and products offered by this segment include various business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. The Business Banking segments net income for 2008 was $120 million, down 10% from $133 million earned in 2007. That decline was mainly due to a $15 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the result of higher net loan charge-offs, and higher noninterest expenses of $12 million, reflecting higher personnel costs. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors was a $5 million increase in fees earned for providing deposit account services. This segments net income totaled $128 million in 2006. The rise in net income in 2007 as compared with 2006 was largely the result of a $15 million increase in net interest income, attributable to a 38 basis point widening of the deposit net interest margin, and higher deposit account service fees of $3 million. Those factors were partially offset by $4 million increases in each of personnel costs and the provision for credit losses.  

 83   
 The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and cash management services. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Commercial Banking segment contributed net income of $213 million, compared with $217 million in 2007. Factors contributing to the slight decline in net income included a $65 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and higher noninterest expenses of $22 million, largely the result of increased personnel costs. Those increased costs were offset, in part, by a $51 million rise in net interest income, primarily the result of a $2.0 billion increase in average loan balances outstanding, and a $28 million increase in noninterest income resulting from higher fees of $14 million for providing credit-related services, a $9 million increase in deposit service fees, and a $3 million increase in income from providing credit card and merchant-related services. This segment recorded net income of $214 million in 2006. The improvement in 2007 as compared with 2006 was due to higher net interest income of $9 million, attributable to a $875 million increase in average loan balances outstanding, offset, in part, by a 33 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, and increased fee income received for providing corporate advisory and loan syndication services of $5 million and $2 million, respectively. Largely offsetting those favorable factors were a $6 million rise in the provision for credit losses, mainly attributable to loan growth, and higher personnel costs of $5 million.  

 The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. The Commercial Real Estate segment recorded net income of $164 million in 2008, up 11% from $148 million in 2007. That improvement resulted primarily from a $31 million increase in net interest income, largely due to a $1.8 billion increase in average loan balances outstanding and higher average deposit balances of $189 million, and a $13 million increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues. Those positive factors were offset, in part, by an $11 million increase in the provision for credit losses, mainly due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and an increase in personnel costs of $10 million, due largely to higher incentive compensation related to increased volumes of commercial real estate loans. Net income in 2006 for the Commercial Real Estate segment aggregated $147 million. As compared with 2006, a rise in net interest income in 2007 of $8 million was largely offset by a higher provision for credit losses of $5 million and a $2 million increase in personnel costs. The higher net interest income resulted from a $504 million increase in average loan balances outstanding, net of a 10 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin associated with such balances.  

 The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans, and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the investment securities for which the Company has recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges in each of the last two years and the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans that were transferred to this segment in 2007. Prior to that transfer, such loans were included in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Discretionary Portfolio segment incurred net losses of $48 million and $7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contributing to the higher net loss in 2008 as compared with 2007 were net losses on investment securities totaling $181 million in 2008, compared with $126 million in 2007. Included in those losses were other-than-temporary impairment charges of $182 million in 2008 and $127 million in 2007. The 2008 impairment charges include $153 million on the preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $18 million on certain private collateralized mortgage obligations and $11 million on collateralized debt obligations backed by bank trust preferred securities. The $127 million impairment charge recorded in 2007 related to collateralized debt obligations backed by sub-prime residential mortgage securities. The following factors also contributed to the higher net loss  

 84   
 recorded in 2008: a $41 million increase in the provision for credit losses, resulting largely from higher net charge-offs of Alt-A loans; higher foreclosure-related costs of $13 million; a $6 million increase in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights; and a $4 million increase in costs incurred for professional services. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors was a $55 million rise in net interest income, primarily the result of a 21 basis point widening of the net interest margin on investment securities, and a 23% increase in the average balances of investment securities, reflecting purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter of 2008, the full-year impact of third quarter 2007 purchases of approximately $800 million of collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed securities, and the impact of the late-2007 and 2008 securitization transactions. Net income for this segment totaled $96 million in 2006. The main factors resulting in the unfavorable performance in 2007 as compared with 2006 was the previously mentioned $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to collateralized debt obligations, a $26 million increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily resulting from increased loan balances and higher net charge-offs of Alt-A mortgage loans, and a $13 million gain recognized in 2006 resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition.  

 The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. As already noted, in the first quarter of 2007, $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans previously included in this segments held-for-sale portfolio were transferred to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment incurred a net loss of $48 million in 2008, compared with net income of $13 million in 2007. The main factor contributing to the net loss in 2008 was the continued deterioration of the residential real estate market, including the valuation of residential real estate, which resulted in a $100 million increase to this segments provision for credit losses that was attributable predominately to a significant rise in net charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties. Also contributing to the unfavorable performance of this segment was a $15 million decrease in net interest income, largely due to lower average loan balances outstanding of $369 million and a 17 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin associated with such loans, and a $10 million current year addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights, compared with a $4 million reduction of such allowance in 2007. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors was a $25 million increase in noninterest revenues from residential mortgage banking activities, largely due to the impact of the $18 million loss recorded in 2007 related to Alt-A mortgage loans and higher servicing revenues of $8 million in 2008. Net income earned by the Residential Mortgage Banking segment in 2007 was 74% lower than the $52 million recorded in 2006. That decline was primarily due to the significant deterioration of the residential real estate market during 2007 which resulted in a $36 million decrease in residential mortgage banking revenues earned by this segment. Contributing to the lower mortgage banking revenues were lower gains from residential mortgage loan origination and sales activities of $28 million, predominantly resulting from slimmer margins realized due to changes in market conditions, and the previously mentioned $18 million loss recognized in 2007 related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans. Also contributing to the unfavorable performance in 2007 as compared with 2006 were a $19 million decrease in net interest income, largely due to a $451 million decline in average loan balances outstanding and a 25 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on such loans, and a lower partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $6 million. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were higher mortgage servicing revenues of $10 million.  

 The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers through several delivery channels which include branch offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail Banking segment also offers  

 85   
 certain deposit products on a nationwide basis through the delivery channels of M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), and home equity loans and lines of credit. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $250 million in 2008, 21% lower than the $316 million earned in 2007. Contributing to the unfavorable performance as compared with 2007 were increases in: the provision for credit losses of $38 million, due to higher net charge-offs of loans; personnel costs of $22 million, reflecting merit increases and the impact of the late-2007 acquisitions; net occupancy expenses of $12 million, largely the result of the 2007 acquisitions; and higher advertising and promotion costs of $6 million. Another contributing factor in the decline in net contribution was lower net interest income of $19 million, largely due to the narrowing of the net interest margins on deposits and loans of 34 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, offset, in part, by the impact of higher average deposit and loan balances of $1.5 billion and $979 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $282 million. The 12% improvement in 2007 as compared with 2006 resulted from a $60 million increase in net interest income, primarily the result of a 30 basis point increase in the deposit net interest margin, and higher service charges on deposit accounts of $25 million. Partially offsetting those factors was a $20 million increase in the provision for credit losses, resulting from higher average loan balances outstanding and net charge-offs, and a $4 million increase in noninterest expenses, largely due to higher processing costs related to debit card transactions.  

 The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions; M&Ts equity in the earnings or losses of BLG; merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions; and the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $95 million, $167 million and $80 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The lower net loss in 2008 as compared with 2007 resulted from several factors, including a $40 million reduction of income tax expense relating to the Companys resolution in 2008 of certain tax issues related to its activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007; the previously mentioned $33 million gain realized in the first quarter of 2008 from the mandatory partial redemption of Visa stock; the impact from the $23 million accrual recorded in the final quarter of 2007 related to Visa litigation and the subsequent $15 million partial reversal of such accrual in the first quarter of 2008; lower merger-related costs associated with the 2007 acquisition transactions of $11 million; and the favorable impact from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a $32 million after-tax reduction of the contribution from M&Ts investment in BLG, inclusive of interest expense to fund that investment, in 2008, compared with a similar $4 million reduction in 2007; higher personnel and professional services costs of $15 million and $11 million, respectively, related to the business and support units included in the All Other category; and a $6 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation. The higher net loss experienced in 2007 as compared with 2006 resulted from the unfavorable impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses; the previously discussed $23 million charge related to Visa litigation; increases in personnel and professional services costs of $19 million and $12 million, respectively, related to the business and support units included in the All Other category; $15 million of merger-related expenses in 2007 associated with the fourth quarter acquisition transactions, compared with $5 million in 2006 for that years June branch acquisition; a $4 million reduction of net income resulting from M&Ts investment in BLG (inclusive of interest expense to fund that investment); and a higher charge for the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The $18 million contribution made to The M&T Charitable  

 86   
 Foundation in 2006 partially offset those unfavorable factors. There were no contributions to that foundation in 2007.  

 Recent Accounting Developments  

 Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurements of certain of its financial instruments. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 that pertain to measurement of non-financial assets and liabilities have been deferred by the FASB until 2009. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The definition of fair value is clarified by SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. At December 31, 2008, approximately $2.5 billion or 29% of the Companys $8.7 billion of assets and liabilities measured using fair value measurements on a recurring basis were classified as Level 3 valuations. The Level 3 classified assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of available-for-sale privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Such securities have been classified as a Level 3 valuation because of limited trading activities and less observable valuation inputs. Fair valuation losses on Level 3 available-for-sale investment securities of $420 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008 as a reduction of other comprehensive income, with $24 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized through earnings. As previously disclosed, with the exception of certain securities for which the Company recognized a $182 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2008, as of December 31, 2008 the Company believed that it was not probable that it would be unable to collect all principal and interest payments on its portfolio of investment securities and, therefore, the Company believed that the unrealized losses on those securities were temporary. Nevertheless, as previously noted, the Company closely monitors the repayment performance of investment securities and underlying collateral on a regular basis and as a result of such monitoring it is possible that additional investment securities could be identified as other-than-temporarily impaired in future periods.  

 As a result of market inactivity and a lack of observable valuation inputs, approximately $2.2 billion of privately issued mortgage-backed securities in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were transferred out of a Level 2 classification and into a Level 3 classification during the third quarter of 2008. Offsetting the transfer into Level 3 were certain privately issued mortgage-backed securities of Bayview Financial with a fair value of $298 million that were transferred from the Companys available-for-sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2008, and thus are no longer measured at fair value. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP 157-3). FSP 157-3 was intended to clarify the application of SFAS No. 157 and provides an example to illustrate considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP 157-3 allows for the use of the reporting entitys own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs are not available to determine the fair value for a financial asset in a dislocated market. The Company considered the guidance provided by FSP 157-3 in its determination of the fair value of its portfolio of privately issued mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2008. Additionally, at that date commitments to originate mortgage loans for sale with a net fair value gain of $8 million have been classified as a Level 3 valuation. Approximately $31 million of fair value changes on commitments to originate mortgage loans for sale were recognized in mortgage banking revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008. Upon loan origination, the fair value of the derivative loan commitments becomes part of the basis of the closed loans held for sale. Approximately $26 million of fair value was transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 classification to reflect the closing of commitments into originated loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2008. Information concerning fair value measurements and the Companys approach to and classification of such measurements is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 87   
 In December 2007, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS No. 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control. SFAS No. 141R retains the guidance in SFAS No. 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. With limited exceptions, the statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair value as of that date. That replaces SFAS No. 141s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. As a result, certain acquisition-related costs previously included in the cost of an acquisition will be required to be expensed as incurred. In addition, certain restructuring costs previously recognized as if they were an assumed liability from an acquisition will be required to be expensed. SFAS No. 141R also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. SFAS No. 141R also requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values. An acquirer is required to recognize assets or liabilities arising from noncontractual contingencies as of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values, only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements. SFAS No. 141R requires an acquirer to recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as a residual, which in most types of business combinations will result in measuring goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. SFAS No. 141R also eliminates the recognition of a separate valuation allowance, such as an allowance for credit losses, as of the acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows should be included in the fair value measurement of those assets. SFAS No. 141R should be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will significantly impact its accounting for any acquisitions it may consummate in 2009 and beyond, including its announced transaction to acquire Provident in a stock-for-stock transaction expected to close during the second quarter of 2009.  

 Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. A noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is a portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. SFAS No. 160 requires that the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest is required to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 160 also requires entities to provide disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of a fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a significant impact on the reporting of its financial position or results of its operations.  

 In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 140-3, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities (FSP 140-3). FSP 140-3 was issued to provide guidance on accounting for a transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing. FSP 140-3 presumes that an initial transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing are considered part of the same arrangement (linked transaction) under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. However, if certain criteria are met, the initial  

 88   
 transfer and repurchase financing should not be evaluated as a linked transaction and should be evaluated separately under SFAS No. 140. FSP 140-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is not permitted. FSP 140-3 should be applied prospectively to initial transfers and repurchase financings for which the initial transfer is executed on or after the beginning of the fiscal year for which FSP 140-3 is effective. The Company does not believe that the adoption of FSP 140-3 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

 The FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in March 2008. SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities including (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedging items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with earlier application encouraged. The Company intends to comply with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 161.  

 In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP 132R-1). FSP 132R-1 was issued to provide guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. FSP 132R-1 requires an employer to disclose information about how investment allocation decisions are made, including factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. An employer will also need to disclose separately for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the fair value of each major category of plan assets based on the nature and risks of the assets as of each annual reporting date for which a statement of financial position is presented. FSP 132R-1 also requires the disclosure of information that enables financial statement users to assess the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets at the annual reporting date. For fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), an employer will be required to disclose the effect of the measurements on changes in plan assets for the period. Furthermore, an employer is required to provide financial statement users with an understanding of significant concentrations of risk in plan assets. FSP 132R-1 should be applied for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions of FSP 132R-1 are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the provisions of FSP 132R-1 and intends to comply with its disclosure requirements.  

 In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20 (FSP 99-20-1). FSP 99-20-1 amends the impairment guidance in EITF Issue No. 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets. The FASB stated that the objective of FSP 99-20-1 was to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. An entity with beneficial interests within the scope of FSP 99-20-1 is no longer required to solely consider market participant assumptions when evaluating cash flows for an adverse change that would be indicative of other-than-temporary impairment. FSP 99-20-1 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other-than-temporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and other related guidance. FSP 99-20-1 should be applied prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008. Retrospective application to a prior interim or annual reporting period is not permitted. The Company has complied with the provisions of FSP 99-20-1, which had no incremental impact on its results of operations or financial position as of December 31, 2008.  

 In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP 03-6-1). FSP 03-6-1 was issued to specify that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP 03-6-1 is  

 89   
 effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those years. In January 2009, the Company issued a significant portion of its annual stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units, which are considered participating securities under FSP 03-6-1. Beginning for the quarter ending March 31, 2009, the Companys earnings per share will be presented using the two-class method.  

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management.
