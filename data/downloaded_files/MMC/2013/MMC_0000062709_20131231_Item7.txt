Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions principally in the areas of risk, strategy and human capital. It is the parent company of a number of the world’s leading risk experts and specialty consultants, including: Marsh, the insurance broker, intermediary and risk advisor; Guy Carpenter, the risk and reinsurance specialist; Mercer, the provider of HR and related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, the management, economic and brand consultancy. With approximately 55,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue of over $12 billion, the Company provides analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 130 countries.

The Company conducts business through two segments:

•Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services. We conduct business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

•Consulting includes Health, Retirement, Talent and Investments consulting and services and products, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.

We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.

This Management's Discussion & Analysis ("MD&A") contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report.

Consolidated Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consolidated operating income increased 14% to $2.1 billion in 2013 compared with $1.8 billion in 2012 driven by a 3% increase in revenue on both a reported and underlying basis, with growth in each operating company. Expenses increased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis as the Company continues its efforts to manage expenses and improve operating efficiency. 

Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $87 million or 7% in 2013 compared with 2012. Revenue increased 4%, or 3% on an underlying basis, to $6.6 billion in 2013 reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. 

Consulting operating income increased $153 million or 22% to $845 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to the combined effects of increased revenue at Mercer and lower expenses in the segment.

Consolidated operating income in 2012 was $1.8 billion compared with $1.6 billion in 2011. 

Risk and Insurance Services operating income in 2012 increased $134 million or 11% to $1.3 billion compared with 2011, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

Consulting operating income in 2012 increased $75 million or 12% to $692 million compared with 2011, primarily due to increased revenue at Mercer and improved operating efficiency.

Discontinued operations in 2011 includes a net credit resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters and related insurance recoveries as well as the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain indemnified matters in connection with the disposals of Putnam and Kroll. These credits are partly offset by the write-off, net of tax, of capitalized software related to the disposal of the Marsh Business Processing Outsourcing ("BPO") business.

Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $1.4 billion in 2013, compared with $1.2 billion in 2012 and $993 million in 2011.

Consolidated Revenue and Expense

The Company conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of 

26

acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows:

Revenue

Consolidated revenue for 2013 increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis to $12.3 billion compared with $11.9 billion in 2012. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, or 3% on an underlying basis, with underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 2% on both a reported and underlying basis. On an underlying basis, Mercer's revenue was up 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, while the Oliver Wyman Group decreased 1%. 

Consolidated revenue for 2012 increased 3% to $11.9 billion compared with $11.5 billion in 2011, reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, a 1% increase due to acquisitions and a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011 or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 5% in Marsh and 6% in Guy Carpenter. Consulting segment revenue increased 2%, resulting from a 4% increase in Mercer partly offset by a 1% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, Consulting segment revenue increased 4%, reflecting a 4% increase in Mercer and a 3% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.

Operating Expense

Consolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2013 compared with the same period in 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and pension costs, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims. 

Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. The increase reflects a 3% increase in underlying expenses, a 1% increase due to the impact of acquisitions, offset by a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and benefits costs as well as restructuring costs at Mercer, which include exit costs related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business. These increases were partly offset by credits related to the adjustment of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities.

Restructuring

In 2013, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $22 million. The restructuring costs consist primarily of severance and benefits, costs for future rent and other real estate costs. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$7 million; Consulting—$2 million; and Corporate—$13 million. 

Businesses Exited

In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business, which was completed in August 2012. Marsh's BPO business was previously part of the Marsh U.S. Consumer business and provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011. 

Risk and Insurance Services

In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of 

29

the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required, and service provided by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. 

Marsh also receives compensation from insurance companies. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions in parts of its operations. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A. 

The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4%, or 3% on an underlying basis, in 2013 compared with 2012. 

In Marsh, revenue grew to $5.4 billion in 2013, an increase of 4% from the prior year, reflecting 3% growth in underlying revenue and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 3% reflects growth in all major geographies which was driven by increased new business. International operations had underlying revenue growth of 4% reflecting increases of 13% in Latin America, 5% in Asia Pacific and 3% in EMEA, while U.S. / Canada increased 2%.

The Risk and Insurance segment completed six acquisitions during 2013.

•June - MMA acquired Progressive Benefits Solutions, an employee benefits agency based in North Carolina, and Security Insurance Services, Inc., a Wisconsin-based insurance agency which offers property/casualty and employee benefits products and services to individuals and businesses. 

•August - MMA acquired Rosenfeld-Einstein, a South Carolina-based employee benefits service provider, and Eidson Insurance, a property/casualty and employee benefits services firm located in Florida. 

•October - MMA acquired Howalt+McDowell, a South Dakota-based agency which offers property/ casualty, surety, personal protection and employee benefits insurance to individuals and businesses, and The Protector Group Insurance Agency, a Massachusetts-based agency which provides property/casualty, employee benefits services, personal insurance and individual financial services. 

•November - MMA acquired Brower Insurance, an Ohio-based company providing employee benefits, property/casualty and consulting services.

•December - MMA acquired McGraw Wentworth, a Michigan-based company providing consulting services to mid-sized organizations, and Liscomb Hood Mason, a Minnesota-based company providing property/casualty and employee benefits products and services.

The MMA acquisitions were made to expand Marsh's presence in the U.S. middle-market business.

Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 5% to $1.1 billion in 2013 compared with 2012, or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting growth across North America, International, Global Specialites and U.K. Facultative.

In July 2013, Guy Carpenter acquired Smith Group, a specialist disability reinsurance risk manager and consultant based in Maine.

Fiduciary interest income was $27 million in 2013 compared to $39 million in 2012 due to lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.

Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.

In Marsh, revenue in 2012 was $5.2 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year, reflecting 5% growth in underlying revenue and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 2% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 5% reflects growth in all major geographies, driven by new business. Underlying revenue increased 13% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific, 3% in U.S. / Canada and 5% in EMEA.

Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 4% to $1.1 billion in 2012 compared with 2011, or 6% on an underlying basis, driven by Guy Carpenter's International operations, particularly Global Specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA, Latin America, and Global Facultative. 

31

Fiduciary interest income was $39 million in 2012 compared to $47 million in 2011 due to slightly lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.

Expense

Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis in 2013 compared with 2012. The increase in expenses on an underlying basis is primarily due to higher base salaries, pension costs and adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims.

Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting a 2% increase from acquisitions and a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis increased 3% primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs partly offset by credits related to adjustments to acquisition- related contingent consideration liabilities.

Consulting

The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.

The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s delegated investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management and/or administration.

Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. 

Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to investment management are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.

The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

Consulting revenue in 2013 increased 2% compared with 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 2% reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, partly offset by a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by Health and Investments, which increased 6% and 9%, respectively. Oliver Wyman’s revenue was flat in 2013 compared to 2012, as a 1% decrease in underlying revenue was offset by a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency. 

32

The Consulting segment completed two acquisitions during 2013.

•July - Oliver Wyman acquired Corven, a U.K.-based management consultancy firm.

•August - Mercer acquired Global Remuneration Solutions, a market leading compensation consulting firm based in South Africa.

Consulting revenue in 2012 increased 2% compared with 2011, or 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.1 billion in 2012, an increase of 4% on both a reported and underlying basis compared with 2011, with growth in each of its businesses. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% increases in both health and investments. Oliver Wyman’s revenue decreased 1% in 2012 compared to 2011, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. 

During 2012, Mercer completed the following three acquisitions: 

•February - Mercer acquired the remaining 49% of Yokogawa-ORC, a global mobility firm based in Japan, which was previously accounted for under the equity method, and Pensjon & Finans, a leading Norway-based financial investment and pension consulting firm. 

•March - Mercer acquired REPCA, a France-based broking and advisory firm for employer health and benefits plans. 

Expense

Consulting expenses in 2013 decreased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis compared to 2012. This decrease reflects the impact of lower restructuring costs and continued strong expense control.

Consulting expenses in 2012 increased 1%, or 2% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher benefits and restructuring costs, including charges of $16 million for the exit activities related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business.

Corporate and Other

The following results of Corporate and Other includes the run-off of Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group ("CARG") operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate expenses in 2013 were $190 million compared to $203 million in 2012. The decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of equity awards and lower severance, partially offset by higher pension expense. 

Corporate expenses in 2012 were $203 million compared to $188 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to accelerated amortization of equity awards for retirement eligible senior executives and higher consulting costs associated with corporate initiatives. 

The CARG amounts reflect payments received related to the CARG businesses divested in 2008.

Discontinued Operations

As part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2013 includes estimated costs covered under the indemnity related to the Kroll sale as well as tax indemnities related to the Putnam sale. Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits of $50 million from the resolution of certain legal matters 

33

and insurance recoveries, as well as the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters, primarily with respect to Putnam.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business which was completed in August 2012. Marsh's BPO business, previously part of Marsh U.S. Consumer business, provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011. 

Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other Corporate Items

Interest

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $18 million in 2013 compared with $24 million in 2012. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $167 million in 2013 compared with $181 million in 2012. The decrease is due to lower average debt balances in 2013 and lower interest rates on senior notes issued in 2013 compared with the interest rates on senior notes that matured or were extinguished during 2013.

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $24 million in 2012 compared with $28 million in 2011. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $181 million in 2012 compared with $199 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on senior notes issued during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, compared with the interest rate on notes that matured.

Cost of Extinguishment of Debt

On October 24, 2013, the Company purchased $250 million of its 2015 Notes. The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a make whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a cost of approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.

On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes, comprising $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes. The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a tender premium, which exceeded the carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately $72 million in the third quarter of 2011.

Investment Income (Loss)

The caption “Investment income” in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of debt and available for sale securities and the change in value of the Company's holdings in certain private equity funds, including equity method gains 

34

(losses) on its investment in the Trident funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded gains on its investment in Trident II of $22 million and $35 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, including $15 million of deferred performance fees recognized in the first quarter of 2013. Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and made final distributions to its partners during the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company has now recognized all of the performance fees related to its general partnership interest in Trident II. Investment income for 2013 includes performance fees of $40 million related to the Company's general partnership interest in Trident III which had been deferred, but are no longer subject to claw back. Trident III is a private equity fund created in 2003. Prior to 2013, no Trident III-related investment income had been recognized since 2006, when MMC contributed its limited partnership investment interest to its U.K. pension plan. At December 31, 2013, the Company had deferred performance fees of approximately $38 million related to Trident III. Recognition of these deferred performance fees will only occur as investments are harvested and the performance fees are no longer subject to claw back. Timing of this is unknown and is not controlled by the Company.

In 2012, investment income was $24 million compared with $9 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments, partly offset by an impairment loss on a debt security of $8 million.

Income Taxes

The Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 30.1%, 29.0% and 30.1% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. 

The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings. In 2013, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia, France and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 21% (excluding the non-cash deferred tax impact of U.K. tax legislation enacted in 2013), 27%, 31%, 42% and 0%, respectively. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%. 

The Company's U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 45% of total revenue, while over that period the pre-tax income from U.S. locations varied from 9% to 21% of total pre-tax income. 

As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.

The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable in the U.S. and globally. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company's domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, 

35

the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the profitability of the Company's U.S. operations throughout the period 2011 to 2013, (ii) the nature, frequency, and severity of losses incurred before 2011, (iii) profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the Company's and Marsh's operating performance, (iv) the non-recurring nature of some of the items that contributed to losses before 2011, (v) the carry-forward periods for the net operating losses ("NOLs") and foreign tax credit carry-forwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that most of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $195 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the Company's profitable global operations, consistent with the Company's historical practice. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, for share repurchases and for corporate expenses. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.

The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. At the current time, the Company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash. The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes approximately $190 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change, management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future.

Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.

Operating Cash Flows

The Company generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations in both 2013 and 2012. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash 

36

charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets.

During 2013, the Company contributed $26 million to its U.S. pension plans and $620 million to non-U.S. pension plans, which included contributions of $250 million to pre-fund all of the 2014 and a substantial portion of the 2015 deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans and a discretionary contribution of $70 million to the Canadian plans. In 2012, the Company contributed $124 million to U.S. plans and $389 million to non-U.S. plans, which included $100 million of discretionary contributions to each of the U.S. and the U.K. plans.

In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. The pension stabilization provisions included in the "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act", enacted on July 6, 2012, changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under ERISA, which determines, in part, the funding requirements. After considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above, the Company expects less than $1 million of contributions will be required for its U.S. tax-qualified plan through the end of 2014. The Company also expects to fund approximately $24 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2014.

The Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 82% of non-U.S. plan assets. Contribution rates for non-US plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' Trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP. The current funding plan was based on assumptions (including interest rates, inflation, salary increases and mortality) that reflected market conditions as of year-end 2009, was agreed to in early 2011 and formed the basis for the Company's aggregate contributions to the U.K. plans for 2011 through 2013. In 2013, the Company made required contributions of $300 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, including amounts called for under the U.K. funding plan. Additionally, the Company made a $250 million contribution to pre-fund certain deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans, described above, and a $70 million discretionary contribution to its Canadian plans. The valuation of the U.K. pension plan at December 31, 2012 that results from the negotiation process described above will determine funding that is expected to become applicable in 2014. Contributions to the U.K. plans typically comprised of a portion related to the current service cost, that is, the benefits earned by employees in the current year, plus an amount intended to reduce, over time, any deficit determined through the Company's negotiations with the Trustee. In the aggregate, the Company expects to fund approximately $160 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2014, comprising approximately $90 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $70 million to the U.K. plans. 

Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan.

After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January 2014, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans, to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1, 2014 and will replace those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement. As required under GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. As a result of the re-measurement, the Projected Benefit Obligation ("PBO") increased by approximately $147 million and the funded status decreased by approximately $137 million. The change in the PBO and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the re-measurement date. The net periodic benefit costs recognized in 2014 will be the weighted average resulting from the December 31, 2013 measurement and the January 2014 re-measurement. The Company will recognize a curtailment gain of $63 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily resulting 

37

from the recognition of the remaining prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in December 2012. This gain will be mostly offset by a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment. As a result of the amendments to the U.K. plans, the Company expects an increase in contributions to its defined contribution plans of approximately $30 million related to the transfer of colleagues from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, and funding of a portion of the transition benefit.

The year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2013 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.9 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of increases in the discount rates, actual returns on plan assets in 2013 that were higher than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and discretionary contributions to the plans, discussed above. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities increased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's two largest plans) in 2013 after decreasing in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012. At the end of 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.0%, declining to 5.6%, 4.9% and 4.4% at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. In 2013 the weighted average discount rate increased to 4.8%. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2013, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 12.6% and 8.6% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2012, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 14.1%, and 9.8% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively; and in 2011, the actual returns were 5.8% in the U.S. and 4.8% in the U.K. In 2012 and 2010, actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year. In 2011, both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses.

Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2013, the Company’s pension expense was expected to decrease in 2014 by approximately $128 million, partly offset by compensation considerations. Approximately 85% of this decrease relates to the U.S. plans. The decrease in the expected U.S. pension expense results primarily from an increase in the discount rates used to measure U.S. plan liabilities along with the impact of an increase in plan assets at the end of 2013 resulting from investment returns. The remainder of the decrease relates to plans outside of the U.S. resulting from a modest increase in the discount rate and an increase in plan assets resulting from both asset performance and contributions. 

As a result of the plan remeasurement to reflect the amendments to the U.K. plans, described above, an incremental decrease of approximately $31 million for defined benefit pension expense is expected for 2014, primarily resulting from the elimination of the service cost component, effective August 1, 2014. However, the decrease in the defined benefit pension cost resulting from the amendment will be largely offset by increased cost for the new defined contribution plan which will replace the existing defined benefit plans in the U.K.

The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Other

The Company received $322 million in cash refunds of U.S. federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011, comprising $212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the sale of Kroll and various other assets, and $110 million from the cash settlement of the IRS audit for the periods 2006 through 2008. The audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims 

38

for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008. The impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011.

Financing Cash Flows

Net cash used for financing activities was $834 million in 2013 compared with $633 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2012. The Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $37 million in 2013 while outstanding debt decreased by $10 million and $100 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Debt

In September 2013, the Company issued $250 million of 2.55% five-year senior notes and $250 million of 4.05% ten-year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included a partial redemption of $250 million of the outstanding principal amount of the existing 5.75% senior notes due 2015. The redemption settled in October 2013 with a total cash outflow of approximately $275 million, including a $24 million cost for early redemption based on the terms of the original indenture.

During the first quarter of 2013, the Company used cash to repay its 4.85% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. 

During the first quarter of 2012, the Company repaid its 6.25% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 2.3% five-year $250 million senior notes in the first quarter to repay the maturing notes.

On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes comprising $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the "Notes"). The Company acquired the Notes at fair value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value. A cost of approximately $72 million was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2011 related to the extinguishment of this debt.

The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 4.80% ten-year $500 million senior notes in the third quarter of 2011 and cash on hand to purchase the Notes.

Acquisitions

During 2013, the Company paid $17 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The portion of these payments that are reflected as a financing activity is $9 million, which represents payments related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition. Any payments made related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as operating cash flows, which in 2013 was $8 million. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $104 million for acquisitions completed in 2013 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013. 

During 2012, the Company paid $30 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods.

In the second quarter of 2011, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority-owned entity for total cash consideration of $8 million.

In the first quarter of 2011, the Company paid deferred purchase consideration of $13 million related to the purchase in 2009 of the minority interest of a previously controlled entity. 

39

Credit Facilities

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a $1.0 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2013.

In December 2012, the Company closed on a $50 million, 3-year delayed draw term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. The facility requires the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed above. The Company had $50 million of borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2013. 

The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and A- by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a positive outlook from Moody’s and a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s.

The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $282 million at December 31, 2013 and $247 million at December 31, 2012. There was $1 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2013 and no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2012.

Share Repurchases

In May 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion of the Company's common stock. During 2013, the Company repurchased 13.2 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $550 million at an average price per share of $41.76. The Company remains authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $563 million.  There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $230 million at an average price per share of $33.36.

Dividends

The Company paid total dividends of $533 million in 2013 ($0.96 per share), $497 million in 2012 ($0.90 per share) and $480 million in 2011 ($0.86 per share).

Investing Cash Flows

Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $446 million in 2013 compared with $583 million used for investing activities in 2012. The Company made eight acquisitions in 2013. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $125 million. In addition, in 2013, the Company paid $15 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $2 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $44 million for acquisitions completed in 2013 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013. 

The Company made 15 acquisitions in 2012. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $230 million. In addition, in 2012, the Company paid $59 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $3 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. 

The Company received proceeds from distributions on its Investment in Trident II of $100 million, $35 million and $61 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and final distributions were made to partners during the fourth quarter of 2013. 

The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $401 million in 2013 and $320 million in 2012, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. 

The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $25 million in two private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. 

40

Commitments and Obligations

The following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2013:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $128 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $7 million that may become payable during 2014. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 15 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $900 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2014, the Company expects to contribute approximately $25 million and $160 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. 

Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Legal and Other Loss Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions. GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.

41

Retirement Benefits

The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.

The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees. 

The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the Company expects pension expense in 2014 to decrease approximately $128 million compared with 2013, partly offset by compensation considerations.

Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.

The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

The Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, 

42

regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.

Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.

Fair Value Determinations

Goodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In 2013, the Company elected to not use the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a step 1 impairment test was necessary and instead elected to perform a step 1 impairment test. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or discounted cash flow model. This fair value determination was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. 

The Company completed its 2013 annual review in the third quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin.

Share-based Payment

The guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans 

43

and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.2 years. Also as of December 31, 2013, there was $74 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately one year.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.
