Business Strategy  

General  

There are four major components of our business strategy:  

       A passionate focus on safety;  

       A relationship-based approach to client interactions;  

       A strong focus on cost control; and  

       An organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution.  

Acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones. Acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas.  

Safety and BeyondZero®  

Most companies in our industry try to provide their employees with a safe and secure work environment. They create safety programs, insist on employee training, and make every effort to build awareness. We do this, too, but at Jacobs we see safety differently.  

In 2007 we introduced a concept we call BeyondZero®, a Company-wide initiative designed to educate and train our employees, and to instill in them a culture of caring that follows them outside of the workplace or jobsite. BeyondZero® has inspired our organization to a deeper, richer, emotional commitment to the safety of our employees, their families, their clients, partners and friends, and beyond.  

A safe work environment is critical to our long-term success and growth. We maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes. Unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable, and increase our own operating costs as well.  

We believe that we have a responsibility to go beyond these issues. We have developed a true culture of caring where concern for our employees health and safety extends past office walls, beyond the field, and past the perception that injured employees simply cost the Company time and money. Its about safekeeping.  

Safe job sites and office environments benefit our clients, promote employee morale, and enhance the long-term relationships we have with our clients, employees, and business partners.

Relationship-Based Business Model  

Our relationship-based business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability. We aggressively pursue the development of long-term affiliations and alliances with our clients. By working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs, we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects. This increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide a superior value to our clients. We market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise. By integrating and bundling our services (i.e., providing design, engineering, and construction services on the same project), we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients. Our relationship-based business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in our projects, which in turn allows us to better manage those risks. Our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post start-up and commissioning phases of a plant, such as operations and maintenance services. This model, however, does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects. We will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions.  

Closely linked to our relationship-based business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy for conducting business around the world. As part of this strategy, we act and operate as a local contractor in the geographic areas of the world in which we do business. We believe it is important for us as a company to be local with respect to our network of offices and operations. Because our offices can generally sustain themselves with a base load of local work, were able to support our multinational clients with their cross-border capital projects. Our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world. Our multidomestic strategy also allows us to be competitive around the world to the extent we win large projects and are able to perform meaningful portions of the project utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices within the group.  

Cost Control  

Our continual emphasis on cost control is an important component of our business model. As the global economy expands and companies providing technical, professional, and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries, the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage. Our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical, professional, and construction services safely, efficiently, and within the cost and time parameters our clients require.  

Organizational Structure  

Our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services is another key component of our business strategy. Our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering, design, and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute long-term engineering and construction contracts. Crucial functions, such as project controls and procurement, are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects. In addition, we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients. We do not maintain profit centers within the Company, nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts. Instead, our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively, while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services.  

The Role of Acquisitions in Our Business Strategy  

Our relationship-based business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy. When we review potential acquisition targets, we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base. We favor  

5  

Table of Contents 

 acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients, and/or gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand. By expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities, we strive to position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of technical, professional, and construction services to our major clients. The following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions:  

       In April 2007, we acquired Edwards and Kelcey, Inc. (Edwards and Kelcey). Edwards and Kelcey was a nationally recognized engineering, design, planning, and construction management firm serving public and private clients in the fields of transportation; planning/environmental; communications technology; buildings/facilities; and land development. Headquartered in Morristown, New Jersey, Edwards and Kelcey employed approximately 1,000 people in offices located primarily in the Northeastern region of the United States (U.S.). The primary purpose for acquiring Edwards and Kelcey was to expand our infrastructure business in the U.S.  

       In November 2007, we acquired Carter & Burgess, Inc. (Carter & Burgess). Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Carter & Burgess was an approximately 3,200-person professional services firm providing architecture, engineering, design, and planning services to public and private sector clients operating in the fields of transportation, water, infrastructure programs, building programs, land development, and planning. The primary purpose for acquiring Carter & Burgess was to expand our infrastructure and facilities business in the U.S.  

       In March 2008 we acquired a 60% interest in Zamel & Turbag Consulting Engineers (Zate). Located in Saudi Arabia, Zate was an approximately 500-person professional services firm providing engineering and construction management services to clients operating in the oil & gas, refining, and chemicals industries. The primary purpose for acquiring Zate was to expand our business in the Middle East with clients operating in those industries in the Middle East.  

In any particular year, we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise.  

Services Provided  

As described above, the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories: Project Services; Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting services; Construction services; and Operations and Maintenance services. The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, range from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single-responsibility, design-build-operate contracts.  

The following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years (in thousands of dollars):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Project Services  

We employ all of the engineering, design, architectural, and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants (including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; oil & gas; refining; food and consumer products; and basic resources industries); buildings  

6  

Table of Contents 

 (including facilities for clients in the health care; education; and criminal justice markets, as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector); infrastructure projects (including highways, roads, bridges, and other transportation systems; water and wastewater treatment plants; water resources facilities; and other similar plants and facilities); technology and manufacturing facilities (for clients in the aerospace; automotive; defense; semiconductor; and electronics industries); consumer products manufacturing facilities; pulp and paper plants; and other facilities. We also employ many of the requisite scientific, technical, and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration, testing, and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries; for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers; for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for aerospace, testing, and propulsion systems and facilities; and for various other agencies of the U.S. federal government in support of environmental programs.  

We are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design. Through safety in design we integrate best practices, hazard analysis, and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects, taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction, start-up, testing and commissioning, and operations phases of a project.  

In the area of construction management, we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients. We may act as the program director, whereby we oversee, on the owners behalf, the complete planning, design, and construction phases of the project. Alternatively, our services may be limited to providing construction consulting.  

Also included in the category of Project Services are certain related services (such as planning, scheduling, procurement, estimating, cost engineering, project accounting, and quality and safety) necessary to support our engineering, design, construction, construction and program management, operations and maintenance, and consulting services.  

Process, Scientific and Systems Consulting  

We employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including: performing pricing studies, market analyses, and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project; performing gasoline reformulation modeling; analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants; analyzing automation and control systems; analyzing, designing, and executing biocontainment strategies; developing and performing process protocols with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated qualification and validation requirements; providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects; and performing geological and metallurgical studies.  

Also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients (such as the U.S. federal government and its agencies) in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs. Such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide, and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems; weapons modeling and simulations; computer systems development, maintenance, and support; evaluation and testing of mission-critical control systems; and other highly technical programs and tasks.  

Construction  

We provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services. In the area of environmental remediation and restoration, we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients. We also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology. Our modular construction  

7  

Table of Contents 

 technology is an advanced form of engineering and design, off-site fabrication and assembly, and field erection. It provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction, which can compress and shorten the construction schedule, reduce risk, and lower costs.  

Historically, our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work. By focusing our construction efforts on such projects, we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties. The financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixed-price contracts; therefore, we generally avoid this type of project. However, we will pursue construction-only projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which results in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume.  

Operations and Maintenance (O&M)  

O&M generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients. We can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility, including managing subcontractors and other on-site personnel. Within the environmental area, O&M often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites. Within the aerospace and defense areas, O&M often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities, weapons integration facilities, and high-tech simulation and verification centers. Such O&M contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services; utilities operations and maintenance services; property management and disposition services; and construction support services.  

O&M also includes process plant maintenance services, which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant (typically a refinery or chemical plant) in day-to-day operation. Such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps, piping, heat exchangers, and other equipment as well as turnaround work, which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down. Since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant, turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a 24-hours-per-day, seven-days-per-week basis. We use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly, and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects.  

Although the gross profit margins that we realize from O&M services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide, the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower. Furthermore, we view O&M contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to us as compared to some of the other services we provide because O&M contracts are normally cost-reimbursable in nature. Additionally, although engineering and construction projects may be of a short-term nature, O&M services often result in long-term relationships with clients. For example, we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the U.S. for several decades. This aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services.  

Financial Information About Segments  

Although we describe our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in terms of the services we provide, the markets in which our clients operate, and the geographic areas in which we operate, we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In making this determination, we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including: the nature of the services we provide, the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services, and the types of customers we have. In addition to the discussion that follows, please refer to Note 14Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents 

There is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories. For example, engineering and design services (i.e., services provided by persons who are degreed, and in certain circumstances licensed, professionals such as engineers, architects, scientists, and economists) exist in all four service categories. In addition, there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and O&M projects. In providing construction and O&M services, we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel. These may include welders, pipe fitters, electricians, crane operators, and other personnel who work on very large capital projects (in the case of projects classified within the construction services category) or on smaller capital projects (in the case of maintenance projects classified within the O&M services category).  

Our operating units use a matrix organizational structure. Our results, therefore, are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines (e.g., electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, cost engineering, etc.) supporting project management personnel (who maintain the relationship between us and our clients, and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely, on time, and on budget). Additionally, all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools, policies, and procedures to manage and run their respective units. These include project review meetings, project performance evaluations, and project execution plans.  

The use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform. Whether it is PC-based computer aided design and drafting (CADD) applications used by our engineering and design staff, or PC-based modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff, or PC-based scheduling, estimating, and cost control applications used by home-office personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities, all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large.  

Furthermore, the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance, evaluate results of operations, allocate resources, and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment. Accordingly, based on these similarities, we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Industry Groups and Markets  

We provide our services to clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets: energy and refiningdownstream; long-term programs for various national governments, including the U.S.; chemicals and polymers; oil and gasupstream; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and mining and minerals). We believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources which helps to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry.  

The following table sets forth our revenues from each of the various industry groups and markets in which our clients operate for each of the last five fiscal years (in thousands of dollars):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

Energy & RefiningDownstream  

We provide full-service engineering, design, modular fabrication, construction, construction management, and asset management and maintenance services to our clients in the energy and refining industries throughout the world. We also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments, facility appraisals, feasibility studies, technology evaluations, project finance structuring and support, and multi-client subscription services. Typical projects range in size from several million dollars to multi-billion dollar facilities and include new design and construction, revamps or expansions of existing plants, turnarounds, upgrades of individual process units within refineries, and maintenance services.  

Our modular construction capabilities, asset management/maintenance services, and formal client alliances help differentiate us in this sector. Many projects involve revamping existing processing units or adding new processes to an existing refinery. As a result of the close proximity of processing units in these refineries, using modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site and can also provide safety, cost, and project execution benefits in remote locations.  

In this industry group, we also include power generation and cogeneration projects. We provide technical assistance, project management, design, engineering, procurement, construction and construction management, and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry and for power generating units within our clients process facilities. Typical projects include simple and combined cycle power projects, cogeneration power plants, aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines, and emergency power generation stations.  

Oil & GasUpstream  

We provide full-service engineering, design, construction, modular fabrication, maintenance, and construction management services to our clients in the upstream areas of oil and gas exploration and production. We also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments, facility appraisals, feasibility studies, technology evaluations, project finance structuring and support, and multi-client subscription services. Many of our upstream projects are in North America, Europe, and Saudi Arabia and include offshore platforms, heavy oil processing (e.g., oil sands thermal extraction projects); oil recovery through steam injection; and gas treating, gas gathering, and gas storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream.  

Typical projects involve the design and construction of projects that recover oil and gas and include oil thermal recovery facilities by either in-situ means (steam injection or steam assisted gravity drainage) or above-ground oil sands mining, upgraders, pipelines, and gas plants. These are typically larger projects that may involve many of our offices and normally include our Mumbai, India, office as a value-added center to reduce client costs.  

National Government Programs  

We categorize our National Government Programs as generally relating to environmental programs, aerospace and defense programs, or building programs.  

Environmental Programs  

We provide environmental investigation, restoration, engineering, construction, and site operations and maintenance services to a number of United States federal government agencies, including the Department of Energy (DoE) and the DoD. We also provide these services to support the government of the United Kingdom in its nuclear sites decommissioning program through the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA).

Table of Contents 

Our projects include hazardous and nuclear waste management and site cleanup and closurewith many of these projects for the United States federal government spanning over ten years. Our projects within this market generally relate to all major federal and state environmental statutes, with particular emphasis on the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. As part of our environmental restoration work, we provide support in such areas as underground storage tank removal, contaminated soil and water remediation, and long-term groundwater monitoring. Our environmental consulting services include air quality planning and permitting, water quality compliance, environmental conservation studies, pollution prevention assessments, and compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.  

We also design, build, install, operate, and maintain various types of soil and groundwater cleanup systems at multiple project locations across the United States and its territories for the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE). Typical projects also include the preparation of feasibility studies and performance of remedial investigations, engineering, design, and remediation services on several national programs. As an extension of our environmental support to AFCEE, we also serve AFCEEs clients with execution of capital projects involving sustainment, repair, and modernization of military facilities and infrastructure.  

As a differentiating aspect of our support to clients, we provide asset management services in the form of infrastructure operations and maintenance. This is an integral part of our services for the DoE. Asset management also includes building closures that involve deactivation, decommissioning, and demolition of government facilities.  

Aerospace and Defense Programs  

We provide support to aerodynamic, propulsion, and space facilities and systems for government clients such as the DoD and NASA at more than a dozen test centers across the continental United States and for the Ministry of Defence in the U.K. This support includes military systems acquisition management and strategic planning; operations and maintenance of test facilities, ranges, space launch facilities, and space chambers; test and evaluation in computer, laboratory, facility, and range environments; test facility computer systems instrumentation and diagnostics; and test facility design and build. We also provide systems engineering and integration of complex weapons and space systems as well as hardware and software design of complex flight and ground systems. We support and maintain enterprise information systems for government and commercial clients worldwide, ranging from the operation of complex computational networks to the development and validation of specific software applications.  

We have provided advanced technology engineering services to the DoD for more than 50 years and currently support defense programs in dozens of locations, within the United States and internationally. In addition to operating and maintaining several DoD test centers, our support includes services such as aerodynamic testing of next-generation fighter aircraft; propulsion testing for space programs; testing of the U.S. Armys next generation ground mobile weapon systems; and acquisition support for weapons systems such as air-to-air missile systems and precision guided smart weapons for high-value targets. We also support the acquisition and development of systems and equipment for Special Operations Forces as well as the development of biological, chemical, and nuclear detection and protection systems. Furthermore, we support the DoD in a number of information technology programs including network design, integration, and support; command and control technology; development and sustainment of databases and customized applications; and security solutions.  

We provide a broad range of engineering, science, and technical support services to eight NASA sites, delivering support to virtually every major space program including the International Space Station, space shuttle recertification, space observatories, aerospace transportation systems, space propulsion systems, advanced materials research, and advanced research and development activities such as protein crystal growth experiments

 for the development of new drugs and vaccines. We also provide operations and maintenance services for NASA aerospace and propulsion research test facilities. We play an integral role in ensuring that the launch vehicles and propulsion systems of the future support NASAs new exploration vision.  

Buildings Programs  

We provide a wide range of advance planning, architectural, engineering, construction management, program management, and design-build services to agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); the General Services Administration (GSA); the United States Departments of State, Treasury, Agriculture, and Defense; and the Army National Guard, among others. In the U.K., we are leading the Custodial Services project management delivery program to upgrade the U.K. prison stock and also some security-led programs such as upgrading works to the Palace of Westminster and some Regional Police Authorities.  

Typical projects include renovating and modernizing terminal radar control centers, air traffic control towers, and other facilities for the FAA; planning and design services for Internal Revenue Service offices and customer service centers nationwide; and planning, design, and program management services in connection with certain homeland security initiatives for the GSA and the Department of Homeland Security.  

We are providing planning, design, design-build construction, and program management services to the DoD on military family housing; quality of life projects; training, maintenance, and readiness facilities; and command and control centers as well as military facilities supporting the DoDs global re-basing program, the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure program, and the transformation initiatives of the various military services.  

Chemicals and Polymers  

We provide technical consulting, project finance structuring, facility appraisal, market analysis, and business consulting services as well as fully-integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and construction management services to our clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries. Our services guide and assist our chemical clients from concept to a constructed and operating chemical facility.  

The types of projects we execute for our clients in these industries include feedstock synthesis, chemical synthesis, and polymerization. This includes high-pressure processes to produce industrial chemicals and low-pressure multi-product processes to produce specialty and fine chemicals. We have extensive knowledge of, and experience with, advanced polymerization reactions and state-of-the-art, post-reactor processing techniques to help bring new products and new facilities to market quickly and economically. An area of focus, due to high feedstock costs, is gasification to produce the feeds for chemicals and fertilizers. Our involvement in these early studies positions us to help owners capitalize on return on investment opportunities by streamlining work processes and optimizing existing plant layouts for future expansions.  

Like many of our other clients, our customers in this sector focus on safety, reliability, and maintainability to keep operating costs down. To support this initiative, we apply best practices on capital and maintenance work by leveraging synergy and resources within our alliances and partnerships, which in some cases involve more than 25 chemical facilities for one owner. As these multi-site relationships increase in magnitude, the range of services we provide broadens and varies from providing on-site engineering services to completing an entire capital improvement program.  

Another important aspect of serving our clients in the chemicals and polymers business is in the area of field services. We have contracts with major chemical producers worldwide to provide construction, on-site maintenance, and turnaround activities. Many of these contracts are evergreen in nature, with relationships extending over many years due to our focus on safety, value, and client satisfaction. Like the refining industry, we provide maintenance services to our clients in the chemicals industry and have also established numerous formal alliances.

We have a long history of serving county, municipal, regional, and international airports as well as air carriers and military installations. While the industry has faced pressure over recent years, our knowledge of landside design and technology, developing sustainability (green) programs, and our depth and breadth of expertise help our airport clients streamline operations and reduce operating and maintenance costs.  

In water infrastructure programs, we help public and private sector clients develop and rehabilitate critical water resource systems. By integrating water, wastewater, air quality, and hazardous waste remediation experience we provide these clients with the comprehensive expertise needed to deliver complex programs. We provide planning, design, design-build, and program and construction management services to diverse clients that include regional wastewater treatment agencies, manufacturers and power generators, local water suppliers, and military agencies. We continue to develop water/wastewater conveyance systems and water resources management projects. We have developed micro-tunneling (trenchless technology) as a key service and successfully applied this specialized process to such projects as water and utility distribution systems and pipelines.  

Buildings   

We provide strategic consulting, planning, architectural, engineering, and project and construction management services for a diversified client base encompassing both the public and private sector throughout the United States, many parts of Europe, and the Middle East. Our full range of project management, design, and construction activities relate to institutional, government, and corporate buildings as well as other specialized facilities, including projects at many of the worlds leading medical and research centers and universities as well as unique and technically complex buildings and campuses.  

We focus our efforts and resources in markets where capital spending initiatives drive demand and where changes and advances in technology require innovative, value adding solutions. Typical projects include large, multi-year government building programs in the U.S. and Europe; major primary and secondary education capital improvement programs; state and local government courts and correctional facilities; and hospitals and health and research facilities (including projects at many of the worlds leading medical and research centers). Advancing technologies require highly-specialized buildings in the fields of medical research, nano science, biotechnology, and laser sciences, and we offer total integrated design and construction management solutions to these projects, many of which are world leaders in their function. An additional area of specialization includes the design and management of large national roll-out store and distribution center programs for the nations top publicly-traded retailers.  

Our broad range of services includes design and construction-related services for new construction as well as providing expansion, renovation, and refurbishment of existing facilities. Specialized capabilities in the industry sector include energy and power master planning, design, and commissioning services. Building types include office and corporate headquarters buildings, aviation terminals and hangars, mission-critical facilities, municipal and civic facilities, retail, mixed-use and commercial centers, private sector healthcare and education facilities, and recreation complexes including some of the most high-profile entertainment facilities.  

Of particular significance is our growing success in applying our diversified technical skill base to both public and private sector clients requiring complete program management. Such contracts typically involve providing technical, professional, and construction services over multiple years to clients with whom we have long-standing relationships and tenure of successful service, including alliance or framework programs. We also provide integrated facility management services for which we (often through joint ventures with third parties) assume full responsibility for the ongoing operation and maintenance of entire commercial or industrial complexes on behalf of the client.

Industrial and Other  

We provide a broad range of services to our technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and basic resources clients.  

Technology and Manufacturing  

We provide a broad range of project services for a variety of technology, manufacturing, and test facilities. This area includes projects involving highly complex test facilities for clients in the aerospace and automotive industries. Typical projects range from conceptual design and feasibility studies to complete design-build programs of aero-acoustic wind tunnels, engine test facilities, acoustic enclosures, transmission test stands, powertrain, environmental, emissions, altitude, and electromagnetic compatibility test facilities, in-line and end-of-line component test stands, and computer-based measurement and control systems. We are a leader in providing support to automotive manufacturers and component suppliers for the supply of testing services and the management of test assets. We also provide a range of engineering, construction, operation, and maintenance services for advanced research facilities, including facilities supporting research in fusion and fission energy, nanoscale materials, and high-powered lasers and x-rays, to support important research activities in the U.S., Europe, and the U.K.  

In addition, we provide design, engineering, procurement, construction, and construction management services for a variety of clients in the semiconductor industry. Typical projects range from on-site plant engineering and tool hook-ups to multi-million dollar state-of-the-art wafer fabrication and crystal growing facilities used to produce solar energy cells, microprocessors for computers, and other consumer electronic devices. Projects in the semiconductor industry are more complex than many other commercial facilities, requiring a greater emphasis on cleanroom and similar high-end technologies.  

Pulp and Paper  

We provide a broad range of consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, construction management, and maintenance services to our clients in the pulp and paper industry, in the United States and around the world. The pulp and paper industry has been consolidating for many years, leaving a refined client base with increased assets and highly focused market strategies. Several of the traditional pulp and paper clients are emerging as major consumer product companies. These clients have created new opportunities for us in non-traditional areas such as wall board plants and facilities that manufacture diapers and feminine care products.  

Our pulp and paper capability extends through our offices in the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, and Mexico. Typical projects for our clients in this industry range from small mill projects to complex, multi-million-dollar paper machine rebuilds, mill expansions, and the construction of new facilities.  

Pulp and paper projects encompass many areas of a mill, including pulping and bleaching, papermaking, chemical recovery, material handling, effluent treatment, and power and steam generation. In the area of papermaking, our expertise includes tissue and towel, coated and uncoated fine papers, newsprint, and linerboard. Our expertise and skill set also include the converting and packaging of paper products for distribution and consumer use. We have been instrumental in designing and installing state-of-the-art facilities for recycled fiber, de-inking, and pulp bleaching.  

A significant portion of our work is assisting our clients in their compliance with environmental regulations and standards that affect the pulp and paper industry. We monitor all of the key environmental regulations affecting our clients and offer services including compliance studies, permitting support, and design of pollution control systems. We also provide complete permitting services in support of all of our projects, including associated air modeling. In addition, we provide compliance services regarding air pollutant standards and hazardous air pollutant emission limits from industrial boilers for many of our clients.

Significant Customers  

The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last five fiscal years:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

It is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10% or more of the Companys total revenue. On occasion, however, we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which, primarily because of the amount of pass-through costs (discussed below) that is included in revenue, will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10% of total consolidated revenues. For the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 revenues earned from Motiva Enterprises LLC accounted for 12.2% of total consolidated revenues and for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2006 revenues earned from Valero Energy Corporation accounted for 10.2% of total consolidated revenues.  

Financial Information About Geographic Areas  

Selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in Note 14 Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  

Contracts  

While there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into three broad categories: cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and guaranteed maximum price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination.  

When we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement, and construction of a project or the maintenance of a clients plant or facility, we reflect the costs of materials, equipment, and subcontracts in both revenues and costs. On other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no

 associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs. The following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass-through costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years (in millions of dollars):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cost-Reimbursable Contracts  

Cost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms. The fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract; it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred; or it may be an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract. In general, we prefer cost-reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price.  

Fixed-Price Contracts  

Fixed-price contracts include both lump sum bid contracts and negotiated fixed-price contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model. Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract. Under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently exist in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us. However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts. Over the past five years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services, rather than turn-key construction.  

Guaranteed Maximum Price Contracts  

Guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost-reimbursable contracts; however, the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client. If the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price, then we will bear at least some, if not all, of the excess. In those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price, we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client. These contracts are not our preferred form of contract because we believe they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model.
