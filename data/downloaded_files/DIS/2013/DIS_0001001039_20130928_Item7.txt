CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

2013 vs. 2012

Revenues for fiscal 2013 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $45.0 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 8%, or $454 million, to $6.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) for the year increased 8% or $0.25 to $3.38.

24
Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2013 was impacted by the following:

•A $321 million charge related to the Celador litigation

•Restructuring and impairment charges totaling $214 million

•A $55 million charge for our share of expense related to the Hulu Equity Redemption

•Favorable tax adjustments related to an increase in the amount of prior-year foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and favorable tax adjustments related to pre-tax earnings in prior years totaling $207 million

•A $219 million gain on the sale of our 50% interest in ESPN STAR Sports (ESS) and gains of $33 million on the sale of certain businesses

Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2012 was impacted by the following:

•A $184 million non-cash gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV (UTV Gain)

•$79 million for the recovery of a receivable from Lehman Brothers that was written off in fiscal 2008 as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy (Lehman recovery)

•Restructuring and impairment charges totaling $100 million

•A $24 million net charge related to the refinancing of Disneyland Paris borrowings (DLP debt charge)

A summary of the impact of the items listed above on EPS is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) EPS has been adjusted for any noncontrolling interest share.

(2) See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Hulu Equity Redemption charge.

(3) Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.

Aside from the $0.07 adverse year-over-year impact of the items discussed above, the EPS increase in fiscal 2013 reflected improved performance across all of our segments, except for Studio Entertainment, along with lower net interest expense driven by lower effective interest rates. Parks and Resorts operating income growth was driven by higher average guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks, partially offset by higher operating costs. Growth at Media Networks was driven by increased MVPD fees (Affiliate Fees) due to contractual rate increases, higher advertising revenues at ESPN and ABC and higher equity earnings from AETN, partially offset by higher programming costs at ESPN and ABC primetime. Consumer Products operating income growth was due to improved merchandise licensing results and the inclusion of Lucasfilm. The improvement at Interactive was driven by the release of Disney Infinity. Lower operating income at Studio Entertainment was driven by lower unit sales in home entertainment, partially offset by increased subscription video on demand (SVOD) sales in the current year and lower film impairments.

25
2012 vs. 2011

Revenues for fiscal 2012 increased 3%, or $1.4 billion, to $42.3 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 18%, or $875 million, to $5.7 billion; and EPS for the year increased 24% to $3.13.

Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2011 included restructuring and impairment charges and gains on the sale of businesses as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Restructuring and impairment charges included an impairment of assets that had tax basis significantly in excess of book value resulting in a $47 million tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges. The gains on sales of businesses included the sale of Miramax, which had a book value that included $217 million of allocated goodwill, which is not tax deductible. Accordingly, the taxable gain on the sales of businesses exceeded the $75 million book gain resulting in tax expense of $107 million.

Aside from the $0.08 year-over-year benefit of the items discussed above, the EPS increase in fiscal 2012 reflected improved operating results across all of our operating segments. Improved results at Media Networks were driven by higher cable Affiliate Fees and advertising revenue and an increase in ABC program sales. These increases were partially offset by increased sports programming costs and lower broadcast advertising revenue. Growth at Parks and Resorts was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by higher operating costs. The increase at Studio Entertainment reflected improved results at our theatrical business driven by Marvel’s The Avengers, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs. Consumer Products growth was driven by higher merchandise licensing revenue due to the strength of Marvel properties. The increase at Interactive was driven by improved social game performance due to lower acquisition accounting impacts and improved results at our console game business.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $214 million, $100 million and $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Charges in fiscal 2013 were due to severance, contract and lease termination costs and intangible and other asset impairments. The charges include amounts incurred in connection with the acquisition of Lucasfilm. Charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily due to severance, lease termination costs and the write-off of an intellectual property asset. Charges in fiscal 2011 were due to severance costs and asset impairments. Charges in each fiscal year were largely due to organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS — 2013 vs. 2012

Below is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other expenses and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.

Our Media Networks segment generates revenue from Affiliate Fees charged to MVPDs and Network affiliated stations, advertising revenues from the sale to advertisers of time in programs for commercial announcements and other revenues, which include the sale and distribution of television programming. Significant operating expenses include programming and production costs, technical support costs, distribution costs and operating labor.

Our Parks and Resorts segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacation packages and sales and rentals of vacation club properties. Significant operating expenses include operating labor, costs of sales, repairs and maintenance, utilities, information technology and property taxes.

Our Studio Entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment, television markets, music distribution and ticket sales and licensing revenues from live entertainment events. Significant operating expenses include film cost amortization, which consists of production cost and participations and residuals expense amortization, distribution expenses and costs of sales.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Media Networks

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Affiliate Fee growth of 7% was due to an increase of 7% from higher contractual rates.

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $178 million at Cable Networks from $3,785 million to $3,963 million, and an increase of $46 million at Broadcasting from $3,914 million to $3,960 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected increases of 7% due to higher units delivered and 4% due to higher rates, partially offset by a decrease of 6% due to lower ratings. Higher advertising revenues at Broadcasting reflected increases of 5% due to higher units delivered, 4% due to higher network advertising rates and 1% due to growth in online advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 8% due to lower primetime ratings.

The increase in other revenues was due to higher program sales at Broadcasting, the inclusion of revenues from Lucasfilm and higher international program syndication fees at ESPN, partially offset by lower royalties from MVPD distribution of our programs. Higher program sales reflected increased subscription revenues from programs distributed through Hulu.com. Syndication sales were comparable to the prior year as increases driven by Scandal, Revenge, Katie and Once Upon a Time were offset by decreases from Desperate Housewives, Castle and Grey's Anatomy.

28
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $712 million from $8,991 million to $9,703 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production costs of $468 million was primarily due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, MLB and NBA rights, production costs for new X Games events, the addition of new college football rights and more episodes of original programming at the domestic Disney Channels. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $244 million driven by a shift of primetime hours from lower cost reality and primetime news to higher cost original scripted programming.

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected higher marketing costs related to the fall launch of the ABC primetime season and an increase in labor related costs.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Income from equity investees increased to $742 million in the current year from $627 million in the prior year due to an increase at AETN primarily due to higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher sales and marketing and programming costs. The increase in equity income from AETN includes the benefit from an increase in the Company's ownership interest from 42% to 50%.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 3%, or $199 million, to $6.8 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels and increased equity income from AETN, partially offset by a decrease at Broadcasting.

The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded charges of $85 million, $14 million and $3 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2013 were primarily for severance, contract settlement costs and intangible asset impairment. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily related to severance, and the charges in fiscal 2011 related to asset impairments. These charges were primarily related to organizational and cost structure initiatives. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

29
Parks and Resorts

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 9%, or $1.2 billion, to $14.1 billion due to an increase of $1.1 billion at our domestic operations and an increase of $112 million at our international operations.

Revenue growth of 10% at our domestic operations reflected a 5% increase from higher average guest spending and a 4% increase from volume. Increased guest spending was due to higher average ticket prices, food, beverage and merchandise spending, and average daily hotel room rates. Higher volume was due to park attendance growth, increased passenger cruise ship days and higher occupied room nights at Walt Disney World Resort and, to a lesser extent, at the Disneyland Resort. Higher passenger cruise ship days reflected the launch of the Disney Fantasy in March 2012, while the increase in occupied room nights at Walt Disney World Resort reflected the opening of Disney's Art of Animation Resort in May 2012. 

Revenue growth of 4% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase from higher average guest spending at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, a 1% increase from higher Tokyo Disney Resort royalty revenue and a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease from lower volume. Guest spending growth was due to higher average ticket prices, the opening of the World of Disney store in July 2012 at Disneyland Paris and higher average daily hotel room rates. Lower volume was due to a decline in attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by attendance growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.

The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.

(2)Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.31 and $1.30 for fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively.

30
Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased by $269 million from $3,825 million to $4,094 million, and cost of sales, which increased by $54 million from $1,294 million to $1,348 million.  Higher operating labor was due to new guest offerings and labor cost inflation. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volumes partially offset by a lower costs per unit mix of vacation club units, reflecting sales at the Grand Floridian, which is a higher margin property. Other operating expenses, which include maintenance, utilities, information technology and property taxes, increased due to new guest offerings, inflation, higher volumes and the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds. The business interruption insurance proceeds were collected in 2012 and relate to the impact of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan on Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant new guest offerings that drove increased operating labor and other operating expenses consisted of a full year of operating the Disney Fantasy, pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort, the expansion of Disney California Adventure and a full year of Disney's Art of Animation Resort at Walt Disney World Resort.

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to information technology spending related to MyMagic+.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Disney California Adventure, costs associated with the refurbishment of the Disney Magic and a full year of depreciation for the Disney Fantasy.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 17%, or $318 million, to $2,220 million due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts, Disney Vacation Club and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris and higher pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort.

Studio Entertainment

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Higher theatrical distribution revenues were driven by two Disney feature animation releases in the current year, Wreck-It Ralph and Planes, compared to none in the prior year. Other significant titles in release were Iron Man 3, Monsters University, Oz The Great and Powerful, The Lone Ranger and Lincoln in the current year compared to Marvel's The Avengers, Brave, John Carter and The Muppets in the prior year.

Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 19% decrease from a decline in unit sales. The decrease in unit sales was driven by the performance of Brave, Wreck-It Ralph and Iron Man 3 in the current year compared to Marvel's The Avengers, Cars 2, The Lion King Diamond Release and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides in the prior year along with lower catalog sales.

The increase in television and SVOD (TV/SVOD) distribution and other revenue was driven by domestic SVOD sales of library titles in the current year and the inclusion of Lucasfilm's special effects business.

Cost and Expenses

Operating expenses included an increase of $121 million in film cost amortization, from $1,685 million to $1,806 million, driven by more significant titles in theatrical release in the current year, including the two feature animation releases, and higher TV/SVOD revenues. Other significant titles in release included Iron Man 3, Oz The Great and Powerful, The Lone Ranger, Monsters University and Lincoln in the current year compared to Marvel's The Avengers, Brave, John Carter and The Muppets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower home entertainment unit sales and lower film impairments. Lower film impairments were due to the write-down of The Lone Ranger in the current year compared to the write-down of John Carter and higher development costs write-offs in the prior year. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold, which decreased $17 million from $1,223 million to $1,206 million driven by a decline in home entertainment unit sales, partially offset by the inclusion of Lucasfilm's special effects business in the current year.

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by two Disney feature animation releases in the current year compared to none in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment marketing.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Lucasfilm.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income decreased 8% to $661 million primarily due to lower results at our home entertainment business, partially offset by an increase in television and SVOD distribution results and lower film cost write-downs in the current year.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded charges of $18 million, $18 million and $33 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2013 were primarily for severance costs. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily due to an impairment of an intangible asset. The charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily for severance and related costs. The severance costs in fiscal 2013 and 2011 were related to organizational and cost structure initiatives. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Consumer Products

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

31
Revenues

Licensing and publishing revenues increased 10% due to increases of 8% from licensing and 2% from publishing. The increase at licensing was due to the inclusion of revenues from Lucasfilm and the performance of Disney Junior, Monsters University, Mickey and Minnie, Iron Man and Planes merchandise, partially offset by lower earned revenue from Cars and Winnie the Pooh merchandise. Merchandise Licensing growth also benefited from higher recognition of minimum guarantees and a licensee audit settlement. The increase at publishing was due to international sales of books based on Disney Channel properties and higher revenues at our English language learning centers in China.

Retail and other revenue increased 9% due to an increase at our retail business, driven by higher comparable store sales growth in North America, Japan and Europe, a new wholesale distribution business in North America, increased online sales in North America and Europe, and the benefit of store format changes in North America and Japan. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included an increase of $48 million in cost of goods sold, from $593 million to $641 million, due to higher sales at our retail business. Operating expenses also include labor, occupancy and distribution costs and increased 2% primarily due to higher labor and occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to the inclusion of Lucasfilm and higher technology development costs.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Lucasfilm.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 19% to $1,112 million due to increases at our licensing, retail and publishing businesses.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded charges totaling $49 million and $34 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were primarily due to severance costs from organizational and cost structure initiatives. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Interactive

Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The increase in game sales and subscriptions revenue was driven by an increase of 25% from higher self-published console game revenues due to the fourth quarter release of Disney Infinity and 7% due to the inclusion of Lucasfilm's interactive games business. 

32
Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by the full-year impact of an agreement that started in February 2012 at our Japan mobile business, which drove an increase in licensing revenue for handset sales and content, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included an $80 million increase in cost of sales from $252 million to $332 million and a $5 million decrease in product development costs from $331 million to $326 million. Higher cost of sales was due to the release of Disney Infinity and the inclusion of Lucasfilm. 

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was due to higher marketing costs at our console games business in connection with the release of Disney Infinity, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Segment Operating Loss

Segment operating loss decreased from $216 million to $87 million due to improved results at our console games and Japan mobile businesses.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded charges totaling $11 million, $21 million and $22 million related to Interactive for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which were primarily for severance costs from organizational and cost structure initiatives. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

NON-SEGMENT ITEMS – 2013 vs. 2012

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 12%, from $474 million to $531 million. The increase reflects higher labor costs and charitable contributions.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in interest expense was due to lower effective interest rates.

The increase in interest and investment income was due to gains on sales of investments, partially offset by higher write-downs of investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate decreased 2.3 percentage points for the year primarily due to an increase in the amount of prior-year foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States, which are subject to foreign tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate and from favorable tax adjustments related to pre-tax earnings in prior years.

33
Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $9 million to $500 million due to higher net income at ESPN. This increase was partially offset by lower income recognition at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort due to the timing of recognition of royalty and management fee expense and the impact of pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. 

The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $698 million, $626 million and $576 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2013 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.

In fiscal 2014, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease from $698 million to $320 million, including $146 million of recognition of net actuarial losses. The decrease in pension and postretirement medical costs is driven by a higher assumed discount rate. Pension and postretirement medical costs for fiscal 2013 included $458 million of recognition of net actuarial losses. The increase in the discount rate also resulted in a decrease in the underfunded status of our plans from $4.8 billion to $1.9 billion and a decrease in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $2.0 billion ($1.2 billion after tax) as of September 28, 2013. If our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, a significant portion of the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical costs will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 9 years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements. During fiscal 2013, the Company contributed $505 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2014 to total approximately $275 million to $325 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2014 will be determined based on our January 1, 2014 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available in late fiscal 2014. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

The Company has a foreign exchange risk management program that is intended to reduce earnings fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts designed to hedge projected foreign currency denominated operating income exposures for periods that generally do not exceed four years. Based on our current hedge portfolio and other potential currency impacts in fiscal 2014, we currently project an adverse impact to growth in segment operating income in fiscal 2014 of approximately $200 million, driven by a decline in the Japanese yen since the beginning of fiscal 2013.

34
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS – 2012 vs. 2011

Media Networks

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Affiliate Fee growth of 6% was driven by increases of 5% from higher contractual rates and 1% from subscriber growth at Cable Networks.

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $263 million at Cable Networks from $3,522 million to $3,785 million, partially offset by a decrease of $162 million at Broadcasting from $4,076 million to $3,914 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 6% due to higher rates. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected decreases of 7% due to lower ABC ratings, and 2% due to lower local television advertising driven by lower political advertising, partially offset by an increase of 5% due to higher ABC advertising rates.

The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher program sales at Broadcasting driven by Castle, Once Upon a Time and Revenge, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues, primarily due to Lost, and lower Disney Channel program sales.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $231 million from $8,760 million to $8,991 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production costs of $359 million was primarily due to higher sports rights costs due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, MLB and NBA programming and expanded rights for the Wimbledon Championships. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $128 million reflecting the absence of The Oprah Winfrey Show at our local television stations and lower program write-offs at ABC.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Income from equity investees increased to $627 million in the current year from $584 million in the prior year driven by an increase at AETN primarily due to higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. This increase was partially offset by equity losses at Hulu, which were driven by higher programming and marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and subscription revenues.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 8%, or $473 million, to $6.6 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channels and higher equity income from AETN.

35
The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Parks and Resorts

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1.1 billion, to $12.9 billion due to an increase of $1.0 billion at our domestic operations and an increase of $86 million at our international operations.

Revenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 5% increase from higher average guest spending and a 5% increase from volume. Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, food and beverage spending, and daily hotel room rates. The volume increase was driven by higher passenger cruise days from the Disney Fantasy and the Disney Dream, which launched in March 2012 and January 2011, respectively, increased attendance at our domestic parks reflecting strong growth at Disneyland Resort, which benefited from the opening of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure and an increase in occupied room nights at Aulani, our hotel and vacation club resort in Hawaii, which opened in August 2011.

Revenue growth of 3% at our international operations reflected a 3% increase from higher average guest spending, a 3% increase from higher attendance and a 3% increase from higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort. These increases were partially offset by a 4% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and a decrease of 1% from lower hotel occupancy at Disneyland Paris. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average daily hotel room rates and ticket prices. Higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort reflected the impact from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011.

36
The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.

(2)Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.30 and $1.39 for fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased by $285 million from $3,540 million to $3,825 million and cost of sales, which increased $96 million from $1,198 million to $1,294 million. Higher operating labor was driven by new guest offerings, labor cost inflation and higher employee benefit costs. The increase in cost of sales was driven by higher volumes. Other operating expenses, which include maintenance, utilities, investments in information technology and property taxes, increased due to new guest offerings. Significant new guest offerings that drove increased other operating expenses and operating labor were the Disney Fantasy, the Disney Dream and the expansion of Disney California Adventure. These increases were partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the collection of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by marketing for resort expansion and new guest offerings and labor and other cost inflation.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 22%, or $349 million, to $1.9 billion driven by increases at our domestic parks and resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris.

Studio Entertainment

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

37
Revenues

Lower theatrical distribution revenues were driven by fewer releases, partially offset by the strong performance of Marvel’s The Avengers.

Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 12% decrease from a decline in unit sales reflecting lower catalog sales and the performance of the current-year titles. Significant titles in the current year included Marvel’s The Avengers and Cars 2 while the prior year included Toy Story 3 and Tangled. The decrease was partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher net effective pricing domestically, which benefited from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns.

The decrease in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was driven by lower revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the prior-year performance of Cars merchandise. Television distribution revenue was comparable to the prior year as higher syndication sales in international markets was offset by lower sales in the domestic pay television market.

Cost and Expenses

Operating expenses included a decrease of $200 million in film cost amortization, from $1,885 million to $1,685 million, driven by lower home entertainment sales volume and a lower average production cost amortization rate for television distribution sales, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold, which decreased $145 million from $1,368 million to $1,223 million driven by a decline in home entertainment sales volume and fewer theatrical titles in release.

The decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to lower marketing expenses at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses driven by fewer major releases in the current year.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 17% to $722 million primarily due to improved results at our domestic theatrical and television distribution businesses, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs in the current year.

Consumer Products

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 6% increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a decreased revenue share with Studio Entertainment due to lower revenues from Cars merchandise, higher performance of Spider-Man, Minnie and Mickey and Avengers merchandise and higher recognition of minimum guarantees.

The 7% increase in retail and other revenue reflected growth at our retail business driven by new stores in North America and Europe, increased online sales due to promotional events, and higher comparable store sales in North America. These increases were partially offset by lower comparable store sales in Europe.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included an increase of $26 million in cost of goods sold from $567 million to $593 million driven by increased sales volume at our retail business. Operating expenses also include labor, occupancy and distribution costs and increased by 1% due to higher distribution costs driven by higher third-party royalties and by 1% due to higher occupancy and labor costs. The increase in occupancy and labor costs was driven by the expansion of the English language learning centers in China and new retail stores in North America and Europe.

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by higher marketing and promotions expense.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 15% to $937 million due to increases at our licensing and retail businesses.

Interactive

Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The decrease in game sales and subscriptions revenue was driven by decreases of 29% from lower console game unit sales and 8% from lower net effective pricing of console games reflecting the strong performance of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Cars 2 and Epic Mickey in the prior-year period. These decreases were partially offset by an 11% increase from higher social games revenue reflecting improved performance from current period titles and lower acquisition accounting impacts.

Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by an increase at our mobile phone business in Japan.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses included a $21 million decrease in product development costs from $352 million to $331 million driven by decreased console game development. Operating expenses also include cost of sales, which decreased by $71 million from $323 million to $252 million driven by lower console game sales volume, partially offset by an increase at social games associated with revenue growth.

The decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to lower marketing costs at our console games business driven by fewer releases in the current period, lower acquisition accounting expenses at our social games business, and higher cost allocations to other Company businesses related to website design and maintenance and online revenues.

Segment Operating Loss

Segment operating loss decreased 30% to $216 million driven by improved results at our social games and online businesses, partially offset by a decrease at our console games business.

NON-SEGMENT ITEMS – 2012 vs. 2011

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 3%, from $459 million to $474 million due to higher labor costs and charitable contributions.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in interest expense reflected higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower effective interest rates.

Effective Income Tax Rate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points due to the impact in the prior year of the gain on the sale of Miramax, an increase in earnings from foreign operations subject to tax at rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate, partially offset by the absence of a tax rate benefit recognized in the prior year from an impairment charge. The book value of Miramax included non-deductible goodwill such that the taxable gain on the sale of Miramax resulted in tax expense that exceeded the book gain resulting in a 1.0 percentage point adverse impact on the 2011 effective tax rate. The increase in foreign earnings subject to tax at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate caused a 0.3 percentage point benefit to the 2012 effective tax rate. The impairment charge in 2011 related to assets that had a tax basis in excess of book value resulting in a tax benefit that exceeded the pre-tax impairment charge resulting in a 0.3 percentage point benefit to the 2011 tax rate.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $40 million to $491 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by lower operating results at Disneyland Paris including the impact of the DLP debt charge.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2013 increased 19% or $1.5 billion to $9.5 billion as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase reflected higher operating cash receipts from increased revenues at Parks and Resorts, Media Networks and Consumer Products, timing of collections at Studio Entertainment, and lower pension contributions and interest payments. The decrease in interest payments was due to a significant payment of accrued interest in connection with the prior year refinancing of Disneyland Paris' borrowings. These cash flow increases were partially offset by higher operating cash payments at Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and Parks and Resorts and the payment related to the Celador litigation. The increase in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by higher film production spending and the timing of participation payments, while the increase in cash payments at Media Networks was due to higher television programming and production spending. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was due to higher spending on new guest offerings and labor cost inflation, partially offset by the absence of a repurchase of vacation club mortgage receivables, which occurred in the prior year.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2012 increased 14% or $1.0 billion to $8.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher net operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Parks and Resorts, Media Networks and Consumer Products businesses and lower operating cash payments at Studio Entertainment driven by lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs. These cash flow increases were partially offset by higher operating cash payments at Parks and Resorts, lower operating cash receipts at Studio Entertainment driven by lower revenues, and higher interest and income tax payments. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation and costs for resort expansion and new guest offerings. The increase in interest payments was primarily due to the payment of previously accrued interest on Disneyland Paris borrowings.

Depreciation expense is as follows:

Amortization of intangible assets is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company’s Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company’s broadcast, cable networks and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when 

39
the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.

The Company’s film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investing Activities

Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new rides and attractions, cruise ships, recurring capital and capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The decrease in capital expenditures at Parks and Resorts in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to higher spending in the prior year, which included the final progress payment for the Disney Fantasy cruise ship, the expansion of Disney California Adventure, the construction of Disney's Art of Animation Resort and the development of MyMagic+, compared to the current year, which included higher spending related to the construction of the Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in capital expenditures at Parks and Resorts in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by resort expansion and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and construction costs at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by reduced expenditures at Disneyland Resort.

40
Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.

Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The decrease in fiscal 2013 reflected higher spending in the prior year for corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The increase in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure.

Other Investing Activities

During fiscal 2013, acquisitions totaled $2.4 billion driven by the acquisition of Lucasfilm. Proceeds from dispositions totaled $0.4 billion primarily due to the sale of our 50% equity interest in ESS.

During fiscal 2012, acquisitions totaled $1.1 billion driven by the acquisition of an incremental 43% interest in UTV and a 49% interest in Seven TV network in Russia. We also made a $300 million equity contribution to AETN.

During fiscal 2011, we received proceeds from dispositions of $0.6 billion primarily from the sale of Miramax and invested $0.2 billion in acquisitions, which included additional payments related to the fiscal 2010 acquisition of Playdom, Inc.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2012. The net use of cash in the current year was due to repurchases of common stock of $4.1 billion and dividends of $1.3 billion, partially offset by cash benefits associated with the exercise and vesting of equity awards of $0.8 billion and contributions from our Shanghai Disney Resort joint venture partner of $0.5 billion. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $1.2 billion versus the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock of $1.1 billion.

Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 was $3.0 billion compared to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2011. The net use of cash in fiscal 2012 was driven by repurchases of common stock of $3.0 billion and dividend payments of $1.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $1.0 billion and net borrowings of $0.4 billion. The decrease in cash used by financing activities of $0.2 billion compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a decrease of $2.0 billion in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $1.2 billion less net borrowings, an increase of $0.3 billion in dividend payments and $0.1 billion lower proceeds from exercises of stock options.

During the year ended September 28, 2013, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

41
The Company’s bank facilities as of September 28, 2013 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread depending on the credit default swap spread applicable to the Company's debt, subject to a cap and floor that vary with the Company's debt rating assigned by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's. The spread above LIBOR can range from 0.23% to 1.93%.

The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in February 2015, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of September 28, 2013, $252 million of letters of credit had been issued of which none were issued under this facility. 

The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.

The Company paid a $0.75 per share dividend ($1.3 billion) during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 related to fiscal 2012. The Company paid a $0.60 per share dividend ($1.1 billion) during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to fiscal 2011. The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($0.8 billion) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2013. 

During fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased 71 million shares of its common stock for approximately $4.1 billion. During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 72 million shares of its common stock for approximately $3.0 billion. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 135 million shares of its common stock for $5.0 billion. As of September 28, 2013, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 161 million additional shares. 

We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors”. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company’s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 28, 2013, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard & Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 28, 2013, by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.

42
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 28, 2013 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $117 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. Amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt, and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. In 2023, the Company has the ability to call a debt instrument prior to its scheduled maturity, which if exercised by the Company would reduce future interest payments by $1.1 billion.

(2)Other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.

(3)Contractual commitments include the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees

The Company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.

Legal and Tax Matters

As disclosed in Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

43
Film and Television Revenues and Costs

We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.

With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.

With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the program’s rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company’s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.

We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program’s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.

Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company’s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.

Revenue Recognition

The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.

We reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. 

44
Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.

We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a five-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions

The Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 5.00% at the end of fiscal 2013 from 3.85% at the end of fiscal 2012 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our September 28, 2013 measurement date. This increase in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2014. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2014 by $204 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 28, 2013 by $1.9 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $192 million and $1.6 billion, respectively.

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. We decreased our long-term expected return on plan assets to 7.50% at the end of fiscal 2013 from 7.75% at the end of the fiscal 2012. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2014 annual benefit expense by approximately $90 million.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.

To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.

In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair 

45
values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.

The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.

During fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were not material.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.

Contingencies and Litigation

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.

Income Tax Audits

As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K.
