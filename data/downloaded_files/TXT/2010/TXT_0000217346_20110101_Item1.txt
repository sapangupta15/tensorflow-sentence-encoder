Revenues for Cessnas principal lines of business were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The family of business jets currently produced by Cessna includes the Citation CJ1+, Citation CJ2+, Citation CJ3, Citation CJ4, Citation Sovereign, Citation X, Citation XLS+ and Mustang. The Cessna Caravan is the worlds best-selling utility turboprop. Caravans are offered in four models: the Grand Caravan, the Super Cargomaster, the Caravan 675 and the Caravan Amphibian. Caravans are used in the United States primarily for overnight express package shipments and for personal transportation.

Cessna offers nine models in its single-engine piston product line, which include the four-place Skyhawk, Skyhawk SP, Skylane, Turbo Skylane, Corvalis and Corvalis TT, the six-place Stationair and Turbo Stationair and the two-place Skycatcher.  

The Citation family of aircraft currently is supported by nine Citation Service Centers owned or operated by Cessna, along with authorized independent service stations and centers located in more than 27 countries throughout the world. Cessna-owned Service Centers provide customers with 24-hour service and maintenance. Cessna also provides around-the-clock parts support for Citation aircraft. Cessna Caravan and single-engine piston customers receive product support through independently owned service stations and around-the-clock parts support through Cessna.  

Cessna markets its products worldwide through its own sales force, as well as through a network of authorized independent sales representatives, depending upon the product line. Cessna has several competitors domestically and internationally in various market segments. Cessnas aircraft compete with other aircraft that vary in size, speed, range, capacity and handling characteristics on the basis of price, product quality and reliability, product support and reputation.  

Cessnas private jet business called CitationAir offers a spectrum of private aviation lift solutions, including Jet Card, Jet Access, Jet Shares, Jet Management and Corporate Solutions. The CitationAir fleet operates throughout the contiguous U.S. and in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Bahamas and Bermuda.

Bell Segment

 Bell Helicopter is one of the leading suppliers of military and commercial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and services in the world. Revenues for Bell accounted for approximately 31%, 27% and 20% of our total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenues by Bells principal lines of business were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Bell supplies advanced military helicopters and support to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the U.S. Bells primary U.S. Government programs are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters. Bell is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company (Boeing), the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Through its strategic alliance with Boeing, Bell produces and supports the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The U.S. Marine Corps H-1 helicopter program includes a utility model and an advanced attack model, the UH-1Y and the AH-1Z, respectively, which have 84% parts commonality between them.  

Through its commercial business, Bell is a leading supplier of commercially certified helicopters and support to corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue, emergency medical helicopter operators and foreign governments. Bell produces a variety of commercial aircraft types, including light single- and twin-engine helicopters and medium twin-engine helicopters, along with other related products. The helicopters currently produced by Bell for commercial applications include the 206L-4, 407, 412EP, 429 and Huey II.  

For both its military programs and its commercial products, Bell provides post-sale support and service for its installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters through a network of Bell-owned service sites, more than 120 independent service centers and six supply centers that are located worldwide. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support, including parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service and product support engineering.  

Bell competes against a number of competitors based in the U.S. and other countries for its helicopter business, and its parts and support business competes against numerous competitors around the world. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and reliability, product support, performance and reputation.  

Textron Systems Segment

 Textron Systems product lines consist of unmanned aircraft systems, land and marine systems, weapons and sensors and a variety of defense and aviation mission support products. Textron Systems is a supplier to the defense, aerospace and general aviation markets, providing approximately 19%, 18% and 13% of Textrons revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. While this segment sells most of its products to U.S. Government customers, it also increasingly sells products to customers outside the U.S. through foreign military sales sponsored by the U.S. Government and directly through commercial sales channels. Textron Systems competes on the basis of technology, contract performance, price, product quality and reliability, product support and reputation.  

Revenues by Textron Systems product lines were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Unmanned Aircraft Systems

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Fuel Systems and Functional Components  

Our fuel systems and functional components product line is operated by our Kautex division, which is headquartered in Bonn, Germany. Kautex is a leading developer and manufacturer of blow-molded plastic fuel systems for cars, light trucks, all-terrain vehicles, windshield and headlamp washer systems, and selective catalytic reduction systems used to reduce emissions from diesel engines. Kautex produces engine camshafts in North America, and serves the automobile market worldwide, with operating facilities near its major customers around the world. In addition, from facilities in Germany and Poland, Kautex develops and produces plastic bottles and containers for food, household, laboratory and industrial uses. Revenues of Kautex accounted for approximately 16%, 12% and 13% of our total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

Our automotive products have a limited number of competitors worldwide, some of which are affiliated with the original equipment manufacturers that comprise our targeted customer base. Competition typically is based on a number of factors, including price, product quality and reliability, prior experience and available manufacturing capacity.  

Golf and Turf Care  

Our golf and turf care product line includes the products manufactured by our E-Z-GO and Jacobsen divisions. E-Z-GO designs, manufactures and sells golf cars and off-road utility vehicles powered by electric and internal combustion engines and electric on-road low speed vehicles under the E-Z-GO name, as well as multipurpose utility vehicles and off-road vehicles under the E-Z-GO, Cushman and Bad Boy Buggies brand names. E-Z-GOs diversified customer base consists primarily of golf courses, resort communities and municipalities, consumers, and commercial and industrial users such as airports, college campuses and factories. Sales are made factory direct and through distributors and dealers worldwide. E-Z-GO has two major competitors for golf cars and several other competitors for off-road, on-road and multipurpose utility vehicles. Competition is based primarily on product quality and reliability, product support, reputation and price.  

Jacobsen designs and manufactures professional turf-maintenance equipment, as well as specialized turf-care vehicles. Brand names include Ransomes, Jacobsen and Cushman. Jacobsens customers include golf courses, resort communities, sporting venues and municipalities. Products are sold through a network of distributors and dealers. Jacobsen has two major competitors for professional turf-maintenance equipment and several other competitors for specialized turf-care products. Competition is based primarily on product features, product quality and reliability, price and product support.  

Powered Tools, Testing and Measurement Equipment  

We design and manufacture powered tools, testing and measurement equipment through our Greenlee division. Greenlee designs and manufactures powered equipment, electrical test and measurement instruments, hand and hydraulic powered tools, and electrical and fiber optic assemblies under the Greenlee, Klauke, Paladin Tools, Progressive and Tempo brand names. These products  

4    

principally are used in the electrical construction, maintenance, telecommunications, data communications, wiring and plumbing industries. Greenlee distributes its products through a global network of sales representatives and distributors and sells its products directly to home improvement retailers and original equipment manufacturers. Through a joint venture, Greenlee also sells hand and powered tools for the plumbing and mechanical industries in North America. The Greenlee businesses face competition from numerous manufacturers based primarily on price, product quality and reliability.  

Finance Segment  

Our Finance segment, or the Finance group, is a commercial finance business that consists of Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and its consolidated subsidiaries, along with three other finance subsidiaries owned by Textron Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced a plan to exit the non-captive portion of the commercial finance business of our Finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture. We made the decision to exit this business in order to address our long-term liquidity position in light of the disruption and instability in the capital markets. The non-captive business is based primarily in North America and includes the following product lines: distribution finance, golf mortgage, structured capital and timeshare. The exit plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales. During 2010, we reduced our owned and managed receivable portfolio by approximately $2.4 billion and expect, depending on market conditions, to substantially liquidate the remaining non-captive portfolio over the next three to five years.  

Our Finance segment continues to originate new customer relationships and finance receivables in the captive finance business, which provides financing primarily for new Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters and, to a lesser extent, for new E-Z-GO and Jacobsen golf and turf-care equipment. We also provide financing to purchasers of pre-owned Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters on a limited basis. New finance receivables are originated primarily outside the United States. Originations in the U.S. primarily finance purchases of Textron-manufactured products for purchasers who have had difficulty in accessing other sources of financing.  

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, our Finance group paid our Manufacturing group $0.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products to third parties that were financed by the Finance group. Our Cessna and Industrial segments also received proceeds in those years of $10 million, $13 million and $18 million, respectively, from the sale of equipment from their manufacturing operations to our Finance group for use under operating lease agreements.  

The commercial finance business traditionally has been extremely competitive. Our Finance segment is subject to competition from various types of financing institutions, including banks, leasing companies, commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment vendors. Competition within the commercial finance industry primarily is focused on price, term, structure and service.  

Our Finance segments largest business risks are continued access to financing through the capital markets and the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio. See Finance Portfolio Quality in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 27 for a discussion of the credit quality of this portfolio.  

Backlog  

Our backlog at the end of 2010 and 2009 is summarized below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Orders from Cessna customers, which cover a wide spectrum of industries worldwide, are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive purchase agreement and the initial customer deposit is received. We work with our customers to provide estimated delivery dates, which may be adjusted based on the customers needs or our production schedule, but do not establish definitive delivery dates until approximately six months before expected delivery. There is considerable uncertainty as to when or whether backlog will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity, customer needs and credit availability; these factors also may be impacted by the economy and public perceptions of private corporate jet usage. While backlog is an indicator of future revenues, we cannot reasonably estimate the year each order in backlog ultimately will result in revenues and cash flows.  

5    

Orders remain in backlog until the aircraft is delivered or upon cancellation by the customer. Upon cancellation, deposits are used to defray costs, including remarketing fees, cost to reconfigure the aircraft and other costs incurred as a result of the cancellation. Remaining deposits, if any, may be retained or refunded at our discretion.  

Approximately 58% of our total backlog at January 1, 2011 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2011.  

The U.S. Government is obligated only up to the amount of funding formally appropriated for a contract. The difference between the award value of the contract and the amount formally appropriated (funded) represents unfunded backlog. At January 1, 2011, substantially all U.S. Government backlog included in the above table was funded. Under a multi-year procurement contract with the U.S. Government for the purchase of V-22 tiltrotor aircraft, Bell has $4.9 billion of funded backlog included in the above table. Bell also has approximately $1.2 billion of unfunded orders under the V-22 program that have not yet been appropriated and are not included in the above table.  

U.S. Government Contracts  

In 2010, approximately 34% of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the U.S. Government. This business is subject to competition, changes in procurement policies and regulations, the continuing availability of funding, which is dependent upon congressional appropriations, national and international priorities for defense spending, world events, and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate.  

Our contracts with the U.S. Government generally may be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination, including, if applicable, reasonable profit on such work, as well as reasonable termination costs. If, however, the U.S. Government terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted, an agreed-upon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property, and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government will not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and will be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract; and (c) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.  

Research and Development  

Information regarding our research and development expenditures is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 50 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Patents and Trademarks

Patents developed while under contract with the U.S. Government may be subject to use by the U.S. Government. We also own or license active trademark registrations and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in various foreign countries or regions, as well as trade names and service marks. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole. Some of these trademarks, trade names and service marks are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports, including: AAI; AH-1Z; BA609; Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company, LLC; Bell Helicopter; Bravo; Cadillac Gage; Caravan; Caravan Amphibian; Caravan 675; Cessna; Cessna 350; Cessna 400; Citation; CitationAir; CitationAir Jetcard; Citation Encore+; Citation Sovereign; Citation X; Citation XLS+; CJ1+; CJ2+; CJ3; CJ4; CLAW; Corvalis; Eclipse; Excel; E-Z-GO; Fly Bell; Fly Smart; Grand Caravan; Greenlee; H-1; Huey II; IE2; Kautex; Kiowa Warrior; Klauke; Lycoming; M1117 ASV; McCauley; Mustang; Next Generation Fuel System; NGFS; Overwatch; Paladin; PDCue; Power Advantage; Progressive; ProParts; Rothenberger LLC; RXV; Sensor Fuzed Weapon; Shadow; SkyBOOKS; Skycatcher; Skyhawk; Skyhawk SP; Skylane; SkyPLUS; Sovereign; Stationair; ST 4X4; Super Cargomaster; SuperCobra; SYMTX; TDCue; Tempo; Textron; Textron Defense Systems; Textron Financial Corporation; Textron Global Technology Center; Textron Marine & Land Systems; Textron Systems; Turbo Skylane; Turbo Stationair; UAV SYSTEMS SPECIALIST; UH-1Y; US Helicopter; V-22 Osprey; 2FIVE; and 429. These marks and their related trademark designs and logotypes (and variations of the foregoing) are trademarks, trade names or service marks of Textron Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures.  

Environmental Considerations  

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and expenditures for environmental control facilities has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional information regarding environmental matters is contained in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets nor on our results of operations, capital  

6    

 expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.  

Employees  

At January 1, 2011, we had approximately 32,000 employees.
