BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW:  

Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2,600 company owned stores. Most of our customers are in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and maintenance and repair operations (MRO). The non-residential construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. Other users of our product include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our stores and customers are primarily located in North America.  

Like most industrial and construction centric organizations, we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years. The third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices (approximately 50% of our sales consist of some type of fastener  nuts, bolts, screws, etc.  most of which are made of steel) and energy prices (a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across North America).  

In the fourth quarter of 2008, and throughout much of 2009, this inflation turned to deflation. When the swings are dramatic, this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices. This hurt our gross margins in 2009. The drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief, but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation. The deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to recover in 2010 and 2011. (See later discussion on gross margins.)  

The discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2011. This information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year. However, we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes, sequential trends, and end market information that follow  they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty.  

Over the last several years, we have continued to make significant investments in (1) store locations, (2) national accounts, (3) government sales, (4) internal manufacturing support, (5) international operations (now over 10% of our sales), (6) FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending), (7) product expansion (with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive brands), and (8) additional sales specialists to support safety products, metalworking products, and our manufacturing operations. We are excited about the prospects of each.  

As always, the pathway to profit is the cornerstone of our business evolution, and it influences everything we do. Remember, our business centers on our 2,600 stores  their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time. As always, we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of Growth through Customer Service.  

SALES GROWTH:  

Net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in net sales in 2011 came primarily from higher unit sales. Our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products, but the impact was limited. Our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services, but was helped by initiatives such as FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending). The higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document) and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years. The growth in net sales at the older store locations was helped by the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment, an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008. The change in currencies in foreign countries (primarily Canada) relative to the United States dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 0.7% in 2011.

The increase in net sales in 2010 came primarily from higher unit sales. Our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services. The higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document) and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years. The growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment, an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008. The increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the Canadian currency relative to the United States dollar and from our Holo-Krome business, which we acquired in December 2009. These two items added approximately 0.7 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, to our growth in 2010.  

The decrease in net sales in 2009 came primarily from lower unit sales, the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes, particularly in our steel based products. Our sales change in 2009 was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services. The lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document); this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years. The decrease in sales at older store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in 2008 and the first part of 2009.  

The impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group  opened 2001 and earlier, 2010 group  opened 2000 and earlier, and 2009 group  opened 1999 and earlier) and opened greater than five years ago (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group  opened 2006 and earlier, 2010 group  opened 2005 and earlier, and 2009 group  opened 2004 and earlier). These two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. The stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent same store view of our business (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group  opened 2009 and earlier, 2010 group  opened 2008 and earlier, and 2009 group  opened 2007 and earlier). The daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: The age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year.  

Stores opened in 2011 contributed approximately $27,120 (or 1.0%) to 2011 net sales. Stores opened in 2010 contributed approximately $78,458 (or 2.8%) to 2011 net sales and approximately $22,040 (or 1.0%) to 2010 net sales. The rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years, and, as stated earlier, the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores.  

SALES BY PRODUCT LINE:  

The approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows:

COMMENTS REGARDING MONTHLY SALES CHANGES, SEQUENTIAL TRENDS, AND END MARKET PERFORMANCE  

Note  Daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period.  

This section focuses on three distinct views of our business  monthly sales changes, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a period to the immediately preceding period) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.  

MONTHLY SALES CHANGES:  

All company sales  During each of the twelve months in 2011, 2010, and 2009, all of our selling locations, when combined, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The growth in 2010 and 2011 generally continues the improving trend we saw in the latter half of 2009. The negative growth in 2009 relates to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. The change in currencies in foreign countries (primarily Canada) relative to the United States dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 0.7% during 2011.  

Stores opened greater than two years  Our stores opened greater than two years (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group  opened 2009 and earlier, 2010 group  opened 2008 and earlier, and 2009 group  opened 2007 and earlier) represent a consistent same-store view of our business. During each of the twelve months in 2011, 2010, and 2009, the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Stores opened greater than five years  The impact of the economy, over time, is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group  opened 2006 and earlier, 2010 group  opened 2005 and earlier, and 2009 group  opened 2004 and earlier). This group is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. During each of the twelve months in 2011, 2010, and 2009, the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

SEQUENTIAL TRENDS:  

We find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway  This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.  

24  

Table of Contents 

History has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months with impaired business days (certain holidays). The first landing centers on Easter, which alternates between March and April (Easter occurred in April in both 2011 and 2010), the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the Christmas / New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.  

The table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled Past is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003. We chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics, a weaker industrial economy in North America, and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line. The 2010 and 2011 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The 10Delta line is the difference between the Past and 2010; similarly, the 11Delta is the difference between the Past and 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.  

During 2010 and 2011, sales were strongour business has closely followed the trend line since the fall of 2009. The months of February 2011 and 2010 were both negatively impacted by weather.  

A graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above, starting with a base of 100 in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows:

END MARKET PERFORMANCE:  

Fluctuations in end market business  The sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. To place this in perspective  approximately 50% of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing. The daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (when compared to the same quarter in the previous year), and for the year, as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2011 and 2010 growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business (this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers) and less pronounced in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business (this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing). The 2009 contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business. These patterns are influenced by the movements noted in the Purchasing Manufacturers Index (PMI) published by the Institute for Supply Management (http://www.ism.ws/), which is a composite index of economic activity in the manufacturing sector. The PMI in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our non-residential construction customers have historically represented 20% to 25% of our business. The daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (when compared to the same quarter in the previous year), and for the year, as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On a sequential basis, the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in May 2009 and then started to demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms. This reversed the negative trend which began in October 2008. This stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our non-residential construction business which weakened dramatically in the first eight months of 2009, and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms.

PATHWAY TO PROFIT AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS:  

In April 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business  For most of the preceding ten years, we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business (our historical rate was approximately 14% new stores each year). As announced in April 2007, we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns. We funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7% to 10% per year (see our disclosure below regarding store growth in recent periods). Our goal was four-fold: (1) to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model, (2) to grow the sales of our average store to $125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012, (3) to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow, resulting in a growth of our pre-tax earnings to 23% of net sales by 2012, and (4) to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital (primarily inventory) as our average sales volume per store increases. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the pathway to profit in 2009. These changes centered on two aspects (1) temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of 2% to 5% per year, and (2) temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing. However, as our business trends started to improve late in 2009, we began to increase our planned openings and headcount growth. (See later discussion on future store openings and on store count and full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount.)  

The pathway to profit initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business: (1) sales force headcount, (2) store (or unit) growth, and (3) average sales volume per store, which ultimately drive our level of profitability. Our original goal was to hit the $125 thousand per month store average, and grow our pre-tax earnings to 23% of net sales, by 2012. We previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by 24-30 months. However, in 2010 we modified our thought process around the  

27  

Table of Contents 

 pathway to profit in two regards. First, the pathway to profit initiative is slowly lowering our cost structure. With a structurally lowered cost structure and improved gross margins, we concluded we could hit our profitability target in the pathway to profit initiative with average store sales of $100$110 thousand per month in 2013 (see evidence of this in our Store Size and Profitability table later in this document). Second, we decided to hire fewer store-based employees and instead added resources focused on specific sales opportunities, such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists (manufacturing, government, industry focused, and industrial vending). The decision to accelerate the addition of non-store selling resources into the areas of national accounts and dedicated sales specialists reinforces our belief that these areas represent an efficient manner to accelerate sales at existing stores.  

Future store openings and increases in FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending)In July 2010, we indicated our intentions to open 80 to 95 new stores during the second half of 2010 (or an annualized rate of 6.8% to 8.0%). During the second half of 2010 we opened 82 stores. For 2011, we originally disclosed our intention to open 150 to 200 new stores, or an annualized rate of 6.0% to 8.0%. As the PMI began to moderate in May 2011 (see table earlier in this document), our field personnel began to slow their store openings. As a result, we opened 122 new stores in 2011, or approximately 4.9%. In 2012, we expect to open approximately 4.0% to 6.0% new stores. We believe this is a rational reaction to the current PMI and due to the good results we are experiencing with our national accounts and dedicated sales specialists, particularly related to our FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) rollout (discussed below). During 2011 and 2010, we closed 28 and seven stores, respectively. These closures resulted from our belief we could better serve those local markets with a different store footprint. We have closed 64 stores in our 40+ year history.  

As was discussed at our investor day in May 2011, we have made significant progress in the development of FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) for our customers. We believe these solutions have the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution. Some key statistics regarding this business include the following:

 2   This represents the number of machines installed and producing revenue on the last day of the quarter.  

 3   The percentage of total sales (vended and traditional) to customers currently using a vending solution.  

 4  The growth in total sales (vended and traditional) to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the comparable period in the preceding year.  

In addition to the increases in the number of vending machine contracts signed and the sales results noted, we are pleased with the ramp-up in our ability to install machines. In the third and fourth quarter of 2011, we installed 1,775 machines (5,642 versus 3,867) and 1,811 machines (7,453 versus 5,642), respectively, a dramatic increase over the 331 (1,515 versus 1,184) and 410 machines (1,925 versus 1,515) installed in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, respectively.

Store Count and Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) HeadcountThe two tables that follow highlight certain impacts of the pathway to profit. Under the pathway to profit we increased both our store count and our store FTE headcount during 2007 and 2008. However, as indicated earlier, the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our FTE headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008. In the two tables that follow, we refer to our store sales, store locations, store personnel and store profitability. When we discuss stores in the first table, we are referring to (1) Fastenal stores and (2) strategic account stores. Fastenal stores are either a traditional store, the typical format in North America, or an overseas store, which is the typical format outside the United States and Canada. This is discussed in greater detail earlier in this report. Strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market. When we discuss in the second table our profitability as the average monthly store sales grow, we are referring to traditional stores. The sales, outside of our store group, relate to either (1) our in-plant locations, (2) the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store (including our Holo-Krome business acquired in December 2009), or (3) our direct import business.  

The breakdown of our sales, the average monthly sales per store, the number of stores at quarter end, the average headcount at our stores during a quarter, the average FTE headcount during a quarter, and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 (the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit), for the third quarter of 2008 (our peak quarter before the economy weakened), and for each of the last five quarters:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note  Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.  

Our original intent under the pathway to profit was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately $125,000 per month (see earlier discussion) in order to meet our pre-tax earnings profitability goal of 23%. This would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories ($0 to $30,000, $30,001 to $60,000, and $60,001 to $100,000) to the last three categories ($60,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $150,000, and over $150,000), and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity. Our goal today is to continue (1) to grow the business and (2) to grow our pre-tax earnings as a percent of net sales. As stated earlier, we now believe, based on the profitability improvements noted in the table above, we can hit our pre-tax earnings percent goal of 23% with average store sales of approximately $100,000$110,000 per month.

Note  Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.  

Gross profit  relative to sales, was consistent in 2011 and 2010 and improved from 2009.  

The gross profit percentage in the first, second, third and fourth quarters was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in: (1) transactional gross profit, (2) organizational gross profit, and (3) vendor incentive gross profit. The transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the day-to-day fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs. The organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains. The third component relates to vendor volume allowances.  

In the short-term, periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories, while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third. This impact can be magnified, as in 2009, due to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year.  

In the past, we have indicated that we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is 51% to 53%. This is based on our current mix of products, geographies, end markets, and end market uses (such as industrial production business versus maintenance business). We exceeded this range late in 2008, primarily due to inflationary trends in our business. The impact was evenly split between the transactional and organizational gross profit categories. This benefit carried into the first quarter of 2009, and quickly dissipated. In the second quarter of 2009, the trend flipped to deflation and our gross margin began to drop. About 80% of this drop was evenly split between the same two categories and the other 20% related to the dramatic drop in business volumes and the related drop in vendor incentive gross profit. In the second half of 2009, these two factors (deflation and a drop in business volume), plus the competitive environment of a severe recession, pushed our gross margin to the bottom, and then just below, our expected range. This drop was equally felt in the three categories noted above.  

Our business began to expand during 2010 and the drag on gross margins related to deflation began to subside. This allowed our gross margins to move back into the expected range. In the second quarter of 2010, we moved into the middle of our expected gross profit range as the three components of gross profit improved, the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components. We remained in the middle of the expected range until the fourth quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our gross margin felt pressure and dropped to the lower end of our range. This drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional margin (primarily due to changes in product and customer mix), lower vendor incentive gross profit, and lower freight utilization. The latter two items created half of the gross margin drop and are more of a seasonal issue.

Operating and administrative expensesimproved relative to sales in 2011 versus both 2010 and 2009.  

Historically, 65% to 70% of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs. The components are: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes. During 2009, these components had reduced to a range between 60% and 65% due to the factors noted below. During 2011 and 2010, this range moved back to the historical level.  

The two largest components of employee related costs grew/contracted as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The two largest components of operating and administrative expenses, outside of the employee related costs, grew/contracted as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in payroll costs during 2011 and 2010 noted above was greater than the change in full-time equivalent headcount noted earlier in this document. This was driven by the following factors: (1) sales commissions grew (this increase is amplified by sales growth and, in the case of 2010 versus 2009, gross margin expansion, both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned), (2) total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth, (3) hours worked per employee grew, and (4) our profit sharing contribution grew. The payroll growth in 2011 versus 2010 was amplified because there were four quarters of strong growth. In 2010, the first quarter was still at a relatively lower level of pre-tax profit. This expanded for the last three quarters of 2010.  

Our health care costs in 2011 increased from 2010. Our health care costs in the third quarter of 2010 decreased from the unusual peak in the same period of 2009. Health care costs in 2009, and the first quarter of 2010, increased dramatically due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers, increases in COBRA costs due to changes in federal funding within COBRA, and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years. The 2011 health care costs represented a more normal level of per employee expenses, relative to 2010 and 2009. This resulted in a lower level of growth relative to the industry.  

The two largest components of the remaining costs within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation. Occupancy expenses increased from 2010 to 2011 and increased from 2009 to 2010. The increase from 2010 was driven by (1) a meaningful increase in utilities, (2) a dramatic increase in the amount of FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) equipment as discussed earlier in this release (we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy), (3) an increase in the number of locations, and (4) increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years. The selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales. Selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses for 2011 increased significantly from 2010, a sharp contrast to the prior years trend. Most of the components of selling transportation costs increased at a rate less than sales growth, with two exceptions, the fuel component and the vehicle depreciation/lease payments components increased more than sales growth in 2011. This was driven primarily by the increase in per gallon fuel costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our non-store sales personnel, particularly industrial vending vehicles.

The last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasolineDuring the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011, our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately $8.6, $10.5, $9.8, and $9.8 million, respectively. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2010, our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately $6.4, $6.8, $6.6, and $7.1 million, respectively. The changes resulted from variations in fuel costs, variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers, changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations, and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles. These fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles (semi-tractors, straight trucks, and sprinter trucks) which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses (the split in the last several years has been approximately 50:50 between distribution and store and other sales centered use).  

The average per gallon fuel costs (in actual dollars) and the percentage change (on a year-over-year basis) for the last three years was as follows:

Income taxesIncomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, were approximately 37.8%, 38.4%, and 38.0% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. This rate fluctuates over time based on (1) the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, (2) the level of profits in those jurisdictions, and (3) changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions.

Net Earnings  Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2011, the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate. During 2010, the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth. During 2009, the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion. The EPS percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2008 and 2009.  

Operational Working Capital  Operational working capital, which we define as accounts receivable and inventories, are highlighted below. The annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The growth in accounts receivable noted above is driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period. The strong growth in recent years with our international business and with large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales.  

Our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable. This is impacted by other aspects of our business. For example, the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike. This occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns. Over the last decade, we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following: (1) new store openings, (2) expanded stocking breadth at individual stores, (3) expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers (for example, our master stocking hub in Indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2006 to 2011), (4) expanded direct sourcing, (5) expanded exclusive brands, and, more recently, (6) expanded FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending). We believe these were excellent investments for our business. These investments have, and we believe will continue to, leverage our sales growth.  

The discussion above covers inventory from a longer perspective; in more recent quarters, our expanding inventories are also related to (1) our expanding sales growth trends (with emphasis on our large account business  both OEM and MRO), (2) our confidence in their sustainability, (3) international expansion, and in recent months, (4) some inflation. However, this expansion has been at a rate less than sales growth which has allowed us to improve our inventory utilization.

As we indicated in earlier communications, our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory (Annual Sales: AR&I) back to a better than a 3.0:1 ratio. On December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a ratio of 2.8:1 and 2.7:1, respectively.  

Acquisition  On December 18, 2009, we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products (a type of fastener). The business had an established name, Holo-Krome, and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees. The business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results (there were some balance sheet impacts of the all cash acquisition, as noted in our cash flow statement). The acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in 2011 and 2010.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Net cash provided by operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2011 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in earnings. The 2010 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales. The 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was unusually high primarily due to the weak economy and the decrease in working capital needed in the business.  

The approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on December 31: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

New stores open with the standard store model, which consists of a core stocking level of approximately $50 thousand per location. This inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows.  

Net cash used in investing activities  Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:

Net property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The net cash used in investing activities and net expenditures for property and equipment both increased from 2010 to 2011. The increase was caused by the dramatic increase in the number of FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) equipment deployed in our business. The net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from 2009 to 2010. However, the net expenditures for property and equipment (purchases less proceeds of disposals) increased from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to expansions at our Indianapolis, Indiana distribution center and increased spending for our FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending).  

Property and equipment expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 consist of: (1) purchase of software and hardware for Fastenals information processing systems, (2) addition of certain pickup trucks, (3) purchase of signage, shelving, and other fixed assets related to store openings, (4) addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment, (5) expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties, (6) expansion of Fastenals distribution/trucking fleet, (7) cost related to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center (2010 and 2009), (8) cost of a new manufacturing facility for our Holo-Krome business in Wallingford, Connecticut (2010), (9) purchases related to our FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending), which primarily consists of automated vending equipment, and (10) cost related to the expansion of our Winona, Minnesota distribution center (2011). Disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick-up trucks, semi-tractors, and trailers in the normal course of business, and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations.  

An estimate of our 2012 net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2011 and 2010 net capital expenditures is provided below. As of year end, we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures.  

We anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations, from available cash and cash equivalents, and, if necessary, from our borrowing capacity. In addition to opening new stores in the United States, we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets.

We have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end. The facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future lease payments. The expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows:

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years and, in the case of 2011, a reduction due to stock option exercises. These items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Stock Repurchase In July 2009, our board of directors authorized purchases by us of up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. This authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors. During 2009, we purchased 2,200,000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately $18.69 per share. These purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. We did not purchase any stock in 2011 or 2010. As of February 9, 2012, we have remaining authority to purchase up to 1,800,000 additional shares of our common stock.  

Dividends  We declared a dividend of $0.17 per share on January 17, 2012. We paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $0.65, $0.62, and $0.36 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  

Line of Credit  We have an $8,000 line of credit under which $0 was outstanding at year end. The line bears interest at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.  

Effects of Inflation We noted minimal price changes in 2011 and 2010. Price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009.  

Critical Accounting Policies Our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts  This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. The analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable, the financial condition of a customer or industry, and general economic conditions. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers.  

Inventory reserve  This reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage. The reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends. The analysis includes inventory levels, sales information, physical inventory counts, cycle count adjustments, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

Health insurance reserve  This reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

General insurance reserve  This reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation, property and casualty losses, and other self-insured losses. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

Tax strategies  Our effective income tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We establish income tax reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit, when (i) there is a completion of a tax audit, (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods.  

Legal reserves  Occasionally we are involved in legal matters. The outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures. We record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation, the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded.

New Accounting Pronouncements  

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820). This accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. It also requires presentation on the face of the financial statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. This accounting standard update is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2012.  

In August 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This update approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  

Proposed Accounting Pronouncements  

In recent exposure drafts, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the FASB proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases. From a lessees perspective, the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and finance/capital leases. In its place, a right-of-use model would be used. This proposal, as currently written, would require the lessee to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments. This would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized. This exposure draft is not yet finalized; however, we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and many of our vehicles are currently leased, and those leases are accounted for as operating leases.  

Geographic Information  Information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading Certain Risks and Uncertainties and Item 1A. Risk Factors.
