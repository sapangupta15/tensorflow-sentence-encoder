ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

 Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates. We are currently not exposed to any significant market risks or interest rate risk from the use of derivatives.  

 Credit Risk. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss, the recent volatility in the financial markets is likely to significantly impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally with collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our customersÂ’ ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the current financial crisis and volatility of the markets. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable is limited because of the diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and obtain collateral or other security from our customers when appropriate.  

 Interest Rate. Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our convertible subordinated notes. The fair market value of our fixed rate convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk because of their fixed interest rate and market risk due to the convertible feature of our convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price falls. The interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes but do not impact their carrying value. The fair market values of our convertible subordinated notes are determined based upon quoted secondary market prices on or before the dates specified were as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 As a result of certain repurchases, redemptions and conversions, which are described in further detail in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements, none of the 4.5% Notes remained outstanding as of October 8, 2008. In addition, the volatility of the credit markets is likely to significantly impact our interest income related to our cash investments.  

 Currency Risk. The business of our Canadian subsidiaries is subject to currency fluctuations. We do not expect any such currency risk to be material.
