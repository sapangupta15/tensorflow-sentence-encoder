Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk  

 Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longâ€‘term debt obligations. We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk

on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.  

 We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.  

 Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, primarily LIBOR, which was at historically low levels during 2016. Based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at December 31, 2016, a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $4.5 million, and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $684.4 million.
