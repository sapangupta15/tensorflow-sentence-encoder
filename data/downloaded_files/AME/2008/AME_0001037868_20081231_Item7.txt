 Business Overview  

 As a global business, AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. For most of 2008, the Company continued to experience strong market conditions in many of its businesses. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company experienced lower order rates as a result of the current financial and economic crisis. For the full year 2008, contributions from recent acquisitions and internal growth, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, enabled the Company to post another year of record sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. In addition to achieving its financial objectives, the Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2008 were:  

       In 2008, sales were $2.5 billion, an increase of $394.2 million or 18% from 2007, on internal growth of approximately 5% in the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 2% in the Electromechanical Group (EMG) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, and contributions from the 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. During 2008, the Company completed the following acquisitions:    

       In February 2008, the Company acquired Drake Air (Drake). Drake is a provider of heat-transfer repair services to the commercial aerospace industry.   

       In February 2008, the Company acquired Motion Control Group (MCG). MCG is a leading global manufacturer of highly customized motors and motion control solutions for the medical, life sciences, industrial automation, semiconductor and aviation markets.   

       In April 2008, the Company acquired Reading Alloys. Reading Alloys is a global leader in specialty titanium master alloys and highly engineered metal powders used in the aerospace, medical implant, military and electronics markets.   

       In June 2008, the Company acquired Vision Research, Inc. Vision Research is a leading manufacturer of high-speed digital imaging systems used for motion capture and analysis in numerous test and measurement applications.   

       In August 2008, the Company acquired the programmable power business of Xantrex Technology, Inc. (Xantrex Programmable). Xantrex Programmable is a leader in alternating current and direct current programmable power supplies used to test electrical and electronic products.   

       In November 2008, the Company acquired UK-based Muirhead Aerospace Limited (Muirhead). Muirhead is a leading manufacturer of motion technology products and a provider of avionics repair and overhaul services for the aerospace and defense markets.   

       As the Company grows globally, it continues to achieve an increasing level of international sales. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were $1,225.5 million of consolidated sales in 2008, compared with $1,053.7 million of consolidated sales in 2007.    

 22   
       The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $115.9 million in 2008 before customer reimbursement of $6.1 million, an increase of 12.6% over 2007. Sales from products introduced in the last three years increased $71.5 million or 18.3% in 2008 to $462.8 million.   

       In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million, consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due December 2018. The proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the Companys revolving credit facility.   

       In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million 7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using proceeds from borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.   

       In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million) as a result of the global economic recession and financial crisis.   

       In 2008, the Company made $79.9 million in contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. $74.0 million in contributions were made in the fourth quarter of 2008, which had the effect of eliminating or significantly reducing the amount of unfunded pension obligations associated with the Companys pension plans.

 Results of Operations  

 In 2008, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved these results from contributions from acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007, as well as internal growth in both EIG and EMG. Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives. The Company expects the current financial and economic crisis, to have a negative impact on operating results in 2009. The full year impact of the 2008 acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities will have a positive impact on our 2009 results.  

 Net sales for 2008 were $2,531.1 million, an increase of $394.2 million or 18.4% when compared with net sales of $2,136.9 million in 2007. Net sales for EIG were $1,402.7 million in 2008, an increase of 16.9% from sales of $1,199.8 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were $1,128.5 million in 2008, an increase of 20.4% from sales of $937.1 million in 2007. The Companys internal sales growth was approximately 4% in 2008, which excludes a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

 Total international sales for 2008 were $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated net sales, an increase of $171.8 million or 16.3% when compared with international sales of $1,053.7 million or 49.3% of consolidated net sales in 2007. The increase in international sales resulted from increased international sales from base businesses of $29.3 million or 17.0% of the increase, which includes the effect of foreign currency translation, as well as the acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007, most notably Cameca SAS (Cameca), the Repair & Overhaul Division of Umeco plc (Umeco R&O), Reading Alloys, California Instruments Corporation (California Instruments) and Vision Research. Increased international sales came primarily from sales to Europe and Asia by both reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $478.5 million in 2008, an increase of $84.1 million or 21.3% compared with $394.4 million in 2007. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2008 were a record at $2,561.5 million, an increase of $273.2 million or 11.9% when compared with $2,288.3 million in 2007. The increase in new orders was primarily due to the recent acquisitions noted above. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2008 was $718.6 million, an increase of $30.4 million or 4.4% when compared with $688.2 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in backlog was primarily due to the acquired backlog of the recent acquisitions noted above. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the filing date of this Form 10-K, the Company has experienced lower order rates as a result of the current financial and economic crisis.  

 The year ended December 31, 2008 results include fourth quarter pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives to be broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance costs for slightly more than 10% of the Companys workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009. Substantially all of the payments for employee severance and lease termination costs are expected to be made in 2009.  

 Segment operating income for 2008 was $481.9 million, an increase of $54.4 million or 12.7% when compared with segment operating income of $427.5 million in 2007. Segment operating income, as a percentage of sales,  

 24   
 decreased to 19.0% for 2008 from 20.0% in 2007. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from strength in the Companys differentiated businesses and profit contributions made by the acquisitions, partially offset by the fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges and asset write-downs described above. The decrease in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted segment operating margins by 160 basis points.  

 SG&A expenses for 2008 were $322.6 million, an increase of $59.1 million or 22.4% when compared with $263.5 million in 2007. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 12.7% for 2008, compared with 12.3% in 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses was the result of higher sales, as well as a $7.1 million charge  representing a 0.3% increase in SG&A expenses  recorded in corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2005 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million of SG&A expense related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs described above. Additionally, the Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased approximately 7.9%. Excluding the impact of the fourth quarter restructuring charges and asset write-downs on selling expense of $6.9 million, a 3.2% impact, and foreign currency translation, the increase in 2008 base business selling expenses was in line with internal sales growth. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 10.8% for 2008, compared with 10.4% in 2007.  

 Corporate administrative expenses for 2008 were $49.2 million, an increase of $8.4 million or 20.6% when compared with $40.8 million in 2007. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9%, in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily the result of equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second quarter of 2008, noted above, as well as other expenses necessary to grow the Company, partially offset by equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the first and third quarters of 2007.  

 Consolidated operating income was $432.7 million or 17.1% of sales for 2008, an increase of $46.1 million or 11.9% when compared with $386.6 million or 18.1% of sales in 2007.  

 Interest expense was $63.7 million for 2008, an increase of $16.8 million or 35.8% when compared with $46.9 million in 2007. The increase was due to the impact of the funding of the private placement senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third and fourth quarters of 2008, higher average borrowings to fund the recent acquisitions and the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of the Companys common stock in 2008.  

 The effective tax rate for 2008 was 32.6% compared with 32.2% in 2007. The higher effective tax rate for 2008 primarily reflects an increase in state and foreign income taxes and the impact of accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock amortization, offset by the impact of settlements of various income tax issues with U.S. taxing authorities and a favorable agreement in the United Kingdom related to deductible interest expense for which previously unrecognized tax benefits were recognized. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 primarily reflects an enacted decrease in certain foreign corporate tax rates in the second half of 2007, partially offset by the elimination of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) tax benefit. See Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.  

 Net income for 2008 was $247.0 million, an increase of $19.0 million or 8.3% when compared with $228.0 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 was $2.30, an increase of $0.18 or 8.5% when compared with $2.12 per diluted share in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.  

 Segment Results  

 EIGs sales totaled $1,402.7 million for 2008, an increase of $202.9 million or 16.9% when compared with $1,199.8 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 5%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIGs aerospace, power, and process and analytical instrument businesses. The acquisitions of Advanced Industries, Inc. (Advanced), B&S Aircraft Parts and Accessories (B&S), Cameca, California Instruments, Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex Programmable accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 25   
 EIGs operating income was $306.8 million for 2008, an increase of $46.5 million or 17.9% when compared with $260.3 million in 2007. The increases in segment operating income were due to the contribution from the higher sales by EIGs aerospace, power and process and analytical businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million. EIGs operating margins were 21.9% of sales for 2008 compared with 21.7% of sales in 2007. The increase in operating margins was driven by operational excellence initiatives throughout the group. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs had a negative impact on EIGs operating margins of 140 basis points.  

 EMGs sales totaled $1,128.5 million for 2008, an increase of $191.4 million or 20.4% from $937.1 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 2%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EMGs differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of Seacon Phoenix, subsequently renamed AMETEK SCP, Inc. (SCP), Hamilton Precision Metals (Hamilton), Umeco R&O, Drake Air, MCG, Reading Alloys and Muirhead accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EMGs operating income was $175.2 million for 2008, an increase of $8.0 million or 4.8% when compared with $167.2 million in 2007. EMGs increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales from the groups differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions mentioned above, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $19.4 million. EMGs operating margins were 15.5% of sales for 2008 compared with 17.8% of sales in 2007. The decrease in operating margins was primarily driven by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which had a negative impact on operating margins of 170 basis points. The remainder of the decrease was the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $623.7 million, an increase of $40.4 million or 6.9% when compared with net sales of $583.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales for EIG were $361.6 million in 2008, an increase of 7.6% from sales of $336.1 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were $262.1 million in 2008, an increase of 6.1% from sales of $247.1 million in 2007. The Companys internal sales growth was approximately negative 2%, which excludes a 4% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above made up the net sales increase.  

 The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives to be broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance costs for slightly more than 10% of the Companys workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009. Substantially all of the payments for employee severance and lease termination costs are expected to be made in 2009.  

 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $43.8 million, a decrease of $18.1 million or 29.2% when compared with $61.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $0.41, a decrease of $0.16 or 28.1% when compared with $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.

 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006  

 Results of Operations  

 In 2007, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives.  

 Net sales for 2007 were $2,136.9 million, an increase of $317.6 million or 17.5% when compared with net sales of $1,819.3 million in 2006. Net sales for EIG were $1,199.8 million in 2007, an increase of 18.0% from sales of $1,016.5 million in 2006. Net sales for EMG were $937.1 million in 2007, an increase of 16.7% from sales of $802.8 million in 2006. The Companys internal sales growth was approximately 7% in 2007, which excludes a 2% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

 Total international sales for 2007 were $1,053.7 million or 49.3% of consolidated net sales, an increase of $187.7 million or 21.7% when compared with international sales of $866.0 million or 47.6% of consolidated net sales in 2006. The increase in international sales primarily resulted from increased international sales from base businesses of $74.9 million or 39.9% of the increase, which includes the effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions of Cameca, SCP, Hamilton and Umeco R&O in 2007 and Land Instruments International Limited (Land Instruments), PennEngineering Motion Technologies, Inc. (Pittman), Precitech and Southern Aeroparts, Inc. (SAI) in 2006 contributed the remainder of the increase. Increased international sales came primarily from sales to Europe by both reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $394.4 million in 2007, an increase of $50.6 million or 14.7% compared with $343.8 million in 2006. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from the base businesses and acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2007 were $2,288.3 million, an increase of $372.9 million or 19.5% when compared with $1,915.4 million in 2006. The increase in new orders was driven by the Companys base differentiated businesses, which contributed $167.2 million or 44.8% of the increase, led by the Companys aerospace and engineered materials, interconnects and packaging businesses. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2007 was $688.2 million, an increase of $151.4 million or 28.2% when compared with $536.8 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated businesses and the 2007 acquisitions noted above.  

 Segment operating income for 2007 was $427.5 million, an increase of $84.1 million or 24.5% when compared with segment operating income of $343.4 million in 2006. Segment operating income, as a percentage of sales, increased to 20.0% for 2007 from 18.9% in 2006. The increase in segment operating income resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses of each group, which includes the profit contributions made by the acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the Companys differentiated businesses.  

 SG&A expenses for 2007 were $263.5 million, an increase of $44.0 million or 20.1% when compared with $219.5 million in 2006. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were higher in 2007 at 12.3% compared to 12.1% in 2006. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 10.4% in 2007, slightly higher than the 10.2% in 2006. The selling expense increase and the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions. The Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased 9.7% for 2007, compared to 2006, which was in line with internal sales growth including the impact of foreign currency translation.  

 Corporate administrative expenses for 2007 were $40.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 19.4% when compared with $34.2 million in 2006. The increase in corporate expenses was the result of higher compensation, including equity-based compensation associated with accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants in 2007 and other costs necessary to grow the Company. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9% in both 2007 and 2006.  

 27   
 Consolidated operating income was $386.6 million or 18.1% of sales for 2007, an increase of $77.6 million or 25.1% when compared with $309.0 million or 17.0% of sales in 2006.  

 Interest expense was $46.9 million for 2007, an increase of $4.7 million or 11.1% when compared with $42.2 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher average borrowings to fund the 2007 acquisitions, higher average interest rates and the impact of the fourth quarter of 2007 funding of the private placement senior notes.  

 The effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.2% compared with 31.0% in 2006. The 2007 effective tax rate primarily reflects the elimination of the FSC/ETI tax benefit in 2007, an increase in state income taxes and an increase in interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an enacted decrease in certain foreign corporate tax rates in the second half of 2007 and the recognition of tax benefits from our international tax planning initiatives. The 2006 effective tax rate benefited primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat by higher nondeductible equity-based compensation.  

 Net income for 2007 was $228.0 million, an increase of $46.1 million or 25.3% when compared with $181.9 million in 2006. Diluted earnings per share for 2007 was $2.12, an increase of $0.41 or 24.0% when compared with $1.71 per diluted share in 2006.  

 Segment Results  

 EIGs sales totaled $1,199.8 million for 2007, an increase of $183.3 million or 18.0% when compared with $1,016.5 million in 2006. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 9%, excluding a favorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation. The internal growth was driven by sales increases in EIGs process and analytical, aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of Cameca, Land Instruments, Precitech, Advanced and B&S accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EIGs operating income was $260.3 million for 2007, an increase of $56.9 million or 28.0% when compared with $203.4 million in 2006. EIGs operating margins were 21.7% of sales for 2007 compared with 20.0% of sales in 2006. The increase in operating income and margins came from the groups base differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions mentioned above.  

 EMGs sales totaled $937.1 million for 2007, an increase of $134.3 million or 16.7% from $802.8 million in 2006. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 6%, excluding a favorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EMGs differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of Pittman, SAI, SCP, Umeco R&O and Hamilton accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EMGs operating income was $167.2 million for 2007, an increase of $27.3 million or 19.5% when compared with $139.9 million in 2006. EMGs increase in operating income was due to strength in the groups differentiated businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above. EMGs operating margins were 17.8% of sales for 2007 compared with 17.4% of sales in 2006. The increase in operating margins was primarily due to an increased contribution from the groups differentiated businesses.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $247.3 million in 2008, a decrease of $31.2 million or 11.2% when compared with $278.5 million in 2007. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily the result of higher defined benefit pension plan contributions of $79.9 million in 2008, a $74.7 million increase over the $5.2 million contributed in 2007. The 2008 contributions had the effect of eliminating or significantly reducing the amount of unfunded pension obligations associated with the Companys pension plans. Also impacting operating cash flow are higher overall operating working capital levels necessary to grow the Company, partially offset by higher earnings. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital spending) was $203.1 million in 2008, compared to $240.9 million in 2007. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $489.4 million in 2008, which includes the fourth quarter of 2008 pre-tax restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $40.0 million, compared with $433.9 million in 2007, a 12.8% improvement. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 28   
 Cash used for investing activities totaled $496.6 million in 2008, compared with $334.7 million in 2007. In 2008, the Company paid $463.0 million for six business acquisitions and one technology line acquisition, net of cash received, compared with $300.6 million paid for seven business acquisitions and one technology line, net of cash received in 2007. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $44.2 million in 2008, compared with $37.6 million in 2007.  

 Cash provided by financing activities totaled $173.5 million in 2008, compared with $174.1 million in 2007. In 2008, net total borrowings increased by $266.9 million, compared with a net total increase of $180.9 million in 2007. Short-term borrowings increased $69.7 million in 2008, compared with a decrease of $162.6 million in 2007. Long-term borrowings increased $197.2 million in 2008, compared to an increase of $343.4 million in 2007.  

 In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million 7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.  

 In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million, consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due December 2018. The senior notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.93%. The senior notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt-to-EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility.  

 In May 2008, the accounts receivable securitization facility was amended and restated, extending the expiration date from May 2008 to May 2009, and bringing the borrowing capacity to $100 million from $110 million previously. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2008.  

 In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second funding occurred in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018. The notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the first funding of the notes were used to pay down borrowings outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility, which included a foreign portion related to the 2007 acquisition of Cameca and the 2006 acquisition of Land Instruments, as well as borrowings outstanding under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program. Additionally, the proceeds from the private placement were used to purchase California Instruments in December 2007. The proceeds from the second funding of the notes were used to pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility.  

 In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility, increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility from October 2011 to June 2012. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $468.9 million available under its revolving credit facility, including the $100 million accordion feature.  

 At December 31, 2008, total debt outstanding was $1,111.7 million, compared with $903.0 million at December 31, 2007. The debt-to-capital ratio was 46.3% at December 31, 2008, compared with 42.1% at December 31, 2007. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders equity) was 44.3% at December 31, 2008, compared with 37.1% at December 31, 2007. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third  

 29   
 parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 Additional financing activities for 2008 include the receipt of net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $7.5 million compared with $17.2 million in 2007. Cash dividends paid were $25.7 million in both 2008 and 2007. In 2008, the Company repaid $21.4 million in life insurance policy loans.  

 Repurchases of 1.3 million shares of the Companys common stock in 2008 totaled $57.4 million, compared with a total of $5.4 million paid for approximately 144,000 shares repurchased in 2007. On January 24, 2008, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $50 million in the authorization for the repurchase of the Companys common stock, adding to the $25.9 million that remained available at December 31, 2007 from an existing $50 million authorization approved in March 2003 for a total of $75.9 million. On July 23, 2008, the Board of Directors approved another increase of $50 million in the authorization for the repurchase of the Companys common stock, adding to the $18.5 million that remained available at June 30, 2008 from the existing $50 million authorization approved in January 2008 for a total of $68.5 million. At December 31, 2008, $68.5 million was available under the current Board authorization for future share repurchases.  

 The following table summarizes AMETEKs contractual cash obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future years at December 31, 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)    Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007 and the $350 million private placement completed in 2008.  

  (2)    Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca acquisition. The lease has a term of twelve years, which began July 2006, and is payable quarterly.  

  (3)    Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.  

  (4)    The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.   

 Other Commitments  

 The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $16.4 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2008. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.  

 The Company may, from time to time, repurchase its long-term debt in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon availability, market conditions and other factors.  

 30   
 As a result of all of the Companys cash flow activities in 2008, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 totaled $87.0 million, compared with $170.1 million at December 31, 2007. The Companys liquidity has not been impacted by the recent financial crisis nor do we expect liquidity to be impacted in the near future. Additionally, the Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants, which includes its financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to managements discussion and analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 31   
      sheet at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.    

       Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets. The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Under SFAS 142, purchased goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. These impairment tests include the projection and discounting of cash flows, estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued and estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets being tested. SFAS 142 requires a two-step impairment test for goodwill. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record such impairment losses. Indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill are tested by estimating the fair values of those assets as of the Companys measurement date, with such fair values based on expected future operating performance and discount rates determined by management. Changes in interest rates and market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. These estimates will likely change over time. The Companys acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2008, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $1,681.8 million, or 55.0% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2008 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.   

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The Company accounts for all of its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158) for balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the income statement recognition of the costs related to these plans. SFAS 87 and SFAS 158 require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2008, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments. The discount rate used in determining the 2008 pension cost was 6.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.89% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2008 and determining the 2009 defined benefit pension cost is 6.50% for U.S. plans and 6.09% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2008 of 8.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 7.0% for foreign plans. The Company will continue to use these rates for 2009 for the U.S. and foreign plans, respectively. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in    

 32   
      determining the 2008 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and will remain unchanged in 2009. For foreign plans, the rate of compensation increase will be decreased from 3.86% in 2008 to 2.98% in 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $6.8 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans as compared with pre-tax pension income of $3.8 million recognized for these plans in 2007. The Company estimates its 2009 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans pre-tax expense to be $15.4 million.    

 The Company follows the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS 158. Under SFAS 158, all unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. In addition, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, the measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligation are measured) is required to be the Companys fiscal year end. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans as required by SFAS 158.  

 To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during 2008 which totaled $79.9 million, compared with $5.2 million in 2007. The Company anticipates making approximately $19 million to $24 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.    

 The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. In accordance with FIN 48, the Company is required to assess the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice.  

 As a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), the Company recorded a $4.7 million increase in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties of $2.4 million, a decrease of $1.2 million in goodwill related to a previous business combination and a $5.9 million charge to the January 1, 2007 opening balance of retained earnings. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

 33   
 Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards  

 Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS 157 for fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis (at least annually). The deferral applies to fair value in goodwill impairment testing, indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment testing, asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value, and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination. Therefore, the Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  

 SFAS 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Companys own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

 At December 31, 2008, $0.3 million of the Companys cash and cash equivalents and $4.2 million of marketable securities are valued as level 1 investments. The Company held $8.5 million valued as level 2 investments in the investments and other assets line of the consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2008, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not material.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). This statement significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions in the Companys consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early adoption. Upon adoption, SFAS 141R will not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, depending on the nature of an acquisition or the quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption, SFAS 141R may significantly impact the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows when compared to acquisitions accounted for under existing U.S. GAAP and result in more earnings volatility and generally lower earnings due to, among other items, the expensing of deal costs and restructuring costs of acquired companies.  

 In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 08-7, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets (EITF 08-7). EITF 08-7 clarifies how to account for acquired defensive intangible assets subsequent to initial measurement under SFAS 141R that the Company does not intend to actively use but does intend to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset. EITF 08-7 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, along with SFAS 141R. The Company has evaluated EITF 08-7 and does not expect the adoption of EITF 08-7 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling (minority) interests in the Companys consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have an impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 34   
 In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. FSP FAS 142-3 is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141R, and other U.S. GAAP. FSP FAS 142-3 applies to all intangible assets and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has evaluated FSP FAS 142-3 and does not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 Internal Reinvestment  

 Capital Expenditures  

 Capital expenditures were $44.2 million or 1.7% of sales in 2008, compared with $37.6 million or 1.8% of sales in 2007. 54% of the expenditures in 2008 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2008 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2009 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 2.0% of sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.  

 Product Development and Engineering  

 The Company is committed to research, product development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, product development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $115.9 million, $102.9 million and $87.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $6.1 million, $7.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $57.5 million, $52.9 million and $42.0 million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.  

 Environmental Matters  

 Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2008, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the  

 35   
 amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

 Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $28.4 million and $25.3 million, respectively, for non-owned and owned sites. In 2008, the Company provided $7.3 million of additional reserves, including $5.6 million for existing sites and $1.7 million related to recent acquisitions. Additionally, the Company spent $4.2 million on environmental matters in 2008. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 include reserves of $17.9 million and $18.0 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2008, the Company has $12.4 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for up to $19.0 million of additional costs.  

 The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the following paragraph.  

 In October 2008, the Company received a Notice of Administrative Civil Liability from the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board seeking certain penalties. The Notice claims that a former subsidiary of AMETEK, which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, failed to adequately produce a delineation report and feasibility study within specified time frames. We believe we have good and valid defenses to this claim and intend to vigorously defend against it.  

 The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  

 Market Risk  

 The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  

 The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

 36   
 The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

 Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

 Forward-Looking Information  

 Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
