ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2017, we have an interest rate swap on a $407,000,000 mortgage loan on Two Penn Plaza that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.65% (3.01% as of December 31, 2017) to a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018, an interest rate swap on a $375,000,000 mortgage loan on 888 Seventh Avenue that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.60% (2.96% as of December 31, 2017) to a fixed rate of 3.15% through December 2020 and an interest rate swap on a $700,000,000 mortgage loan on 770 Broadway that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.75% (3.15% as of December 31, 2017) to a fixed rate of 2.56% through September 2020.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $9,822,000,000.
