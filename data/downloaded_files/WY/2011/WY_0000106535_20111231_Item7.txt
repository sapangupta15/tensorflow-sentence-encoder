ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS

In 2011, the U.S. economy slowed its pace of recovery. The underlying causes included the Japan earthquake and tsunami, the U.S. deficit and related political instability and European debt crisis. These factors weighed heavily on the economy, delaying many anticipated improvements in key economic indicators. The U.S. housing market continues to be affected by these events and consequently lags other sectors in the recovery. Improvement in the latter part of 2011 in key areas such as job creation, industrial production and GDP may help spur growth in U.S. housing; however, the sector remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified home buyers. The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberlands segments. Real Estate focuses on building single family homes. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.

HOUSING MARKET

We track certain indicators such as employment, consumer confidence, housing starts, home sales, foreclosures, home prices, mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions. The following market statements refer to industry conditions in general and not to Weyerhaeuser operations directly.

Total U.S. housing starts for 2011 were 606 thousand units, with single family units accounting for 429 thousand of the total. This represents a 9 percent decline in single family starts from 2010; however demand for homes was bolstered by government programs such as the new home buyer tax credit for part of the year in 2010. These programs were not renewed in 2011. Multifamily construction did relatively better in 2011 compared with 2010, averaging 177 thousand units compared with 114 thousand in 2010. In total, current housing demand remains well below 1 million or more single family starts, the typical level during the 15-year period of 1992-2007. New home sales in the U.S. totaled 303 thousand units in 2011. This level of new home sales is 6 percent lower than 2010 and lower than any year recorded since 1963, when U.S. Census started reporting this data. Through much of 2011 the unemployment rate has remained above 9 percent, but as of December had fallen to 8.5 percent, the lowest level for the year. Weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence, limiting any growth in demand for housing and wood products. The number of mortgages in default remains very large and the number of foreclosures is expected to remain high relative to historic trends. This will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes for sale, which limits demand for new homes.

Demand for wood products continued to be affected by the depressed level of new home construction in 2011. Overall demand levels for lumber increased 3 percent from 2010 while demand for oriented strand board (OSB), which is more heavily dependent on residential construction, increased 1.5 percent from 2010 levels. Demand for both lumber and OSB remain 35 percent to 40 percent below peak levels. As a result, industry operating rates for lumber and OSB have averaged between 70 and 80 percent of capacity. Prices for some commodity wood products were modestly higher in 2011, while others such as southern yellow pine lumber and OSB were lower in 2011 than in 2010. In 2011, most prices peaked in the second quarter, coinciding with the strongest quarter of construction, but decreased to levels closer to their costs of production for much of the year. Demand for logs increased as lumber production increased slightly. In the western region, weak domestic demand for logs was offset by demand from Japan, China and Korea, resulting in significant increases in western log prices in 2011.

U.S. DOLLAR/GLOBAL DEMAND

The U.S. dollar remained weak relative to most developed world currencies during 2011. Cellulose Fibers benefited from the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to European, Canadian and South American producers. The combination of the weaker dollar, steady global demand and flat capacity helped prices for the key indicator, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp, to remain above $950/ton in 2011, 2 percent higher than in 2010. Pulp prices started the year similar to 2010, peaking in the second quarter and then declining into the fourth quarter, largely as a result of a weakening euro. Debt concerns in the Eurozone countries has lowered the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, reducing the competiveness of U.S. producers relative to European competitors, causing a decline in the key NBSK indicator price in the fourth quarter.

The weaker dollar compared to the yen resulted in U.S. logs being less expensive to importers in Japan. Although Japan experienced a major disruption with the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, total housing starts in Japan increased 3 percent from 2010 levels as rebuilding efforts began in the second half of the year. The export log market was affected by increased demand from China. Chinese imports of softwood logs from the U.S. were estimated to exceed 5 million cubic meters for 2011, double the level from 2010.

WHERE WE ARE HEADED

Growth in the U.S. economy improved to 2.8 percent in fourth quarter 2011 compared to 1.8 percent in third quarter 2011 and that momentum is expected to continue into 2012. Job growth also has shown gradual improvement in the latter part of 2011 and the U.S. is expected to add enough jobs to lower the overall unemployment rate in 2012. Single-family starts are expected to gradually increase in 2012, a result of improving demand for homes and record low inventory of new homes for sale. Demand for wood products is expected to increase as a result of greater demand for housing; however sustainable demand growth is expected to be modest in 2012. As a result, prices in 2012 are expected to be similar to 2011. Log prices in western markets are expected to remain flat, exclusive of seasonal swings. In the South, log prices are also expected to remain flat, but at lower levels than the West, which benefits from strong demand from Asia. The U.S. dollar is expected to remain weak relative to developed currencies outside of the euro, which is expected to continue to be affected by uncertainty in the Eurozone. Weakness in the euro is expected to undermine the competitive position of U.S. market pulp producers and will likely put downward pressure on prices.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) ELECTION

Starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. A significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment. We are, however, subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS), which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and our non-qualified timberland segment income. Following are points related to our conversion:

•To implement our decision to be taxed as a REIT, we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits, determined under federal income tax provisions, as a “Special Dividend.” On September 1, 2010, we paid a dividend of $5.6 billion which included the Special Dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately $11 million. At the election of each shareholder, the Special Dividend was paid in cash or Weyerhaeuser common shares. The aggregate amount of cash distributed was $560 million and the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million.

•The stock portion of the Special Dividend is treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings (loss) per share only for periods after the distribution. Prior periods are not restated. The required treatment results in earnings (loss) per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued.

•We reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities, which resulted in a benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010 of approximately $1,064 million. Our 2010 effective income tax rate also decreased due to lower taxes on REIT qualifying timberlands income.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

HOW WE DID IN 2011

Summary of Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $262 million — 4 percent — primarily due to the following:

• Timberlands segment sales increased $170 million, as a result of higher log prices and volumes sold;

• Cellulose Fibers segment sales increased $147 million, as a result of higher pulp prices and volumes sold; and

• Wood Products segment sales from continuing operations increased $52 million, as a result of increased volumes sold of structural lumber and OSB.

These increases were partially offset by an $85 million decrease in Real Estate segment sales, as a result of fewer home closings.

Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $950 million — 74 percent — primarily due to certain significant benefits in 2010 that were not repeated in 2011, including:

• $1,064 million reversal of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our conversion to a REIT in 2010;

• $149 million cellulosic biofuel producer credit in 2010; and

• $46 million gain on the sale of five short line railroads in 2010.

These decreases in our earnings were partially offset by:

•$96 million net gain on sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2011;

•$76 million tax benefit related to foreign tax credits in 2011;

•$68 million decrease in interest expense due to lower charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt and lower interest expense due to a lower level of debt;

•$65 million decrease in restructuring, closure and asset impairment charges, primarily due to decreased impairments recognized in our Wood Products segment; and

•$49 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $886 million — 17 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Cellulose Fibers segment sales increased $400 million, as a result of higher pulp sales realizations;

•Wood Products segment sales from continuing operations increased $302 million, as a result of increased price realizations and sales volumes for residential building products; and

•Timberlands segment sales increased $160 million, as a result of increased price realizations for log sales in the West and increased land exchanges, dispositions of non-strategic timberlands and sales of higher and better-use lands.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 34
Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased $1,826 million primarily due to the following:

•$943 increase in income tax benefit, primarily due to $1,064 million reversal of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our conversion to a REIT in 2010 and a tax benefit of $149 million for cellulosic biofuel producer credits in 2010, partially offset by a reduced income tax benefit due to having earnings before tax in 2010 compared to a loss in 2009;

•$716 million increase in gross margin, primarily due to higher domestic and export prices in our Timberlands segment, increased price realizations for OSB and structural lumber in our Wood Products segment, increased price realizations for pulp in our Cellulose Fibers segment and increased contributions from single-family closings and land and lot sales in our Real Estate segment, partially offset by increased operating costs in our Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments;

•$542 million decrease in restructuring, closure and asset impairment charges, primarily due to charges recognized in our Timberlands, Wood Products, Real Estate and Corporate and Other segments in 2009; and

•$52 million increase in net earnings from discontinued operations. 

The increases were partially offset by the following:

•$344 million tax benefit for alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009 and

•$98 million net gain on sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in 2009.

TIMBERLANDS

HOW WE DID IN 2011

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Timberlands.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers, intersegment sales, and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Timberlands 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 35
COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net Sales and Revenues — Unaffiliated Customers

Net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $170 million — 19 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Western log sales increased by $131 million due to increased sales volumes of 18 percent and increased price realizations of 12 percent as a result of strong export demand.

•Southern log sales increased by $51 million due to increased sales volumes of 45 percent resulting from increased harvest levels and increased sales of logs to third parties.

•Sales from our International operations increased by $21 million, primarily due to increased plywood sales volumes of 34 percent.

The above items were partially offset by a decrease of $29 million in land exchanges and higher and better-use land sales.

Intersegment Sales

Intersegment sales increased $43 million — 7 percent — primarily due to the following:

•$28 million increase due to increased Canadian log and chip sales volumes and

•$15 million increase due to higher log prices and sales volumes in the West partially offset by lower log prices and sales volumes in the South.

Net contribution to earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $203 million — 72 percent — primarily due to the following:

•$152 million pretax gain on the first quarter 2011 sale of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in southwestern Washington;

•$77 million increase, primarily due to higher domestic and export prices in the West; and

•$59 million increase, primarily due to an increase in harvest levels of 18 percent in the West and 19 percent in the South.

These items were partially offset by:

•$33 million increase in operating costs, primarily due to higher fuel and silviculture costs;

•$23 million decrease due to fewer land exchanges and higher and better-use land sales; and

•$20 million decrease due to lower prices for logs in the South.

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009

Net Sales and Revenues — Unaffiliated Customers

Net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $160 million primarily due to the following:

•Western log sales increased $85 million due to increased price realizations of 26 percent.

•Land exchanges, dispositions of non-strategic timberlands and sales of higher and better-use lands increased $54 million.

•Sales from our International operations increased $21 million due to improvement in prices across most products and increased sales volumes.

Intersegment Sales

Intersegment sales increased $66 million, primarily due to the following:

•$49 million increase due to increased Canadian log and chip sales volumes and

•$17 million increase due to an increase in U.S. log prices.

Net contribution to earnings

The $56 million decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted primarily from the following:

•$163 million pre-tax gain on the third quarter 2009 sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon;

•$30 million decrease resulting from increased incentive compensation and increased allocations of corporate costs to the business segments;

•$24 million decrease due to decreased harvest levels of 9 percent in the South and 12 percent in the West; and

•$17 million increase in operating costs, which includes higher road maintenance and increased fuel costs.

These items were partially offset by:

•$125 million increase, primarily due to higher domestic and export prices;

•$27 million increase due to land exchanges, dispositions of non-strategic timberlands and sales of higher and better-use lands; and

•$25 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments.

OUR OUTLOOK

Excluding earnings from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, we expect slightly higher earnings from the Timberlands segment in first quarter 2012 as compared to fourth quarter 2011. We anticipate increased fee harvest volumes in the West and slightly improved average selling prices due to a higher percentage of export logs sold to Japan. We also anticipate higher fuel costs and seasonally higher silviculture expenses.

WOOD PRODUCTS

HOW WE DID IN 2011

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Wood Products business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Wood Products.

We sold our hardwoods operations in a transaction that closed on August 1, 2011. The hardwoods results are included in our Wood Products segment and results of discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Wood Products

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

During 2011, we recognized $29 million of impairment charges in the Wood Products segment primarily related to the decision to permanently close four engineered lumber facilities that had been previously indefinitely closed. These facilities are located in Albany, Oregon; Dodson, Louisiana; Pine Hill, Alabama; and Simsboro, Louisiana. Total restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges in 2011 for the segment were $64 million. This compares with total Wood Products restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges of $114 million in 2010.

Net Sales and Revenues, Including Discontinued Operations

Net sales and revenues decreased $93 million — 4 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Structural lumber average price realizations decreased 3 percent as a result of:

– An 11 percent decrease in southern yellow pine realizations. In 2011, southern yellow pine accounted for 50 percent of the sales volume from our sawmills.

– This was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in Douglas fir realizations.

•OSB average price realizations decreased 14 percent.

•Engineered solid section shipment volumes decreased 10 percent.

•Engineered I-joints shipment volumes decreased 12 percent.

•Hardwood lumber sales decreased due to the sale of our hardwoods operations.

•Other products purchased for resale decreased primarily as a result of ceasing to offer a composite decking product line and the sale of our hardwoods operations.

These items were partially offset by the following:

•Structural lumber shipment volumes increased 7 percent.

•OSB shipment volumes increased 25 percent, primarily due to the re-opening of our Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan facility. 

•Engineered I-joists average price realizations increased 7 percent.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 37
Net Contribution to Earnings, Including Discontinued Operations

Net contribution to earnings increased $40 million — 13 percent — primarily due to the following:

•$74 million decrease in manufacturing costs, primarily due to increased operating rates;

•$64 million decrease in selling and administrative costs, primarily due to previous cost reduction efforts and the sale of our hardwoods operations;

•$50 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments; and

•$32 million increase in by-product sales.

These changes were partially offset by the following:

•$62 million decrease due to lower sales price realizations, primarily for OSB and structural lumber;

•$43 million increase in freight expense due to higher fuel cost and increasing shipments of OSB and structural lumber;

•$40 million pretax gain on the sale of certain British Columbia forest licenses and associated rights in 2010;

•$22 million increase in charges related to the sale of our hardwoods operations; and

•$16 million increase in log costs as domestic prices increased in the West as a result of strong export demand.

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009

Net Sales and Revenues, Including Discontinued Operations

The $357 million increase in net sales and revenues was primarily due to the following:

•Structural lumber average price realizations increased 22 percent.

•OSB average price realizations increased 27 percent and shipment volumes increased 12 percent.

•Softwood plywood average price realizations increased 8 percent and shipment volumes increased 17 percent.

•Hardwood lumber shipment volumes increased 8 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings, Including Discontinued Operations

The $423 million improvement in net contribution to earnings was primarily due to the following:

•$276 million increase due to sales price realizations, primarily OSB and structural lumber;

•$63 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments;

•$59 million decrease in manufacturing and other costs of sales as a result of increased operating efficiencies and cost reductions;

•$52 million increase in the net pretax gain on the sale of assets and operations, including the sale of certain British Columbia forest licenses and associated rights;

•$35 million decrease in selling and administrative costs, primarily due to staff reductions in 2009; and

•$13 million decrease in litigation charges, primarily due to the settlement of Alder litigation in 2009.

These improvements were partially offset by a $64 million increase in log costs.

OUR OUTLOOK

Excluding special items, we anticipate a smaller loss from the Wood Products segment in first quarter 2012 as compared to fourth quarter 2011. We expect slightly higher selling prices for lumber and OSB and increased sales volumes across all product lines. Unit manufacturing costs should decline due to seasonally improved operating rates.

CELLULOSE FIBERS

HOW WE DID IN 2011 

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Cellulose Fibers business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Cellulose Fibers.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Cellulose Fibers

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 38
COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010 

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $147 million — 8 percent — primarily due to the following:

•Pulp price realizations increased $52 per ton — 6 percent — primarily due to lower global softwood pulp inventories in the first half of the year and a change in sales mix to higher valued products;

•Sales volumes for pulp increased 42,000 tons — 2 percent; and

•Liquid packaging board price realizations increased $82 per ton — 8 percent — due to a favorable shift in product mix to coated board sales and an increase in market price.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $23 million — 6 percent — primarily due to the following:

•$92 million increase due to higher pulp price realizations;

•$24 million improvement in liquid packaging board price realizations; and

•$13 million increase in other non operating income, which includes earnings from an equity affiliate.

Partially offsetting these increases in earnings are the following:

•$57 million increase, primarily due to rising fiber and chemical costs;

•$41 million increase in operating costs, maintenance, freight, energy and the effect on Canadian operating costs of the weakening U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar; and

•$12 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs. 

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009 

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $400 million primarily due to the following:

•Pulp price realizations increased $192 per ton — 28 percent — primarily due to tight global softwood pulp inventories, due in part to lower industry production in the first half of 2010 as a result of the Chilean earthquake that occurred in February 2010.

•Sales volumes for pulp increased 17,000 tons — 1 percent.

•Liquid packaging board price realizations increased $80 per ton — 8 percent — primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix to coated board.

•Sales volumes for liquid packaging board increased approximately 23,000 tons — 8 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $32 million primarily due to the following:

•$344 million decrease due to alternative fuel mixture credits, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash From Operations” for more information related to the alternative fuel mixture credits;

•$69 million increase in operating costs, freight and the effect on Canadian operating costs of the weakening U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar; and

•$11 million increase in general and administrative cost.

Partially offsetting these decreases in earnings were the following increases:

•$330 million increase due to higher pulp price realizations,

•$24 million increase in other product realizations,

•$25 million increase due to higher liquid packaging board price realizations and

•$12 million in other non operating income.

OUR OUTLOOK

We expect substantially lower earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in first quarter 2012 as compared to fourth quarter 2011. We anticipate considerably lower average selling prices for pulp and significantly higher maintenance costs due to scheduled annual maintenance outages. We also expect seasonally higher energy costs and increased fiber and chemical costs.

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Real Estate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased $85 million — 9 percent — primarily due to:

•Home closings declined 10 percent to 1,912 in 2011 from 2,125 in 2010.

•Revenues from land and other sales decreased $11 million.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $33 million — 36 percent — primarily due to:

•$33 million decrease in contribution from the sale of partnership interests — first quarter 2010 included the sale

of interests in two commercial partnerships;

•$25 million decrease — 12 percent — in contribution from single-family operations, primarily due to fewer home closings; and

•$9 million decrease in contribution from partnerships interests.

These decreases were partially offset by the following improvements:

•$16 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, resulting from both lower closing volumes and ongoing cost reduction efforts;

•$11 million related to contingent loss reserves – 2011 included net income from reserve adjustments for settled matters compared to net charges in 2010; and

•$10 million decrease in impairments and restructuring charges.

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues increased $19 million — 2 percent — primarily from:

•$10 million increase in single-family housing revenues, primarily due to a shift in product mix; and 

– The average price of homes closed improved to $396,000 in 2010 from $382,000 in 2009.

– This was partially offset by a 2 percent decline in home closings — 2010 included closings of 2,125 compared to 2,177 in 2009.

•$9 million net increase in land and other revenues, primarily related to the sale of an apartment building in 2010.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $390 million, primarily due to:

•$264 million decrease in impairments, restructuring and other related charges;

•$56 million increase — 37 percent — in contribution from single-family closings. The net contribution reflects a $60 million benefit as a result of improved margins due to the mix of homes closed, partially offset by a $4 million decrease as a result of fewer closings;

•$24 million increase in contributions from sales of partnership interests — 2010 included gains of $33 million on sales compared to $9 million in 2009;

•$23 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales; and

•$19 million decrease in selling and general and administrative expenses due to cost cutting measures, including reductions in headcount.

OUR OUTLOOK 

We anticipate a loss from single-family homebuilding operations in first quarter 2012 as compared to fourth quarter 2011. We expect a seasonal decline in home closing volume and lower average margins due to mix.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contributions to Earnings for Corporate and Other

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

HOW WE DID IN 2011 

Corporate and Other includes certain gains or charges that are not related to an individual operating segment and the portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and postretirement costs, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses associated with financing and other general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the business segments. Historically, Corporate and Other included the results of our transportation operations. This included our five short line railroads that were sold at the end of 2010 and Westwood Shipping Lines that was sold on September 30, 2011. Westwood results are included in our results of discontinued operations.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010 

Net Sales and Revenues, Including Discontinued Operations

Net sales and revenues decreased $73 million — 29 percent — primarily due to the sale of our transportation operations. 

Net Contribution to Earnings, Including Discontinued Operations

Net contribution to earnings decreased $118 million, primarily due to the following:

•$100 million increase in pension and postretirement costs, primarily due to the amortization of deferred pension losses;

•$46 million gain on the sale of our five short line railroads recognized in 2010; 

•$16 million decrease in foreign exchange, primarily as a result of a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; 

•$14 million decrease in transportation contribution to earnings as a result of the sale of these operations; and

•$11 million increase in environmental remediation expense related to discontinued operations.

These items were partially offset by the following:

•$49 million gain on the sale of Westwood Shipping Lines in 2011 and

•$10 million decrease in share-based compensation expense.

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009

Net Sales and Revenues, Including Discontinued Operations

Net sales and revenues increased $88 million— 53 percent — primarily due to increased revenues from Westwood operations as a result of higher volumes and prices.

Net Contribution to Earnings, Including Discontinued Operations

Net contribution to earnings increased $178 million, primarily due to the following:

•$183 million decrease in charges for asset impairments and corporate restructuring activities;

•$46 million gain on the sale of our five short line railroads recognized in 2010; and

•$32 million increase in earnings from transportation operations, primarily from Westwood operations.

These items were partially offset by the following:

•$29 million decrease related to litigation and insurance reimbursements received in 2009;

•$28 million decrease in foreign exchange, primarily resulting from a smaller change in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and

•$18 million decrease related to the 2009 sale of a Honolulu box plant site.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Our net interest expense incurred for the last three years was:

•$384 million in 2011,

•$452 million in 2010 and

•$462 million in 2009.

Reductions in our amount of outstanding debt was:

•$583 million in 2011,

•$627 million in 2010 and

•$327 million in 2009.

In connection with the repayments, included in our net interest expense, we recognized the following pretax losses on early extinguishment of debt:

•$26 million in 2011,

•$50 million in 2010 and

•$28 million in 2009.

INCOME TAXES

Our benefit for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years was:

•$62 million in 2011,

•$1,192 million in 2010 and

•$249 million in 2009.

During 2011, we recorded the following tax benefits or charges:

•$76 million tax benefit related to foreign tax credits associated with the repatriation of Canadian earnings,

•$57 million tax charge resulting from the sale of non-strategic timberlands and

•$10 million tax benefit due to the early extinguishment of debt.

During 2010, we recorded the following tax benefits or charges:

•We reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our conversion to a REIT, which resulted in a benefit of $1,064 million.

•We recorded a tax benefit of $149 million for cellulosic biofuel producer credits; see “Fuel Credits” for more information.

•We recorded a $32 million tax charge as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act and a change in our postretirement medical plan.

There were no one-time deferred tax benefits or charges during 2009.

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate level tax on income of the REIT that is distributed to shareholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRS, which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and the portion of our timberlands segment income included in the TRS.

The table below summarizes the historical tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:

•protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and

•have access at all times to major financial markets.

CASH FROM OPERATIONS

Cash from operations includes:

•cash received from customers;

•cash paid to employees, suppliers and others;

•cash paid for interest on our debt; and

•cash paid or received for taxes.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 42
Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) our operations was:

•$291 million in 2011,

•$689 million in 2010 and

•$(203) million in 2009.

COMPARING 2011 WITH 2010

Net cash provided by operations decreased $398 million in 2011 as compared with 2010:

•Net cash inflows related to income taxes decreased $481 million. We paid taxes of $28 million in 2011 and received $453 million in 2010.

•Cash paid to employees, suppliers and others increased $144 million.

Partially offsetting the above decreases were:

•Pension and postretirement contributions decreased $137 million. These contributions were $143 million in 2011 compared to $280 million in 2010.

•Cash we received from customers increased $80 million, primarily due to increased net sales and revenues from our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments partially offset by decreased net sales in our Wood Products, Real Estate and Corporate and Other segments.

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009

Net cash used in operations increased $892 million in 2010 as compared with 2009:

•Cash we received from customers increased approximately $864 million primarily due to increased net sales and revenues from our Wood Products, Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Corporate and Other segments.

•Consolidated cash received for income taxes increased $495 million as compared to 2009. We received taxes of $453 million in 2010 and paid $42 million in 2009.

Partially offsetting the above increases were:

•Cash paid to employees, suppliers and others increased $312 million.

•Pension and postretirement contributions increased $165 million. These contributions were $280 million in 2010 compared to $115 million in 2009.

Fuel Credits

During 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed a $0.50 per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayer’s trade or business. In 2009, we had 688 million gallons of qualifying alternative fuel mixture, resulting in $344 million of credits. The alternative fuel mixture credit expired on December 31, 2009.

In 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor sold or used in 2009 qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit. Black liquor potentially qualifies for either the cellulosic biofuel producer credit or the alternative fuel mixture credit (but not both on the same gallon of black liquor). During 2009, we produced approximately 238 million gallons of black liquor, which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit. This equals $240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel producer credit at $1.01 per gallon, or $149 million net of tax, which we recognized in fourth quarter 2010. 

INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS

Cash from investing activities includes:

•acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation;

•investments in or distribution from equity affiliates;

•proceeds from sale of assets and operations; and

•purchases and redemptions of short-term investments.

The pension trust repaid net amounts of $146 million in 2010 and $54 million in 2009 of short-term loans made in 2008 and 2009.

Three-Year Summary of Capital Spending by Business Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We anticipate that our net capital expenditures for 2012 — excluding acquisitions — will be approximately $260 million to $290 million. However, that amount could change due to:

•future economic conditions,

•weather and

•timing of equipment purchases.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:

•historical experience and

•assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:

•pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•potential impairments of long-lived assets;

•legal, environmental and product liability reserves; and

•depletion accounting.

Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 46
PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:

•discount rates,

•expected long-term rate of return,

•anticipated trends in health care costs,

•assumed increases in salaries and

•mortality rates.

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:

•actual pension fund performance,

•level of lump sum distributions,

•plan changes,

•changes in plan participation or coverage and

•portfolio changes and restructuring.

This section provides more information about our:

•expected long-term rate of return,

•discount rates and

•cash contributions.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return 

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. 

After considering available information at the end of 2011, we reduced our expected long-term rate of return from 9.5 percent to 9.0 percent. Factors we considered include:

•the 14.8 percent net compounded annual return achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy over the past 27 years and

•current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.

The revised rate will affect the amount of net periodic benefit costs that we record in 2012. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$19 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.

Discount Rates 

Our discount rates as of December 31, 2011, are:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2012 will be based on the 4.5 percent and 4.1 percent assumed discount rates for U.S. plans and the 4.9 percent and 4.8 percent assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.

Our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$27 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Contributions Made and Benefits Paid 

During 2011:

•We contributed approximately $82 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans in accordance with minimum funding rules and respective provincial regulations. 

•We contributed approximately $21 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.

•We made benefit payments of approximately $40 million related to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 47
During 2012:

Based on estimated year-end assets and projections of plan liabilities we expect to:

•have a required contribution for our U.S. qualified plan for 2012 of approximately $60 million, which is payable by September 15, 2013;

•be required to contribute approximately $83 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans;

•contribute $20 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans; and

•make benefit payments of $42 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our books.

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets.

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:

•future cash flows,

•residual values and

•fair values of the assets.

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:

•probability of alternative outcomes,

•product pricing,

•raw material costs,

•product sales and

•discount rate.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: REAL ESTATE

We review homebuilding long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We recorded long-lived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders of $11 million in 2011, $21 million in 2010 and $261 million in 2009.

Real Estate In Process of Development and Land Being Processed for Development

Real estate in process of development and land being processed for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities (MPCs). MPCs typically include several product segments such as residential, active adult, retail and commercial. We evaluate impairment at the subdivision or MPC product segment level. Factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or MPC product segment for impairment include:

•gross margins and selling costs on homes closed in recent months;

•projected gross margins and selling costs based on our operating budgets;

•competitor pricing and incentives in the same or nearby communities; and

•trends in average selling prices, discounts, incentives, sales velocity and cancellations.

We update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and MPC product segment that may be impaired. The undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by community-specific factors that include:

•estimates and timing of future revenues;

•estimates and timing of future land development, materials, labor and contractor costs;

•community location and desirability, including availability of schools, retail, mass transit and other services;

•local economic and demographic trends regarding employment, new jobs and taxes;

•competitor presence, product types, future competition, pricing, incentives and discounts; and

•land availability, number of lots we own or control, entitlement restrictions and alternative uses.

The carrying amount of each subdivision and MPC product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or MPC product segment. An impairment charge for a subdivision or MPC product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot.

Real Estate for Sale

Real estate for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell. We regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans.

The carrying amount of real estate for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount. The fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions, demographic factors and competitor actions, and is inherently uncertain. Actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates. The carrying amount of real estate for sale is evaluated quarterly.

Market Approach

We use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate assets when information for comparable assets is available. This approach is commonly used for completed inventory and individual assets for sale. We typically use:

•sales prices for comparable assets,

•market studies,

•appraisals or

•legitimate offers.

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2011 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 48
Income Approach

We generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects and assets in process of development. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. Discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in 2011 ranged from 15 percent to 18 percent. The income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

We record contingent liabilities when:

•it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and

•the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:

•historical experience,

•judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and

•recommendations of legal counsel.

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.

While we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. See Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

DEPLETION

We record depletion — the costs attributed to timber harvested — as trees are harvested.

To calculate our depletion rate, which is updated annually, we:

•take the total carrying cost of the timber and

•divide by the total timber volume estimated to be harvested during the harvest cycle.

Estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors:

•changes in weather patterns,

•effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications,

•changes in environmental regulations and restrictions,

•limits on harvesting certain timberlands,

•changes in harvest plans,

•scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology and

•changes in harvest cycles.

In addition, the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.

Depletion-rate calculations do not include estimates for:

•future silviculture — or sustainable forest management — costs associated with existing stands;

•future reforestation costs associated with a stand’s final harvest; and

•future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.

PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Currently there are no significant prospective accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on us.
