Item 1. Business.  

GENERAL  

Overview. Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company located primarily in the Americas that provides its services through the business units described below.  

In the second quarter of 2006, Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) consummated a merger which combined the Duke Energy and Cinergy regulated franchises, as well as deregulated generation in the Midwestern United States.  

Duke Energy Holding Corp. (Duke Energy HC) was incorporated in Delaware on May 3, 2005 as Deer Holding Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation (Old Duke Energy, for purposes of this discussion regarding the merger). On April 3, 2006, in accordance with the merger agreement, Old Duke Energy and Cinergy merged into wholly-owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy HC, resulting in Duke Energy HC becoming the parent entity. In connection with the closing of the merger transactions, Duke Energy HC changed its name to Duke Energy Corporation (New Duke Energy or Duke Energy) and Old Duke Energy converted into a limited liability company named Duke Power Company LLC (subsequently renamed Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas) effective October 1, 2006). As a result of the merger transaction, each outstanding share of Cinergy common stock was converted into 1.56 shares of common stock of Duke Energy, which resulted in the issuance of approximately 313 million shares of Duke Energy common stock. Additionally, each share of common stock of Old Duke Energy was converted into one share of Duke Energy common stock. Old Duke Energy is the predecessor of Duke Energy for purposes of U.S. securities regulations governing financial statement filing. Therefore, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of Old Duke Energy for the three months ended March 31, 2006. New Duke Energy had separate operations for the period beginning with the effective date of the Cinergy merger, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to New Duke Energy. Cinergys results have been included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations from the effective date of acquisition and thereafter (see Cinergy Merger in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses and Sales of Other Assets). Both Old Duke Energy and New Duke Energy are referred to as Duke Energy hereinafter.  

On January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas businesses, named Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra Energy), including its wholly-owned subsidiary Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Energy Capital, formerly Duke Capital LLC). The natural gas businesses spun off primarily consisted of Duke Energys Natural Gas Transmission business segment and Duke Energys 50% ownership interest in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream, formerly Duke Energy Field Services, LLC), which was part of the Field Services business segment. The results of operations of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods prior to the spin-off. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  

During the third quarter of 2005, Duke Energys Board of Directors authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former Duke Energy North Americas (DENA) remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets. The exit plan was completed in the second quarter of 2006. Certain assets of the former DENA business were transferred to the Commercial Power business segment and certain operations that Duke Energy continues to wind-down are in Other. The results of operations of the former DENA businesses which Duke Energy exited have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods prior to the completion of the exit activities.  

Business Segments. At December 31, 2008, Duke Energy operated the following business segments, all of which are considered reportable segments under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,: U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, Commercial Power and International Energy. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, Crescent was a reportable business segment of Duke Energy; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, Crescent is no longer considered an operating segment of Duke Energy as Duke Energys chief operating decision maker no longer reviews Crescents operating results in order to make resource allocation decisions and evaluate its performance. Accordingly, the results of Crescent have been included in Other for all periods presented. Prior to Duke Energys sale of an effective 50% ownership interest in Crescent in September 2006 (see below), the then Crescent segment represented Duke Energys 100% ownership of Crescent Resources, LLC. Duke Energys chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information about each reportable business segment, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments.

PART I  

The following is a brief description of the nature of operations of each of Duke Energys reportable business segments, as well as Other.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity in central and western North Carolina, western South Carolina, southwestern Ohio, central, north central and southern Indiana, and northern Kentucky. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas also transports and sells natural gas in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. It conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas), Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio), Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana) and Duke Energy Kentucky, Inc. (Duke Energy Kentucky). These electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) and the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC). Substantially all of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas operations are regulated and, accordingly, these operations are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, (SFAS No. 71).  

Commercial Power. Commercial Power owns, operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Powers generation asset fleet consists of Duke Energy Ohios non-regulated generation in Ohio, acquired from Cinergy in April 2006, and the five Midwestern gas-fired non-regulated generation assets that were a portion of the former DENA operations. Commercial Powers assets, excluding wind energy generation assets, comprise approximately 7,550 net megawatts (MW) of power generation primarily located in the Midwestern U.S. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. Most of the generation asset output in Ohio has been contracted through the Rate Stabilization Plan (RSP), which expired on December 31, 2008; effective January 1, 2009 Commercial Power began operating under an Electric Security Plan (ESP), which expires on December 31, 2011. As a result of the approval of the ESP, certain of Commercial Powers operations are accounted for under SFAS No. 71 effective December 17, 2008. For more information on the RSP and ESP, as well as the reapplication of SFAS No. 71 to certain of its operations, see the Commercial Power section below. Through Duke Energy Generation Services, Inc. and its affiliates (DEGS), Commercial Power develops, owns and operates electric generation for large energy consumers, municipalities, utilities and industrial facilities. DEGS currently manages 6,300 MW of power generation at 21 facilities throughout the U.S. In addition, DEGS engages in the development, construction and operation of wind energy projects. Currently, DEGS has over 5,000 MW of wind energy projects in the development pipeline with approximately 370 net MW of wind generating capacity in operation as of December 31, 2008. In 2008, DEGS initiated a joint venture with Areva Inc. named ADAGE, LLC, to develop, design, build, and operate wood burning biomass power plants in the U.S.  

International Energy. International Energy owns, operates and manages power generation facilities, and engages in sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas outside the U.S. It conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy International, LLC (DEI) and its activities target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns equity investments in Saudi Arabia and Greece.  

Other. The remainder of Duke Energys operations is presented as Other. While it is not considered a business segment, Other primarily includes certain unallocated corporate costs, Crescent, DukeNet Communications, LLC (DukeNet) and related telecom businesses and Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison), Duke Energys wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. Additionally, Other includes the remaining portion of Duke Energys business formerly known as DENA that was not exited or transferred to Commercial Power, primarily Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC (DETM), which management is currently in the process of winding down. Unallocated corporate costs include certain costs not allocable to Duke Energys reportable business segments, primarily governance costs, costs to achieve mergers and divestitures (such as the Cinergy merger and spin-off of Spectra Energy) and costs associated with certain corporate severance programs. Crescent develops and manages high-quality commercial, residential and multi-family real estate projects primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern U.S. Some of these projects are developed and managed through joint ventures. Crescent also manages legacy land holdings in North and South Carolina. DukeNet develops, owns and operates a fiber optic communications network, primarily in the Carolinas, serving wireless, local and long-distance communications companies, internet service providers and other businesses and organizations. Bisons principal activities as a captive insurance entity include the insurance and reinsurance of various business risks and losses, such as workers compensation, property, business interruption and general liability of subsidiaries and affiliates of Duke Energy. On a limited basis, Bison also participates in reinsurance activities with certain third parties.

U.S. FRANCHISED ELECTRIC AND GAS  

Service Area and Customers  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity and transports and sells natural gas. It conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky (Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky collectively referred to as Duke Energy Midwest). Its service area covers about 48,000 square miles with an estimated population of 11 million in central and western North Carolina, western South Carolina, southwestern Ohio, central, north central and southern Indiana, and northern Kentucky. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas supplies electric service to approximately 4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers over 150,900 miles of distribution lines and a 20,900 mile transmission system. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas provides domestic regulated transmission and distribution services for natural gas to approximately 500,000 customers in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky via approximately 7,200 miles of gas mains (gas distribution lines that serve as a common source of supply for more than one service line) and service lines. Electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities and to public and private utilities. In addition, municipal and cooperative customers who purchased portions of the power generated by the Catawba Nuclear Station may also buy power from a variety of suppliers, including Duke Energy Carolinas, through contractual agreements. For more information on the Catawba Nuclear Station joint ownership, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Ownership of Generating and Transmission Facilities.  

Duke Energy Carolinas service area has a diversified commercial and industrial presence. Manufacturing continues to be the largest contributor to the economy in the region. Other sectors such as finance, insurance, real estate services, and local government also constitute key components of the states gross domestic product. Chemicals, food, electronics and motor vehicle manufacturing industries were the most significant contributors to the areas manufacturing output. In contrast, the majority of Duke Energy Carolinas industrial and commercial electric sales revenue for 2008 came from the textiles industry, which continues to decline, real estate and education services sectors.  

Duke Energy Carolinas has business development strategies to leverage the competitive advantages of its service territory to attract and expand advanced manufacturing and data intensive businesses. These competitive advantages, including a quality workforce, strong educational institutions, superior transportation infrastructure and competitive electric rates approximately 30% below the national average were key factors in attracting new businesses. The success in attracting new companies, as well as expanding the operations of existing customers, partially offset the sales declines in the industries like apparel, textile and furniture in 2008.  

Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Kentuckys service area both have a diversified commercial and industrial presence. Major components of the economy include manufacturing, real estate and rental leasing, wholesale trade, financial and insurance services, retail trade, education, healthcare and professional/business services.  

The primary metals industry, transportation equipment, chemicals, and paper and plastics were the most significant contributors to the areas manufacturing output and Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Kentuckys industrial sales revenue for 2008. Food and beverage manufacturing, fabricated metals, and electronics also have a strong impact on the areas economic growth and the regions industrial sales.  

Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky have business development strategies to leverage the competitive advantages of the Greater Cincinnati Region to attract and expand advanced manufacturing and life sciences sectors. The availability of a highly skilled workforce, superior highway access, low cost of living, and proximity to markets and raw materials are key factors in attracting new customers in the aerospace, transportation, food manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, plastics and Information technology industries.  

Industries of major economic significance in Duke Energy Indianas service territory include food products, stone, clay and glass, primary metals, and transportation. Other significant industries operating in the area include chemicals, fabricated metal, and other manufacturing. Key sectors among general service customers include education and retail trade.  

Duke Energy Indiana has business development strategies to leverage the competitive advantages of the Indiana region to attract new advanced manufacturing, logistics, life sciences and data center business to Duke Energy Indianas service territory. These advantages, including competitive electric rates, a strong transportation network, excellent institutions of higher learning, and a quality workforce, are key in attracting new customers and encouraging existing customer expansions. This ability to attract business investment in the service territory helped balance the decline in sales in the stone, clay and glass, primary metals and other manufacturing and transportation equipment sector in 2008.

PART I  

The number of residential and general service customers within the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service territory continues to increase. As a result, sales to these customers are increasing due to the growth in these sectors, although near-term growth is being hampered by the current economic conditions. As sales to residential and commercial customers are expected to increase over the coming years, the level of sales to industrial customers becomes a smaller, yet still significant, portion of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas sales.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher revenue and cash flows during those periods. By contrast, fewer sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance during those periods. Peak gas sales occur during the winter months.  

The following maps show the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service territories and operating facilities.

PART I  

Energy Capacity and Resources  

Electric energy for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas customers is generated by three nuclear generating stations with a combined net capacity of 5,173 MW (including Duke Energys approximate 19% ownership in the Catawba Nuclear Station), fifteen coal-fired stations with a combined net capacity of 13,472 MW (including Duke Energys 69% ownership in the East Bend Steam Station and 50.05% ownership in Unit 5 of the Gibson Steam Station), thirty-one hydroelectric stations (including two pumped-storage facilities) with a combined net capacity of 3,263 MW, fifteen combustion turbine (CT) stations burning natural gas, oil or other fuels with a combined net capacity of 5,245 MW and one combined cycle (CC) station burning natural gas with a net capacity of 285 MW. Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, summer reliability, growth, and price. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy, and reliability of power supply.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve native-load customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. The vast majority of customer energy needs are met by large, low-energy-production-cost nuclear and coal-fired generating units that operate almost continuously (or at baseload levels). In 2008, approximately 99.0% of the total generated energy came from U.S Franchised Electric and Gas low-cost, efficient nuclear and coal units (66.9% coal and 32.1% nuclear). The remaining energy needs were supplied by hydroelectric, CT and CC generation or economic purchases from the wholesale market.  

Hydroelectric (both conventional and pumped storage) in the Carolinas and gas/oil CT and CC stations in both the Carolinas and Midwest operate primarily during the peak-hour load periods (at peaking levels) when customer loads are rapidly changing. CTs and CCs produce energy at higher production costs than either nuclear or coal, but are less expensive to build and maintain, and can be rapidly started or stopped as needed to meet changing customer loads. Hydroelectric units produce low-cost energy, but their operations are limited by the availability of water flow.

Table of Contents 

PART I  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas major pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities offer the added flexibility of using low-cost off-peak energy to pump water that will be stored for later generation use during times of higher-cost on-peak generation periods. These facilities allow U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to maximize the value spreads between different high- and low-cost generation periods.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is engaged in planning efforts to meet projected load growth in its service territories. Long-term projections indicate a need for significant capacity additions, which may include new nuclear, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), coal facilities or gas-fired generation units. Because of the long lead times required to develop such assets, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is taking steps now to ensure those options are available. Significant current or potential future capital projects are discussed below.  

William States Lee III Nuclear Station. On December 12, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a combined construction and operating license (COL) for two Westinghouse AP1000 (advanced passive) reactors for the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station at a site in Cherokee County, South Carolina. Each reactor is capable of producing approximately 1,117 MW. Submitting the COL application does not commit Duke Energy Carolinas to build nuclear units. On February 25, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas received confirmation from the NRC that its COL application has been accepted and docketed for the next stage of review. On June 27, 2008, the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League (BREDL) filed a petition to intervene in the COL proceeding before the NRC. On September 22, 2008, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board issued a decision denying BREDLs Petition to Intervene and Request for Hearing. BREDL did not appeal the decision. On December 7, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed applications with the NCUC and the PSCSC for approval of Duke Energy Carolinas decision to incur development costs associated with the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station. The NCUC had previously approved Duke Energy Carolinas decision to incur the North Carolina allocable share of up to $125 million in development costs through 2007. The 2007 requests cover a total of up to $230 million in pre-construction development costs through 2009, which is comprised of $70 million incurred through December 31, 2007 plus an additional $160 million of anticipated costs in 2008 and 2009. The PSCSC approved Duke Energy Carolinas Lee Nuclear project development cost application on June 9, 2008, and the NCUC issued its approval order on June 11, 2008. On July 24, 2008, environmental intervenors filed motions to rescind or amend the approval orders issued by the NCUC and the PSCSC, and Duke Energy Carolinas subsequently filed responses in opposition to the motions. On August 13 and August 25, 2008, the PSCSC and NCUC denied the environmental intervenor motions. The NRC review of the COL application is ongoing and the current schedule concludes the COL may be granted in early 2012.  

Cliffside Unit 6. On June 2, 2006, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to construct two 800 MW state of the art coal generation units at its existing Cliffside Steam Station in North Carolina. On March 21, 2007, the NCUC issued an Order allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to build one 800 MW unit. The NCUCs Order explained the basis for its decision to approve construction of one unit, with an approved cost estimate of $1.93 billion (including allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC)), and included certain conditions including providing for updates on construction cost estimates. On February 29, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its updated cost estimate of $1.8 billion (excluding approximately $600 million of AFUDC) for the approved new Cliffside Unit 6. Duke Energy Carolinas believes that the overall cost of Cliffside Unit 6 will be reduced by approximately $125 million in federal advanced clean coal tax credits. On February 20, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into an amended and restated engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services agreement, valued at approximately $1.3 billion, with an affiliate of The Shaw Group, Inc., of which approximately $950 million relates to participation in the construction of Cliffside Unit 6, with the remainder related to a flue gas desulfurization system on an existing unit at Cliffside.  

On January 29, 2008, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) issued a final air permit for the new Cliffside Unit 6 and on-site construction has begun. In March 2008, four contested case petitions were filed appealing the final air permit. Duke Energy has intervened in all four cases, which have been consolidated. A hearing is not expected before the end of 2009.  

Dan River and Buck Steam Stations. On June 29, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC preliminary CPCN information to construct a 620 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility at its existing Dan River Steam Station, as well as updated preliminary CPCN information to construct a 620 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility at its existing Buck Steam Station. On December 14, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed CPCN applications for the two combined cycle facilities. The NCUC consolidated its consideration of the two CPCN applications and held an evidentiary hearing on the applications on March 11, 2008. The NCUC issued its order approving the CPCN applications for the Buck and Dan River combined cycle projects on June 5, 2008. On May 5, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into an engineering, construction and commissioning services agreement for the Buck combined cycle project, valued at approximately $275 million, with Shaw North Carolina, Inc. On November 5, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas notified the NCUC that since the issuance of the CPCN Order, recent economic factors have caused increased uncertainty with regard to forecasted load and near-term capital expenditures, which has resulted in a modification of the construction schedule. Under the revised schedule, the Buck Project is

 expected to be delayed for a period of up to one year and is currently anticipated to begin operation in simple cycle mode in summer 2011 and is expected to convert to combined cycle mode in summer 2012. The Dan River Project is expected to begin operation in combined cycle mode in 2012 as originally planned, but without a phased-in simple cycle commercial operation.  

Edwardsport IGCC. On September 7, 2006, Duke Energy Indiana and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company d/b/a Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana (Vectren) filed a joint petition with the IURC seeking a CPCN for the construction of a 630 MW IGCC power plant at Duke Energy Indianas Edwardsport Generating Station in Knox County, Indiana. The petition describes the applicants need for additional base load generating capacity and requests timely recovery of all construction and operating costs related to the proposed generating station, including financing costs, together with certain incentive ratemaking treatment. In April 2007, Duke Energy Indiana and Vectren filed a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) Study Report which included an updated estimated cost for the IGCC project of approximately $2 billion (including approximately $120 million of AFUDC). In June 2007, Vectren decided not to proceed with the CPCN petition, and in August 2007, Vectren formally withdrew its participation in the IGCC plant. In June 2007, a hearing was conducted on the CPCN petition based on Duke Energy Indiana owning 100% of the project. On November 20, 2007, the IURC issued an order granting Duke Energy Indiana a CPCN for the proposed IGCC project, approved the cost estimate of $1.985 billion and approved the timely recovery of costs related to the project.  

On May 1, 2008, Duke Energy Indiana filed its first semi-annual IGCC Rider and ongoing review proceeding with the IURC as required under the CPCN order issued by the IURC in November 2007, which approved the IGCC Project. In its filing, Duke Energy Indiana requested approval of a new cost estimate for the IGCC Project of $2.35 billion (including approximately $125 million of AFUDC) and for approval of plans to study carbon capture as required by the IURCs November 2007 CPCN Order. An evidentiary hearing was conducted on August 25, 2008. On January 7, 2009, the IURC approved Duke Energy Indianas request, including the new cost estimate of $2.35 billion, and cost recovery associated with a study on carbon capture. On November 3, 2008, Duke Energy Indiana filed its second semi-annual IGCC rider and ongoing review proceeding with the IURC. Duke Energy Indiana was also required to file its plans for studying carbon storage related to the project within 60 days of the order. Under the CPCN order and statutory provisions, Duke Energy Indiana is entitled to recover the costs reasonably incurred in reliance on the CPCN Order. Duke Energy Indiana has begun construction on the Edwardsport IGCC plant and entered into a $200 million engineering, procurement and construction management agreement with Bechtel Power Corporation in December 2008 in connection with the construction of the plant.  

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for further discussion on the above in-process or potential construction projects.  

Fuel Supply  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas relies principally on coal and nuclear fuel for its generation of electric energy. The following table lists U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas sources of power and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Statistics related to coal generation and all fuels reflect U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas 69% ownership interest in the East Bend Steam Station and 50.05% ownership interest in Unit 5 of the Gibson Steam Station.  

 (b) Statistics related to nuclear generation and all fuels reflect U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas 12.5% interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station through September 30, 2008 and an approximate 19% ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station from October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008.  

 (c) Cost statistics include amounts for light-off fuel at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas coal-fired stations.  

 (d) Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.  

 (e) Includes legacy Cinergy regulated operations from the date of acquisition (April 3, 2006) and thereafter.  

Coal. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas meets its coal demand in the Carolinas and Midwest through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply contracts. Expiration dates for its supply contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range from 2009 to 2013. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other   

12  

Table of Contents 

PART I  

 suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. The coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. The coal purchased for the regulated Midwest entities is primarily produced in Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has an adequate supply of coal to fuel its projected 2009 operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected 2010 operations.  

The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas for the Carolinas is approximately 1%; however, as Carolinas coal plants continue to bring on scrubbers over the next several years, the sulfur content of coal purchased could increase as higher sulfur coal options are considered. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas for the Midwest is approximately 2%. Coupled with the use of available sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances on the open market, this satisfies the current emission limitations for SO2 for existing facilities in the Carolinas and Midwest.  

Gas. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to native load customers in its Ohio and Kentucky service territories. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies (natural gas intended to be available at all times) and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season (November through March) and during the non-heating season (April through October) through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This strategy allows U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to assure reliable natural gas supply for its high priority (non-curtailable) firm customers during peak winter conditions and provides U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas suppliers under U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas customer choice/gas transportation programs. In 2008, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately 90% of the natural gas supply, with the remaining gas purchased on the spot market. These firm supply agreements feature two levels of gas supply, specifically (1) baseload, which is a continuous supply to meet normal demand requirements, and (2) swing load, which is gas available on a daily basis to accommodate changes in demand due primarily to changing weather conditions.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas also owns two underground caverns with a total storage capacity of approximately 16 million gallons of liquid propane. In addition, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas has access to 5.5 million gallons of liquid propane storage and product loan through a commercial services agreement with a third party. This liquid propane is used in the three propane/air peak shaving plants located in Ohio and Kentucky. Propane/air peak shaving plants vaporize the propane and mix with natural gas to supplement the natural gas supply during peak demand periods and emergencies.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas manages natural gas procurement-price volatility mitigation programs for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. These programs pre-arrange between 10-25% of total winter heating season gas requirements for Duke Energy Ohio, between 10-35% of total winter heating season gas requirements for Duke Energy Kentucky and between 10-50% of total summer season gas requirements for both Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky for up to three years in advance of the delivery month. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky use primarily fixed-price forward contracts and contracts with a ceiling and floor on the price. As of December 31, 2008, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky, combined, had locked in pricing for approximately 24% of their winter 2008/2009 system load requirements.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to the gas turbine generators to serve native electric load customers in the Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky service territories. The natural gas procurement strategy is to contract with one or several suppliers who buy spot market natural gas supplies along with firm or interruptible interstate pipeline transportation capacity for deliveries to the site. This strategy allows for competitive pricing, flexibility of delivery, and reliable natural gas supplies to each of the natural gas plants. Many of the natural gas plants can be served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines.  

Duke Energy Indiana hedges a percentage of its winter and summer expected native gas burn from Indiana gas turbine units using financial swaps tied to the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas futures.  

Nuclear. The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the services to convert uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the services to enrich the uranium hexafluoride, and the services to fabricate the enriched uranium hexafluoride into usable fuel assemblies.  

Duke Energy Carolinas has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel the Oconee, McGuire and Catawba Nuclear Stations in the Carolinas. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Duke Energy Carolinas staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements at Oconee, McGuire and Catawba in the near-term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of

PART I  

 fuel fabrication services, Duke Energy Carolinas generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multi-year contracts.  

Duke Energy Carolinas has entered into fuel contracts that, based on its current need projections, cover 100% of the uranium concentrates, conversion services, and enrichment services requirements of the Oconee, McGuire and Catawba Nuclear Stations through at least 2011 and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2016. For subsequent years, a portion of the fuel requirements at Oconee, McGuire and Catawba are covered by long-term contracts. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Duke Energy Carolinas believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with uranium spot market purchases.  

In 1999, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a contract with Shaw AREVA MOX Services (MOX Services; formerly Duke COGEMA Stone & Webster, LLC) to purchase mixed-oxide fuel for use in the McGuire and Catawba nuclear reactors. Under this contract, beginning in 2007, MOX Services would fabricate batches of mixed-oxide fuel from stockpiles of plutonium derived from surplus weapons at a facility under construction at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River site in Aiken, South Carolina. Mixed oxide fuel is similar to conventional uranium fuel. Following review and approval by the NRC, four MOX fuel lead assemblies, fabricated in France, were irradiated for two fuel cycles (approximately three years) in Unit 1 of the Catawba Nuclear Station. In 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas and MOX Services engaged in discussions to renegotiate the terms of the contract prior to its expiration on December 1, 2008. The parties were unable to reach agreement and the contract automatically terminated on December 1, 2008. Duke Energy Carolinas has communicated to MOX Services that it continues to support the objectives of the surplus weapons disposition program and is interested in receiving a future proposal from MOX Services for the use of MOX fuel.  

Energy Efficiency. In May 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its Save-A-Watt energy efficiency plan with the NCUC seeking approval to implement new energy efficiency programs, a new regulatory recovery model and a rate rider. The plan recognizes energy efficiency as a reliable, valuable resource that is a fifth fuel, that should be part of the portfolio available to meet customers growing need for electricity along with coal, nuclear, natural gas, or renewable energy. The plan would compensate Duke Energy Carolinas for verified reductions in energy use and be available to all customer groups. The plan contains proposals for several different energy efficiency programs. Customers would pay for energy efficiency programs with an energy efficiency rider that would be included in their power bill and adjusted annually. The proposed energy efficiency rider would be based on 90% of the avoided capacity and energy cost of generation not needed as a result of the success of Duke Energy Carolinas energy efficiency efforts. The plan is consistent with Duke Energy Carolinas public commitment to invest 1% of its annual retail revenues from the sale of electricity in energy efficiency programs subject to the appropriate regulatory treatment of Duke Energy Carolinas energy efficiency investments. Piedmont Natural Gas Company and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. raised certain concerns regarding the incentives offered to Duke Energy Carolinas customers under its proposed portfolio of energy efficiency programs. In June 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas filed settlement agreements resolving all issues with these parties. Duke Energy Carolinas has not reached settlement with any of the other intervenors. The evidentiary hearing occurred the week of July 28, 2008 and concluded on August 18, 2008. Duke Energy Carolinas was unable to reach a settlement with any party to the proceeding. On October 7, 2008 Duke Energy Carolinas filed its proposed order and legal brief with the NCUC. Duke Energy Carolinas is awaiting a decision from the NCUC.  

On February 26, 2009, the NCUC issued an order approving the proposed energy efficiency programs as new programs eligible for incentives under North Carolinas 2009 energy legislation. The NCUC requested additional information regarding the earnings potential under its proposed Save-A-Watt recovery mechanism before ruling on this issue; however, it authorized Duke Energy Carolinas to implement its proposed energy efficiency rider pending final resolution and subject to refund.  

On February 25, 2009, the PSCSC issued a directive rejecting Duke Energy Carolinas Save-A-Watt energy efficiency plan, which was filed with the PSCSC on September 28, 2007.  

On July 11, 2007, the PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohios Demand Side Management/ Energy Efficiency Program (DSM). The DSM programs were first proposed in 2006 and were endorsed by the Duke Energy Community Partnership, which is a collaborative group made up of representatives of organizations interested in energy conservation, efficiency and assistance to low-income customers. The program costs will be recouped through a cost recovery mechanism that will be adjusted annually to reflect the previous years activity. Duke Energy Ohio is permitted to recover lost revenues, program costs and shared savings (once the programs reach 65% of the targeted savings level) through the cost recovery mechanism based upon impact studies to be provided to the Staff of the PUCO. Duke Energy Ohio filed the Save-A-Watt Energy Efficiency Plan as part of its ESP filed with PUCO on July 31, 2008 (see Commercial Power section below). A Stipulation and Recommendation for consideration by the PUCO regarding Duke Energy Ohios ESP filing, including implementation of Save-A-Watt, was filed in October 2008. The ESP hearing occurred on November 10, 2008. On December 17, 2008,

 the PUCO determined that certain non-residential customers may opt out of Duke Energy Ohios energy efficiency initiative. Applications for rehearing of this decision have been filed by environmental groups and a residential customer advocate group. On February 11, 2009 the PUCO issued an Entry denying the rehearing requests.  

In October 2007, Duke Energy Indiana filed its petition with the IURC requesting approval of an alternative regulatory plan to increase its energy efficiency efforts in the state. Similar to the plans in North Carolina and South Carolina, Duke Energy Indiana seeks approval of a plan that will be available to all customer groups and will compensate Duke Energy Indiana for verified reductions in energy usage. Under the plan, customers would pay for energy efficiency programs through an energy efficiency rider that would be included in their power bill and adjusted annually through a proceeding before the IURC. The energy efficiency rider proposal is based on the avoided cost of generation not needed as a result of the success of Duke Energy Indianas energy efficiency programs. A number of parties have intervened in the proceeding. On May 29, 2008, Duke Energy and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. filed a stipulation and settlement agreement in the proceeding. On August 1, 2008, Duke Energy Indiana reached a settlement agreement with the OUCC resolving all issues in the proceeding. The settlement agreement was filed with the IURC on August 15, 2008. On October 31, 2008, Duke Energy Indiana reached a settlement agreement with Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynamics, Inc. and the Kroger Company resolving all issues in the proceeding. The settlement agreement was filed with the IURC on November 3, 2008. On January 15, 2009, Duke Energy Indiana entered into a settlement that amended the October 31, 2008 settlement, adding two additional intervenors to the settlement  the Indiana Industrial Group and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Duke Energy Indiana has not reached a settlement with one intervenor in the proceeding, the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc. An evidentiary hearing with the IURC is scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2009.  

On November 15, 2007, Duke Energy Kentucky filed its annual application to continue existing energy efficiency programs, consisting of nine residential and two commercial and industrial programs, and to true-up its gas and electric tracking mechanism for recovery of lost revenues, program costs and shared savings. On February 11, 2008, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a motion to amend its energy efficiency programs and applied to reinstitute a low income Home Energy Assistance Program. The KPSC bifurcated the proposed Home Energy Assistance Program from the other energy efficiency programs. On May 14, 2008, the KPSC approved the energy efficiency programs. On September 25, 2008, the KPSC approved Duke Energy Kentuckys Home Energy Assistance program, making it available for customers at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. On December 1, 2008, Duke Energy Kentucky filed an application for a Save-A-Watt Energy Efficiency Plan. The application seeks a new energy efficiency recovery mechanism similar to what was proposed in Ohio and Indiana.  

Renewable Energy. Climate change concerns, as well as the oil price volatility, have sparked rising government support in driving increasing renewable energy legislation at both the federal and state level. For example, the new energy legislation passed in North Carolina in 2007 establishes a renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities at 3% of output by 2012, rising gradually to 12.5% by 2021. In 2008, the State of Ohio also passed legislation that included renewable energy and advanced energy targets. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana have issued Request for Proposals seeking bids for power generated from renewable energy sources, including sun, wind, water, organic matter and other sources.  

With the passage of Senate Bill 221 (SB 221) in Ohio in 2008, Duke Energy Ohio is required to include an increasing percentage of renewables as part of its generation portfolio. The percentage, beginning in 2009 with 0.25% non-solar and 0.004% solar, increases to 12.5% non-solar and 0.5% solar by 2024. Of these percentages, 50% of the resources must come from within the state of Ohio. To address this legislation, Duke Energy Ohio initiated a comprehensive renewable Request for Proposals (RFP) in June 2008. Duke Energy Ohio evaluated the bids and selected both solar and non-solar bids to begin negotiations aimed toward final contract executions. Initial objectives are focused on meeting the specific near term 2009 and 2010 requirements. Duke Energy Ohio is also working with regulators to seek clarifications on points of the SB 221 renewable guidelines. Duke Energy Ohio will continue its renewable efforts with bidders, suppliers and the community in Ohio to meet the increasing renewable obligations.  

With the passage of Senate Bill 3 in North Carolina in 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas was required to include an increasing percentage of renewables as part of its generation portfolio. Senate Bill 3 requires solar compliance at 0.02% of retail sales beginning in 2010 and 3% of total portfolio to comply with solar, swine and poultry requirements beginning 2012. Total North Carolina renewable energy resource compliance increases to 12.5% by 2021. To address this legislation, Duke Energy Carolinas initiated a comprehensive renewable RFP in April 2007 to address the 2010 through 2014 renewable portfolio standards requirements. As a result of the 2007 renewable energy RFP, Duke Energy Carolinas has executed a contract with a solar bidder and several landfill gas contracts which will be added to the hydro facilities portfolio to meet future compliance requirements. Duke Energy Carolinas is working with regulators to seek clarifications on points of the Senate Bill 3 renewable guidelines. Duke Energy Carolinas will continue its growing renewable efforts with bidders, suppliers and the community in the Carolinas to meet the increasing renewable obligations.

PART I  

Duke Energy Indiana issued a comprehensive renewable RFP in October 2007. Due to the uncertainty in the financial markets, Duke Energy Indiana has extended its timeline for review of the proposals received from the October 2007 renewable RFP. Duke Energy Indiana will continue its renewable efforts with bidders, suppliers and the community in Indiana to stay involved in developing renewable energy efforts in the state of Indiana.  

Inventory  

Generation of electricity is capital-intensive. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas must maintain an adequate stock of fuel, materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2008, the inventory balance for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas was approximately $914 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information.  

Nuclear Insurance and Decommissioning  

Duke Energy owns and operates the McGuire and Oconee Nuclear Stations and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station. The McGuire and the Catawba Nuclear Stations each have two nuclear reactors and the Oconee Nuclear Station has three. Nuclear insurance includes: liability coverage; property, decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and business interruption and/or extra expense coverage. The other joint owners of the Catawba Nuclear Station reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance premiums. The Price-Anderson Act requires Duke Energy to provide for public liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial projection liability, which is approximately $12.5 billion. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and ContingenciesNuclear Insurance, for more information.  

In 2005, the NCUC and PSCSC approved a $48 million annual amount for contributions and expense levels for decommissioning. In each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Duke Energy expensed approximately $48 million and contributed cash of approximately $48 million to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds (NDTF) for decommissioning costs. The entire amount of these contributions were to the funds reserved for contaminated costs as contributions to the funds reserved for non-contaminated costs have been discontinued since the current estimates indicate existing funds to be sufficient to cover projected future costs. The balance of the external NDTF, was approximately $1,436 million as of December 31, 2008 and $1,929 million as of December 31, 2007.  

Estimated site-specific nuclear decommissioning costs, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, total approximately $2.3 billion in 2003 dollars, based on a decommissioning study completed in 2004. This includes costs related to Duke Energys proportionate ownership in Catawba Nuclear Station at the time, which was 12.5%. The other joint owners of Catawba Nuclear Station are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station. Both the NCUC and the PSCSC have allowed Duke Energy to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of Duke Energys nuclear stations. Duke Energy believes that the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning.  

As the NCUC and the PSCSC require that Duke Energy update its cost estimate for decommissioning its nuclear plants every five years, new site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies were completed in January 2009 that showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs, including the cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, of approximately $3 billion in 2008 dollars. This estimate includes Duke Energys 19.25% ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station. Duke Energy will file these site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies with the NCUC and the PSCSC later this year. In addition to the decommissioning cost studies, a new funding study is underway to determine the appropriateness of the annual amounts currently being contributed to the NDTF. The NCUC and the PSCSC will consider the results of the funding study, which could potentially increase the annual required contributions to the NDTF, in the latter part of 2009.  

After used fuel is removed from a nuclear reactor, it is cooled in a spent-fuel pool at the nuclear station. Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Duke Energy contracted with the DOE for the disposal of used nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin accepting used nuclear fuel on January 31, 1998, the date specified by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and in Duke Energys contract with the DOE. Duke Energy will continue to safely manage its used nuclear fuel until the DOE accepts it. In 1998, Duke Energy filed a claim with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the DOE related to the DOEs failure to accept commercial used nuclear fuel by the required date. Damages claimed in the lawsuit were based upon Duke Energys costs incurred as a result of the DOEs partial material breach of its contract, including the cost of securing additional used fuel storage capacity. On March 5, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reached a settlement resolving Duke Energys used nuclear fuel litigation against the DOE. The agreement provided for an initial payment to Duke Energy of approximately $56 million for certain storage costs incurred through July 31, 2005, with additional amounts reimbursed annually for future storage costs.

Asbestos Related Injuries and Damages Claims  

Duke Energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical reimbursements relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by Duke Energy Carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to 1985.  

Duke Energy has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to Duke Energy Carolinas asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of $476 million. Reserves recorded on Duke Energys Consolidated Balance Sheets are based upon the minimum amount in Duke Energys best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through 2027. Management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against Duke Energy Carolinas after 2027. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2027 related to such potential claims. Asbestos-related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation, if applicable, and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. These reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. A significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed, the nature of the alleged injury, and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change managements estimated liability, as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial. A federal legislative solution, further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability. Given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside Duke Energys control, management believes it is reasonably possible that Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of its recorded reserves.  

Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio have also been named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits related to asbestos at their electric generating stations. The impact on Duke Energys consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position of these cases to date has not been material. Based on estimates under varying assumptions, concerning uncertainties, such as, among others: (i) the number of contractors potentially exposed to asbestos during construction or maintenance of Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio generating plants; (ii) the possible incidence of various illnesses among exposed workers and (iii) the potential settlement costs without federal or other legislation that addresses asbestos tort actions, Duke Energy estimates that the range of reasonably possible exposure in existing and future suits over the foreseeable future is not material. This estimated range of exposure may change as additional settlements occur and claims are made and more case law is established.  

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies-Litigation-Asbestos Related Injuries and Damages Claims, for more information.  

Competition  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas competes in some areas with government-owned power systems, municipally owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and other private utilities. By statute, the NCUC and the PSCSC assign service areas outside municipalities in North Carolina and South Carolina, respectively, to regulated electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives. Substantially all of the territory comprising Duke Energy Carolinas service area has been assigned in this manner. In unassigned areas, Duke Energy Carolinas business remains subject to competition. A decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court limits, in some instances, the right of North Carolina municipalities to serve customers outside their corporate limits. In South Carolina, competition continues between municipalities and other electric suppliers outside the municipalities corporate limits, subject to the regulation of the PSCSC. In Kentucky, the right of municipalities to serve customers outside corporate limits is subject to court approval. In Ohio, certified suppliers may offer retail electric generation service to residential, commercial and industrial customers. In Indiana, the state is divided into certified electric service areas for municipal utilities, rural cooperatives and investor owned utilities. There are limited circumstances where the certified electric service areas can be modified, with approval of the IURC. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas also competes with other utilities and marketers in the wholesale electric business. In addition, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas continues to compete with natural gas providers.  

Regulation  

State  

The NCUC, the PSCSC, the PUCO, the IURC and the KPSC (collectively, the State Utility Commissions) approve rates for retail electric service within their respective states. In addition, the PUCO and the KPSC approve rates for retail gas distribution service within their respective states. The FERC approves U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas cost-based rates for electric sales to certain wholesale customers. The State Utility Commissions, except for the PUCO, also have authority over the construction and operation of U.S. Franchised Elec-

PART I  

 tric and Gas facilities. CPCNs issued by the State Utility Commissions, as applicable, authorize U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas to construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant State Utility Commission is required for Duke Energys regulated operating companies to issue securities.  

Duke Energy Carolinas Rate Case. In June 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC seeking authority to increase its rates and charges for electric service in North Carolina effective January 1, 2008. This application complied with a condition imposed by the NCUC in approving the Cinergy merger. On October 5, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Partial Settlement) among Duke Energy Carolinas, the North Carolina Public Staff, the North Carolina Attorney Generals Office, Carolina Utility Customers Association Inc., Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates III and Wal-Mart Stores East LP, for consideration by the NCUC. The Partial Settlement, which includes Duke Energy Carolinas and all intervening parties to the rate case, reflected agreements on all but a few issues in these matters, including two significant issues. The two significant issues related to the treatment of ongoing merger cost savings resulting from the Cinergy merger and the proposed amortization of Duke Energy Carolinas development costs related to GridSouth Transco, LLC (GridSouth), a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) planned by Duke Energy Carolinas and other utility companies as a result of previous FERC rulemakings, which was suspended in 2002 and discontinued in 2005 as a result of regulatory uncertainty. The Partial Settlement and the remaining disputed issues were presented to the NCUC for a ruling.  

The Partial Settlement reflected an agreed to reduction in net revenues and pre-tax cash flows of approximately $210 million and corresponding rate reductions of 12.7% to the industrial class, 5.05%7.34% to the general class and 3.85% to the residential class of customers with an effective date of January 1, 2008. Under the Partial Settlement, effective January 1, 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas discontinued the amortization of the environmental compliance costs pursuant to North Carolina clean air legislation discussed above and began capitalizing all environmental compliance costs above the cumulative amortization charge of $1.05 billion as of December 31, 2007. Over the past five years, the average annual clean air amortization was $210 million. The Partial Settlement was designed to enable Duke Energy Carolinas to earn a rate of return of 8.57% on a North Carolina retail jurisdictional rate base and an 11% return on the common equity component of the approved capital structure, which consists of 47% debt and 53% common equity. As part of the settlement, Duke Energy Carolinas agreed to alter the then existing bulk power marketing (BPM) profit sharing arrangement that included a provision to share 50% of the North Carolina retail allocation of the profits from certain wholesale sales of bulk power from Duke Energy Carolinas generating units at market based rates. The Partial Settlement provided that Duke Energy Carolinas share 90% of the North Carolina retail allocation of the profits from BPM transactions beginning January 1, 2008.  

The NCUC issued its Order Approving Stipulation and Deciding Non-Settled Issues (Order) on December 20, 2007. The NCUC approved the Partial Settlement in its entirety. The merger savings rider and GridSouth cost matters are discussed in detail below. For the remaining non-settled issues, the NCUC decided in Duke Energy Carolinas favor. With respect to the merger savings rider and GridSouth cost matters, the Order required that Duke Energy Carolinas test period operating costs reflect an annualized level of the merger cost savings actually experienced in the test period in keeping with traditional principles of ratemaking. The NCUC explained that because rates should be designed to recover a reasonable and prudent level of ongoing expenses, Duke Energy Carolinas annual cost of service and revenue requirement should reflect, as closely as possible, Duke Energy Carolinas actual costs. However, the NCUC recognized that its treatment of merger savings would not produce a fair result. Therefore, the NCUC preliminarily concluded that it would reconsider certain language in its 2006 merger order in order to allow it to authorize a 12-month increment rider, beginning January 2008, of approximately $80 million designed to provide a more equitable sharing of the actual merger savings achieved on an ongoing basis. Additionally, the NCUC concluded that approximately $30 million of costs incurred through June 2002 in connection with GridSouth and deferred by Duke Energy Carolinas, were reasonable and prudent and approved a ten-year amortization, retroactive to June 2002. As a result of the retroactive impact of the Order, Duke Energy Carolinas recorded an approximate $17 million charge to write-off a portion of the GridSouth costs in the fourth quarter of 2007. The NCUC did not allow Duke Energy Carolinas a return on the GridSouth investments. As a result of its decision on the non-settled issues, the NCUC ordered an additional reduction in annual revenues of approximately $54 million, offset by its preliminary authorization of a 12-month, $80 million increment rider, as discussed above. The Order ultimately resulted in an overall average rate decrease of 5% in 2008, increasing to 7% upon expiration of this one-time rate rider. On February 18, 2008, the NCUC issued an order confirming their preliminary conclusion regarding the merger savings rider and the $80 million increment rider. Duke Energy Carolinas implemented the rate rider effective January 1, 2008.  

Duke Energy Ohio Electric Rate Filing. Prior to the passage of SB 221 in April 2008, as discussed below, electric generation supply service had been deregulated in Ohio. Accordingly, Duke Energy Ohios electric generation had been deregulated and Duke Energy Ohio was in a competitive retail electric service market in the state of Ohio. Under applicable legislation governing the deregulation of generation, Duke Energy Ohio implemented a RSP, including a market based standard service offer approved by the PUCO. The RSP, among other things, allowed Duke Energy Ohio to recover increased costs associated with environmental expenditures on its deregulated generating fleet, capacity reserves, and provided for a fuel and emission allowance cost recovery mechanism through 2008.

Table of Contents 

PART I  

SB 221 was passed on April 23, 2008 and signed by the Governor of Ohio on May 1, 2008. The new law codifies the PUCOs authority to approve an electric utilitys standard service offer through an ESP, which would allow for pricing structures similar to the current RSP. Electric utilities are required to file an ESP and may also file an application for a market rate option (MRO) at the same time. The MRO is a price determined through a competitive bidding process. If a MRO price is approved, the utility would blend in the RSP or ESP price with the MRO price over a six- to ten-year period, subject to the PUCOs discretion. SB 221 provides for the PUCO to approve non-by-passable charges for new generation, including construction work-in-progress from the outset of construction, as part of an ESP. The new law grants the PUCO discretion to approve single issue rate adjustments to distribution and transmission rates and establishes new alternative energy resources (including renewable energy) portfolio standards, such that the utilitys portfolio must consist of at least 25% of these resources by 2025. SB 221 also provides a separate requirement for energy efficiency, which mandates a reduction of 22% through annual energy savings by 2025. The utilitys earnings under the ESP is subject to an annual earnings test and the PUCO must order a refund if it finds that the utilitys earnings significantly exceed the earnings of benchmark companies with similar business and financial risks. The earnings test acts as a cap to the ESP price. SB 221 also limits the ability of a utility to transfer its designated generating asset to an Exempt Wholesale Generator (EWG) absent PUCO approval. Duke Energy Ohio filed an ESP on July 31, 2008, and a settlement with intervening parties was approved by the PUCO on December 17, 2008.  

For more information on rate matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory MattersU.S. Franchised Electric and Gas.  

Federal  

Regulations of FERC and the State Utility Commissions govern access to regulated electric and gas customer and other data by non-regulated entities, and services provided between regulated and non-regulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of non-regulated affiliates with U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas.  

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into law in August 2005. The legislation directs specified agencies to conduct a significant number of studies on various aspects of the energy industry and to implement other provisions through rule makings. Among the key provisions, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935, directed FERC to establish a self-regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with FERC oversight, extended the Price Anderson Act for 20 years (until 2025), provided loan guarantees, standby support and production tax credits for new nuclear reactors, gave FERC enhanced merger approval authority, provided FERC new backstop authority for the siting of certain electric transmission projects, streamlined the processes for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines, and reformed hydropower relicensing. In 2005 and 2006, FERC initiated several rule makings as directed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. These rulemakings have now been completed, subject to certain appeals and further proceeding. Duke Energy does not believe that these rulemakings or the appeals will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and subsequent rulemakings and events initiated the opening of wholesale energy markets to competition. Open access transmission for wholesale transmission provides energy suppliers and load serving entities, including U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and wholesale customers located in the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service area, with opportunities to purchase, sell and deliver capacity and energy at market-based prices, which can lower overall costs to retail customers.  

Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana are transmission owners in a regional transmission organization operated by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO), a non-profit organization which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members. In 2005, the Midwest ISO began administering an energy market within its footprint.  

On December 17, 2001 the IURC approved the transfer of functional control of the operation of the Duke Energy Indiana transmission system to the Midwest ISO, an RTO established in 1998. On June 1, 2005, the IURC authorized Duke Energy Indiana to transfer control area operations tasks and responsibilities and transfer dispatch and Day 2 energy markets tasks and responsibilities to the Midwest ISO. On August 13, 2008, the IURC authorized Duke Energy Indiana to transfer additional balancing authority functions to the Midwest ISO to permit Duke Energy Indiana to participate in the Midwest ISOs ancillary services market.  

The Midwest ISO is the provider of transmission service requested on the transmission facilities under its tariff. It is responsible for the reliable operation of those transmission facilities and the regional planning of new transmission facilities. The Midwest ISO administers energy markets utilizing Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e., the energy price for the next MW may vary throughout the Midwest ISO market based on transmission congestion and energy losses) as the methodology for relieving congestion on the transmission facilities under its functional control.

PART I  

On December 19, 2005, the FERC approved a plan filed by Duke Energy Carolinas to establish an Independent Entity (IE) to serve as a coordinator of certain transmission functions and an Independent Monitor (IM) to monitor the transparency and fairness of the operation of Duke Energy Carolinas transmission system. Duke Energy Carolinas remains the owner and operator of the transmission system, with responsibility for the provision of transmission service under Duke Energy Carolinas Open Access Transmission Tariff. Duke Energy Carolinas retained the Midwest ISO to act as the IE and Potomac Economics, Ltd. to act as the IM. The IE and IM began operations on November 1, 2006. Duke Energy Carolinas is not currently seeking adjustments to its transmission rates to reflect the incremental cost of the proposal, which is not projected to have a material adverse effect on Duke Energys future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

Other  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. In 2000, the NRC renewed the operating license for Duke Energys three Oconee nuclear units through 2033 for Units 1 and 2 and through 2034 for Unit 3. In 2003, the NRC renewed the operating licenses for all units at Duke Energys McGuire and Catawba stations. The two McGuire units are licensed through 2041 and 2043, respectively, while the two Catawba units are licensed through 2043. All but one of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC under Part I of the Federal Power Act, with license terms expiring from 2005 to 2036. The FERC has authority to issue new hydroelectric generating licenses. Hydroelectric facilities whose licenses expired in 2005 are operating under annual extensions of the current license until FERC issues a new license. Other hydroelectric facilities whose licenses expire between 2009 and 2016 are in various stages of relicensing. Duke Energy expects to receive new licenses for all hydroelectric facilities with the exception of the Dillsboro Project, for which Duke Energy has filed an application to surrender the license. Duke Energy expects to remove this projects dam and powerhouse, as part of the multi-stakeholder licensing agreement.  

U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state and local environmental agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters in this section.)  

COMMERCIAL POWER  

Commercial Power owns, operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Powers generation asset fleet consists of Duke Energy Ohios non-regulated generation in Ohio, acquired from Cinergy in April 2006 and the five Midwestern gas-fired non-regulated generation assets that were a portion of former DENA. Commercial Powers assets, excluding wind energy generation assets, are comprised of approximately 7,550 net MW of power generation primarily located in the Midwestern United States. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. Most of the generation asset output in Ohio has been contracted through the RSP, which expired on December 31, 2008. Effective January 1, 2009, Commercial Power began operating under an ESP, which expires on December 31, 2011, and is described below.

PART I  

Through DEGS, Commercial Power is an on-site energy solutions and utility services provider. Primarily through joint ventures, DEGS engages in utility systems construction, operation and maintenance of utility facilities, as well as cogeneration. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of two or more forms of usable energy from a single source. In support of a strategy to increase its renewable energy portfolio, DEGS acquired the wind power development assets of Energy Investor Funds from Tierra Energy in May 2007 and, in September 2008, acquired Catamount Energy Corporation (Catamount) from Diamond Castle Partners. DEGS currently has approximately 370 net MW of wind energy in operation and over 5,000 MW of wind energy projects in the development pipeline.  

The following map show the location of DEGS wind energy generation assets.  

In October 2006, Duke Energy completed the sale of Commercial Powers energy marketing and trading activities, which were acquired in the Cinergy merger. In December 2006, Duke Energy completed the sale of Caledonia Power 1, LLC, which is the project company that operated and managed the Caledonia peaking generation facility in Mississippi. Additionally, Duke Energy completed the sale of Commercial Powers Brownsville, Tennessee peaking generation facility in April 2008.  

Competition  

Commercial Power primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, coal, natural gas and emission allowances. The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the energy marketing business. Commercial Powers main competitors include other non-regulated generators in the Midwestern U.S. wholesale power, coal and natural gas marketers, renewable energy companies and financial institutions and hedge funds engaged in energy commodity marketing and trading.  

Rates and Regulation. Duke Energy Ohio has been charging the RSP to non-residential customers since January 1, 2005 and to residential customers since January 1, 2006. The RSP charge has been updated in conjunction with the ESP, which is effective January 1, 2009, and consists of the following discrete charges:  

       Annually Adjusted Component (AAC) Rider- This rider is intended to provide cost recovery primarily for environmental compliance expenditures. This component is avoidable (or by-passable) by all customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

       Fuel and Purchased Power (FPP) Rider  This rider is intended to provide cost recovery for fuel, purchased power and emission allowance expenses (including carbon or energy taxes) incurred to generate or procure electricity for retail ratepayers that are

 provided service by Duke Energy Ohio. This component is avoidable (or by-passable) by all customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

       Capacity Dedication Rider  This rider is intended to provide cost recovery for maintaining the generation fleet to serve the retail rate payers. This component is not avoidable (or non-by-passable) by customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

       System Reliability Tracker  This tracker is intended to provide actual cost recovery for capacity purchases made to maintain adequate reserve margin. This component is not avoidable (or non-by-passable) by all customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

       Base Generation Charge  This component reflects a market price for retail generation service and is not a cost-based rate. This component is avoidable (or by-passable) by all customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

       Transmission Cost Recovery Rider  The generation portion of this rider is designed to permit Duke Energy Ohio to recover certain Midwest ISO charges and all FERC approved transmission costs allocable to retail ratepayers that are provided service by Duke Energy Ohio. This component is avoidable (or by-passable) by all customers that switch to an alternative electric service provider.  

Commercial Powers generation operations in the Midwest include generation assets located in Ohio that are dedicated to serve Ohio native load customers. These assets, as excess capacity allows, also generate revenues through sales outside the native load customer base, and such revenue is termed non-native.  

Prior to December 17, 2008, Commercial Power did not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71 to any of its operations due to the comprehensive electric deregulation legislation passed by the state of Ohio in 1999. As described further below, effective December 17, 2008, the PUCO approved Commercial Powers ESP, which resulted in the reapplication of SFAS No. 71 to certain portions of Commercial Powers operations as of that date.  

From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008, Commercial Power had been operating under a RSP, which is a market-based standard service offer. Although the RSP contained certain trackers that enhanced the potential for cost recovery, there was no assurance of stranded cost recovery upon the expiration of the RSP on December 31, 2008 since it was initially anticipated that, upon the expiration of the RSP, there would be a move to full competitive markets. Accordingly, Commercial Power did not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71 to any of its generation operations prior to December 17, 2008. As discussed further in Item 1  Business -U.S. Franchised Electric and GasRegulation, in April 2008, SB 221 was passed in Ohio and signed by the Governor of Ohio on May 1, 2008. The new law codified the PUCOs authority to approve an electric utilitys standard service offer either through an ESP or a MRO. The MRO is a price determined through a competitive bidding process. On July 31, 2008, Duke Energy Ohio filed an ESP, and with certain amendments, the ESP was approved by the PUCO on December 17, 2008. The ESP became effective on January 1, 2009.  

In connection with the approval of the ESP, Duke Energy Ohio reassessed the applicability of SFAS No. 71 to Commercial Powers generation operations as SB 221 substantially increased the PUCOs oversight authority over generation in the state of Ohio, including giving the PUCO complete approval of generation rates and the establishment of an earnings test to determine if a utility has earned significantly excessive earnings. Duke Energy Ohio determined that certain costs and related rates (riders) of Commercial Powers operations related to generation serving native load meet the criteria established by SFAS No. 71 for regulatory accounting treatment as SB 221 and Duke Energy Ohios approved ESP solidified the automatic recovery of certain costs of its generation serving native load and increased the likelihood that these operations will remain under a cost recovery model for certain costs for the foreseeable future.  

Under the ESP, Commercial Power will bill for its native load generation via numerous riders. SB 221 and the ESP resulted in the approval of the automatic recovery of certain of these riders, which includes, but is not limited to, a FPP rider and certain portions of a cost of an ACC rider. Accordingly, Commercial Power began applying SFAS No. 71 to the corresponding RSP riders granting automatic recovery under the ESP on December 17, 2008. The remaining portions of Commercial Powers Ohio native load generation operations, revenues from which are reflected in rate riders for which the ESP does not specifically allow automatic cost recovery, as well as all generation operations associated with non-native customers, including Commercial Powers Midwest gas-fired generation assets, continue to not apply regulatory accounting as those operations do not meet the criteria of SFAS No. 71. Moreover, generation remains a competitive market in Ohio and native load customers continue to have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service. As customers switch, there is a risk that some or all of the regulatory assets will not be recovered through the established riders. Duke Energy Ohio will continue to monitor the amount of native load customers that have switched to alternative suppliers when assessing the recoverability of its regulatory assets established for its native load generation operations.

Table of Contents 

Despite certain portions of the Ohio native load operations not being subject to the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 71, all of Commercial Powers Ohio native load operations rates are subject to approval by the PUCO, and thus these operations are referred to as Commercial Powers regulated operations.  

Commercial Power is subject to regulation at the state level, primarily from PUCO and at the federal level, primarily from FERC. The PUCO approves prices for all retail electric generation sales by Duke Energy Ohio for its native retail service territory. See Regulation section within U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas for additional information regarding deregulation in Ohio.  

Regulations of FERC and the PUCO govern access to regulated electric customer and other data by non-regulated entities, and services provided between regulated and non-regulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of Commercial Power.  

Other ongoing regulatory initiatives at both state and federal levels addressing market design, such as the development of capacity markets and real-time electricity markets, impact financial results from Commercial Powers marketing and generation activities.  

Commercial Power is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters in this section.)  

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY  

International Energy operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas outside the U.S. It conducts operations primarily through DEI and its activities target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns equity investments in: National Methanol Company (NMC), located in Saudi Arabia, which is a regional producer of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and Attiki Gas Supply S.A. (Attiki), located in Athens, Greece, which is a natural gas distributor and was acquired in connection with the Cinergy merger.  

International Energys customers include retail distributors, electric utilities, independent power producers, marketers and industrial/commercial companies. International Energys current strategy is focused on optimizing the value of its current Latin American portfolio and expanding the portfolio through investment in generation opportunities in Latin America.  

International Energy owns, operates or has substantial interests in approximately 4,000 net MW of generation facilities.

PART I  

The following map shows the locations of International Energys facilities, including its interest in non-electric generation facilities in Saudi Arabia and Greece.  

Competition and Regulation  

International Energys sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas competes directly with other generators and marketers serving its market areas. Competitors are country and region-specific but include government-owned electric generating companies, local distribution companies with self-generation capability and other privately-owned electric generating companies. The principal elements of competition are price and availability, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.  

A high percentage of International Energys portfolio consists of baseload hydroelectric generation facilities which compete with other forms of electric generation available to International Energys customers and end-users, including natural gas and fuel oils. Economic activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, weather and other factors affect the supply and demand for electricity in the regions served by International Energy.  

International Energys operations are subject to both country-specific and international laws and regulations. (See Environmental Matters in this section.)  

See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of certain of the risks associated with the operations of International Energy.  

OTHER  

The remainder of Duke Energys operations is presented as Other. While it is not considered a business segment, Other primarily includes certain unallocated corporate costs, Duke Energys approximate 50% ownership interest in Crescent, DukeNet and related telecom businesses and Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison), Duke Energys wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. Additionally, Other includes the remaining portion of Duke Energys business formerly known as DENA that was not exited or transferred to Commercial Power, primarily DETM, which management is currently in the process of winding down. Unallocated corporate costs include certain costs not allocable to Duke Energys reportable business segments, primarily governance costs, costs to achieve mergers and divestitures (such as the Cinergy merger and spin-off of Spectra Energy) and costs associated with certain corporate severance programs.

Table of Contents 

PART I  

 Crescent develops and manages high-quality commercial, residential and multi-family real estate projects, and manages land holdings, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern U.S. DukeNet develops, owns and operates a fiber optic communications network, primarily in the Carolinas, serving wireless, local and long-distance communications companies, internet service providers and other businesses and organizations.  

On September 7, 2006, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Duke Energy closed an agreement to create the Crescent JV with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund V U.S., L.P. (MSREF) and other affiliated funds controlled by Morgan Stanley (collectively the MS Members). Under the agreement, the Duke Energy subsidiary contributed all of the membership interests in Crescent to a newly-formed joint venture, which was ascribed an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2005. In conjunction with the formation of the Crescent JV, the joint venture, Crescent and Crescents subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with third party lenders under which Crescent borrowed approximately $1.21 billion, net of transaction costs, of which approximately $1.19 billion was immediately distributed to Duke Energy. Immediately following the debt transaction, the MS Members collectively acquired a 49% membership interest in the Crescent JV from Duke Energy for a purchase price of approximately $415 million. A 2% interest in the Crescent JV was also issued by the joint venture to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Crescent, which is subject to forfeiture if the executive voluntarily leaves the employment of the Crescent JV within a three year period. Additionally, this 2% interest can be put back to the Crescent JV after three years, or possibly earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, at an amount equal to 2% of the fair value of the Crescent JVs equity as of the put date. Therefore, the Crescent JV will accrue the obligation related to the put as a liability over the three year forfeiture period. Accordingly, Duke Energy has an effective 50% ownership in the equity of Crescent JV for financial reporting purposes. Duke Energys investment in the Crescent JV has been accounted for as an equity method investment for periods after September 7, 2006. During 2008, Crescent recorded impairment charges on certain of its property holdings, of which Duke Energy recorded its proportionate share of $238 million. As a result of Duke Energy recording its proportionate share of Crescents impairment losses, the carrying value of Duke Energys investment in Crescent has been reduced to zero at December 31, 2008. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB 18), Duke Energy suspended applying the equity method of accounting to its investment in Crescent since its investment has been reduced to zero. Accordingly, Duke Energy will not record additional losses related to its investment in Crescent. However, should Crescent begin reporting net income in future periods, Duke Energy may resume applying the equity method of accounting after its proportionate share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. Duke Energy continues to exercise significant influence over the operations and financial policies of Crescent.  

Bisons principal activities as a captive insurance entity include the insurance and reinsurance of various business risks and losses, such as workers compensation, property, business interruption and general liability of subsidiaries and affiliates of Duke Energy. On a limited basis, Bison also participates in reinsurance activities with certain third parties.
