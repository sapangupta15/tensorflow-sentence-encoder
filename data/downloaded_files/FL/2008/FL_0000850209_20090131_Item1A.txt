Item 1A. Risk Factors 

 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans found in Item 1. Business and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please also see Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results may differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report, including those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance. 

We reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to improve our internal controls, our financial results may not be accurately reported. 

 Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009 identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting designed to ensure proper accounting for income taxes, as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. This material weakness, or difficulties encountered in implementing new or improved controls or remediation, could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results, result in material misstatements in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively affect our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information. 

The industry in which we operate is dependent upon fashion trends, customer preferences and other fashion-related factors. 

 The athletic footwear and apparel industry is subject to changing fashion trends and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee that our merchandise selection will accurately reflect customer preferences when it is offered for sale or that we will be able to identify and respond quickly to fashion changes, particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of our merchandise from vendors. For example, we order the bulk of our athletic footwear four to six months prior to delivery to our stores. If we fail to anticipate accurately either the market for the merchandise in our stores or our customers purchasing habits, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow moving inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

 A substantial portion of our highest margin sales are to young males (ages 1225), many of whom we believe purchase athletic footwear and licensed apparel as a fashion statement and are frequent purchasers of athletic footwear. Any shift in fashion trends that would make athletic footwear or licensed apparel less attractive to these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. 

 The retail athletic footwear and apparel business is highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry. Our athletic footwear and apparel operations compete primarily with athletic footwear specialty stores, sporting goods stores and superstores, department stores, discount stores, traditional shoe stores, and mass merchandisers, many of which are units of national or regional chains that have significant financial and marketing resources. The principal competitive factors in our markets are price, quality, selection of merchandise, reputation, store location, advertising, and customer service. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

 Although we sell merchandise via the Internet, a significant shift in customer buying patterns to purchasing athletic footwear, athletic apparel, and sporting goods via the Internet could have a material adverse effect on our business results. In addition, some of our vendors distribute products directly through the Internet and others may follow. Some vendors operate retail stores and some have indicated that further retail stores will open. Should this continue to occur, and if our customers decide to purchase directly from our vendors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

2 

We depend on mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations. 

 Our sales, particularly in the United States and Canada, are dependent in part on a high volume of mall traffic. Our stores are located primarily in enclosed regional and neighborhood malls. Mall traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns, the closing of anchor department stores or changes in customer preferences or acts of terrorism. A decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on us. 

 To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations such as in regional and neighborhood malls anchored by major department stores. We cannot be certain that desirable mall locations will continue to be available. 

The effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war and retail industry conditions may adversely affect our business. 

 Natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, and tornados may affect store and distribution center operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from vendors for sale to our customers. Any significant declines in general economic conditions, public safety concerns or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products. 

A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health. 

 Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to purchase brand-name merchandise at competitive prices, including the receipt of volume discounts, cooperative advertising, and markdown allowances from our vendors. The Company purchased approximately 80 percent of its merchandise in 2008 from its top five vendors and expects to continue to obtain a significant percentage of its athletic product from these vendors in future periods. Approximately 64 percent was purchased from one vendor  Nike, Inc. (Nike). Each of our operating divisions is highly dependent on Nike; they individually purchase 44 to 78 percent of their merchandise from Nike. Our inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers (particularly Nike) as a result of business decisions by our suppliers or any disruption in the supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of our strong dependence on Nike, any adverse development in Nikes financial condition and results of operations or the inability of Nike to develop and manufacture products that appeal to our target customers could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to acquire merchandise at competitive prices or on competitive terms in the future. 

 Merchandise that is high profile and in high demand is allocated by our vendors based upon their internal criteria. Although we have generally been able to purchase sufficient quantities of this merchandise in the past, we cannot be certain that our vendors will continue to allocate sufficient amounts of such merchandise to us in the future. In addition, our vendors provide support to us through cooperative advertising allowances and promotional events. We cannot be certain that such assistance from our vendors will continue in the future. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may experience fluctuations in and cyclicality of our comparable-store sales results. 

 Our comparable-store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable-store sales results, including, among others, fashion trends, the highly competitive retail store sales environment, economic conditions, timing of promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, calendar shifts of holiday periods, and weather conditions. 

 Many of our products, particularly high-end athletic footwear and licensed apparel, represent discretionary purchases. Accordingly, customer demand for these products could decline in a recession or if our customers develop other priorities for their discretionary spending. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our operations may be adversely affected by economic or political conditions in other countries. 

 Approximately 28 percent of our sales and a significant portion of our operating results for 2008 were attributable to our sales in Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. As a result, our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, such as foreign governmental regulations, foreign customer preferences, political unrest, disruptions or delays in shipments, and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we operate. Although we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our operations may be adversely affected by significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar as it relates to certain foreign currencies. 

 In addition, because we and our suppliers have a substantial amount of our products manufactured in foreign countries, our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on favorable terms may be affected by governmental regulations, trade restrictions, and economic, labor, and other conditions in the countries from which our suppliers obtain their product. 

 Our business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary athletic footwear, apparel, and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and customers are hesitant to use available credit. 

The effect of deteriorating global economic conditions and financial markets may adversely affect our business. 

 The Companys performance is subject to global economic conditions and the related impact on consumer spending levels, which have declined recently due to the current economic slowdown. Some of the factors affecting consumer spending are employment, levels of consumer debt, reductions in net worth as a result of recent severe market declines, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, as well as other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including merchandise we sell, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. The downturn in the global economy may continue to affect customer purchases for the foreseeable future and may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, declines in our profitability could result in a charge to earnings for the impairment of goodwill, which would not affect our cash flow but could decrease our earnings, and our stock price could be adversely affected. 

 The recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in security prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. Although we currently do not have any borrowings under our revolving credit facility (other than amounts used for standby letters of credits), tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of the Companys securities. In addition, the current credit situation is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world, and the impact of this situation on our major suppliers cannot be predicted. The Company relies on a few key vendors for a majority of its merchandise purchases (including a significant portion from one key vendor). The inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise. Our inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If our long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges. 

 We review our long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets when events indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. We determine fair value based on a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market-based approach. If an impairment trigger is identified, the carrying value is compared to its estimated fair value and provisions for impairment are recorded as appropriate. Impairment losses are significantly affected by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value. Our estimates of future operating cash flows are identified from our three-year plans, which are based upon our experience, knowledge and expectations; however, these estimates can be affected by such factors as our future operating results, future store profitability, and future economic conditions, all of which can be difficult to predict.

 Similar to others in our industry, the recent macroeconomic conditions have affected both our performance, as well as our stock price and market capitalization, and it is difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will continue, whether they will continue to deteriorate, and which aspects of our business may be adversely affected. These conditions and the continuation of these conditions could affect the fair value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and could result in future impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 

Material changes in the market value of the securities we hold may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

 As of January 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $408 million, of which $380 million was invested in a diversified portfolio of short-term securities. Substantially all of our investments were short-term deposits in highly rated banking institutions. We regularly monitor our counterparty credit risk and mitigate our exposure by making short-term investments only in highly-rated institutions and by limiting the amount we invest in any one institution. At January 31, 2009, most of the investments were in institutions rated AA- or better from a major credit rating agency. Despite those ratings, it is possible that the value or liquidity of our investments may decline due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and bank-specific credit issues. We have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. With the current uncertain financial environment and the instability of financial institutions, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits. 

 The master trust which holds the assets of our U.S. pension plan has assets totaling approximately $346 million as of January 31, 2009. The fair values of these assets held in the master trust are compared to the plans projected benefit obligation to determine the pension funding liability. We attempt to mitigate risk through diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk on our portfolio through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and credit issues. Such declines could have an impact on the funded status of our pension plans and future funding requirements. In addition, the decline in our pension assets will adversely affect pension expense in 2009. 

Complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business. 

 We operate four distribution centers worldwide to support our athletic business. In addition to the distribution centers that we operate, we have third-party arrangements to support our operations in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. If complications arise with any facility or any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, the Companys other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands. This may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. We depend upon UPS for shipment of a significant amount of merchandise. An interruption in service by UPS for any reason could cause temporary disruptions in our business, a loss of sales and profits, and other material adverse effects. 

 Our freight cost is affected by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Increases in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of sales. 

A major failure of our information systems could harm our business. 

 We depend on information systems to process transactions, manage inventory, operate our websites, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, and maintain cost-efficient operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information to be lost or delayed, which could have a negative effect on our business. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. We cannot be assured that our systems will be adequate to support future growth. 

Risks associated with Internet operations. 

 Our Internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, telecommunications failures and similar disruptions. Also, we may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow our online commerce. 

5 

 Business risks related to online commerce include risks associated with the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, Internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, government regulation and legal uncertainties with respect to the Internet, and collection of sales or other taxes by one or more states or foreign jurisdictions. If any of these risks materializes, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. 

Risk associated with our recent acquisition. 

 During the fourth quarter of 2008, we acquired CCS, a leading direct-to-customer retailer that sells skateboard equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories though catalogs and the Internet. We have substantially completed the integration of CCS during the fourth quarter 2008, including moving all personnel and distribution activities to our corporate office and distribution center, respectively. The acquisition of CCS involves a number of risks, which could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including:  failure of CCS to achieve the results that we expect;

  diversion of managements attention from operational matters;

  difficulties integrating the operations and personnel; and

  potential difficulties associated with the retention of key personnel. 

Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information, whether through a breach of the Companys computer system or otherwise, could severely harm our business. 

 As part of the Companys normal course of business, it collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer information. Despite the security measures the Company has in place, its facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human error, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by the Company could severely damage its reputation, expose it to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt its operations and harm its business. 

Our reliance on key management, store and field associates. 

 Future performance will depend upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our executive and senior management team, as well as, store personnel and field management. Our success depends to a significant extent both upon the continued services of our current executive and senior management team, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain additional qualified management in the future. Competition for key executives in the retail industry is intense, and our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain qualified associates. Many of the store and field associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain quality associates, our ability to meet our growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised. In addition, a large number of our retail employees are paid the prevailing minimum wage, which if increased would negatively affect our profitability.
