Business Overview  

As a global business, AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2011, the Company established records for net sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The impact of contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2011 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2011 were:  

       In 2011, net sales were $3.0 billion, an increase of $518.9 million or 21.0% from 2010, on internal growth of approximately 16% in the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 6% in the Electromechanical Group (EMG) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, and contributions from the 2010 and 2011 acquisitions.  

       Net income for 2011 was $384.5 million, an increase of $100.6 million or 35.4% when compared with $283.9 million in 2010.  

       During 2011, the Company completed the following acquisitions:  

       In April 2011, the Company acquired Avicenna Technology, Inc. (Avicenna), a supplier of custom, fine-featured components used in the medical device industry.  

       In May 2011, the Company acquired Coining Holding Company (Coining), a leading supplier of custom-shaped metal preforms, microstampings and bonding wire solutions for interconnect applications in microelectronics packaging and assembly.  

       In October 2011, the Company acquired Reichert Technologies, a manufacturer of analytical instruments and diagnostic devices for the eye care market.  

       In October 2011, the Company acquired EM Test (Switzerland) GmbH, a manufacturer of advanced monitoring, testing, calibrating and display instruments in the electrical immunity testing and emissions measurement markets.  

       In December 2011, the Company acquired Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), a world leader in high-performance vibration isolation systems and optical test benches used to isolate highly sensitive instruments for the microelectronics, life sciences, photonics and ultra-precision manufacturing industries.

       Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by operating activities that totaled $508.6 million for 2011, a $85.6 million or 20.2% increase from 2010.  

       The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were $1,501.1 million or 50.2% of net sales in 2011, compared with $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of net sales in 2010.  

       New orders for 2011 were $3,072.5 million, an increase of $421.2 million or 15.9% when compared with $2,651.3 million in 2010. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2011 was a year end record at $911.4 million.  

       The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $137.6 million in 2011 before customer reimbursement of $6.1 million. Sales from products introduced in the last three years were $595.2 million or 19.9% of net sales.  

       In September 2011, AMETEK completed a new five-year revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $700 million, which excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The new revolving credit facility replaced a $450 million total borrowing capacity revolving credit facility, which excluded a $100 million accordion feature, that was due to expire in June 2012. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $742.7 million available under its revolving credit facility, including the $200 million accordion feature.  

       In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued a 55 million Swiss franc ($59.0 million) 2.44% senior note due December 2021.

Results of Operations  

In 2011, the Company established records for sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions completed in 2011 and the acquisitions of Technical Services for Electronics (TSE) in June 2010, Haydon Enterprises in July 2010 and Atlas Material Testing Technology LLC (Atlas) in November 2010. The full year impact of the 2011 acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities should have a positive impact on our 2012 results.  

Net sales for 2011 were $2,989.9 million, an increase of $518.9 million or 21.0% when compared with net sales of $2,471.0 million in 2010. Net sales for EIG were $1,647.2 million in 2011, an increase of 24.4% from net sales of $1,324.1 million in 2010. Net sales for EMG were $1,342.7 million in 2011, an increase of 17.1% from net sales of $1,146.8 million in 2010. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2011 was driven by strong internal sales growth of approximately 11%, which excludes a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

Total international sales for 2011 were $1,501.1 million or 50.2% of net sales, an increase of $289.8 million or 23.9% when compared with international sales of $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of net sales in 2010. The $289.8 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, driven by continued strong expansion into Asia, as well as growth in Europe, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $774.9 million in 2011, an increase of $210.4 million or 37.3% compared with $564.5 million in 2010. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.  

New orders for 2011 were $3,072.5 million, an increase of $421.2 million or 15.9% when compared with $2,651.3 million in 2010. For 2011, internal order growth was approximately 8%, excluding a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by the differentiated businesses of both EIG and EMG, with the acquisitions mentioned above accounting for the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2011 was a year end record at $911.4 million, an increase of $82.6 million or 10.0% when compared with $828.8 million at December 31, 2010.  

Segment operating income for 2011 was $682.9 million, an increase of $156.3 million or 29.7% when compared with segment operating income of $526.6 million in 2010. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 22.8% in 2011 from 21.3% in 2010. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the leveraged impact of the Companys net sales increase noted above, as well as the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2011 were $349.3 million, an increase of $52.8 million or 17.8% when compared with $296.5 million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.7% for 2011, compared with 12.0% in 2010. A portion of the increase in SG&A expenses was the result of a $2.1 million charge recorded in corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2009 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2011. Selling expense increased $49.4 million or 19.5% for 2011 driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 10.1% for 2011, compared with 10.3% for 2010. Base business selling expense increased approximately 11.6% for 2011, which was in line with internal sales growth.  

Corporate administrative expenses for 2011 were $46.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 8.1% when compared with $43.1 million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.6%  

24  

Table of Contents 

 for 2011, compared with 1.7% in 2010. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily the result of equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second quarter of 2011, noted above, as well as higher compensation related expenses.  

Consolidated operating income was $635.9 million or 21.3% of net sales for 2011, an increase of $153.7 million or 31.9% when compared with $482.2 million or 19.5% of net sales in 2010.  

Interest expense was $69.7 million for 2011, an increase of $2.2 million or 3.3% when compared with $67.5 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the issuance of an 80 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010, partially offset by the repayment of a 50 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010.  

Other expenses, net were $9.6 million for 2011, an increase of $1.2 million when compared with $8.4 million in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by higher acquisition-related expenses and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency.  

The effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.9% compared with 30.1% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 included the impact of the accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock amortization. The effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 included the impact of international statutory tax rate reductions and benefits obtained from a favorable mix of international taxable earnings. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

Net income for 2011 was $384.5 million, an increase of $100.6 million or 35.4% when compared with $283.9 million in 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 were $2.37, an increase of $0.61 or 34.7% when compared with $1.76 per diluted share in 2010.  

Segment Results  

EIGs net sales totaled $1,647.2 million for 2011, an increase of $323.1 million or 24.4% when compared with $1,324.1 million in 2010. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 16%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, and was driven primarily by increases in EIGs process, power and industrial businesses. The acquisitions of EM Test, Reichert Technologies and Atlas accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase.  

EIGs operating income was $420.2 million for 2011, an increase of $104.0 million or 32.9% when compared with $316.2 million in 2010. EIGs operating margins were 25.5% of net sales for 2011 compared with 23.9% of net sales in 2010. The increase in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Groups increase in net sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

EMGs net sales totaled $1,342.7 million for 2011, an increase of $195.9 million or 17.1% when compared with $1,146.8 million in 2010. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 6%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, and was driven by increases in EMGs differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of Coining, Avicenna, Haydon Enterprises and TSE accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase.  

EMGs operating income was $262.7 million for 2011, an increase of $52.3 million or 24.9% when compared with $210.4 million in 2010. EMGs operating margins were 19.6% of net sales for 2011 compared with 18.3% of net sales in 2010. EMGs increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the leveraged impact of the Groups increase in net sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.

Results of Operations  

In 2010, the Company posted strong sales and established records for operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions of TSE, Haydon Enterprises and Atlas in 2010 and the acquisitions of High Standard Aviation in January 2009 and Ameron Global in December 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company began to experience increased order rates which continued through 2010.  

Net sales for 2010 were $2,471.0 million, an increase of $372.6 million or 17.8% when compared with net sales of $2,098.4 million in 2009. Net sales for EIG were $1,324.1 million in 2010, an increase of 15.5% from net sales of $1,146.6 million in 2009. Net sales for EMG were $1,146.8 million in 2010, an increase of 20.5% from net sales of $951.8 million in 2009. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2010 was driven by strong internal sales growth of approximately 13%, with no impact from foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

Total international sales for 2010 were $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of net sales, an increase of $179.6 million or 17.4% when compared with international sales of $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of net sales in 2009. The $179.6 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, as well as continued expansion into Asia, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $564.5 million in 2010, an increase of $150.4 million or 36.3% compared with $414.1 million in 2009. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.  

New orders for 2010 were $2,651.3 million, an increase of $623.2 million or 30.7% when compared with $2,028.1 million in 2009. Throughout most of 2009, the Company experienced lower order rates primarily as a result of the global economic recession, which began in late 2008 and continued through most of 2009. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2010, internal order growth was approximately 23%, excluding a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by both the Companys differentiated and cost-driven businesses, with the acquisitions mentioned above accounting for the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2010 was $828.8 million, an increase of $180.4 million or 27.8% when compared with $648.4 million at December 31, 2009.  

Segment operating income for 2010 was $526.6 million, an increase of $127.1 million or 31.8% when compared with segment operating income of $399.5 million in 2009. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 21.3% in 2010 from 19.0% in 2009. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the leveraged impact of the Companys net sales increase noted above, as well as the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

SG&A expenses for 2010 were $296.5 million, an increase of $42.4 million or 16.7% when compared with $254.1 million in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 12.0% for 2010, compared with 12.1% in 2009. Selling expense increased $32.4 million or 14.7% for 2010, which was in line with internal sales growth. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 10.3% for 2010, compared with 10.5% for 2009. Additionally, the Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expense increased approximately 11.1% for 2010.

Table of Contents 

Corporate administrative expenses for 2010 were $43.1 million, an increase of $9.9 million or 29.8% when compared with $33.2 million in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.7% for 2010, compared with 1.6% in 2009. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher compensation related expenses, as well as other costs necessary to grow the business.  

Consolidated operating income was $482.2 million or 19.5% of net sales for 2010, an increase of $116.1 million or 31.7% when compared with $366.1 million or 17.4% of net sales in 2009.  

Interest expense was $67.5 million for 2010, a decrease of $1.3 million or 1.9% when compared with $68.8 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the repayment of a 40 million British pound borrowing under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of 2009 and a 50 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010, partially offset by the issuance of an 80 million British pound senior note in the third quarter of 2010.  

Other expenses, net were $8.4 million for 2010, an increase of $5.7 million when compared with $2.7 million in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition related expenses.  

The effective tax rate for 2010 was 30.1% compared with 30.2% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 primarily reflects the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and the benefits obtained from international and state income tax planning initiatives.

EIGs operating income was $316.2 million for 2010, an increase of $83.3 million or 35.8% when compared with $232.9 million in 2009. EIGs operating margins were 23.9% of net sales for 2010 compared with 20.3% of net sales in 2009. The increase in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Groups increase in net sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

EMGs net sales totaled $1,146.8 million for 2010, an increase of $195.0 million or 20.5% when compared with $951.8 million in 2009. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 12%, with no impact from foreign currency translation.

Interest rates on outstanding loans under either the current or replaced revolving credit facility are at the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a negotiated spread, or at the U.S. prime rate. The new revolving credit facility replaced a $450 million total borrowing capacity revolving credit facility, which excluded a $100 million accordion feature, that was due to expire in June 2012. The new revolving credit facility provides the Company with additional financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

 (2)  Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007 and the $350 million private placement completed in 2008.  

 (3)  Although not contractually obligated, the Company expects to have the capability to repay the revolving credit loan within one year as permitted in the credit agreement. Accordingly, $134.2 million was classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2011.  

 (4)  Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca SAS acquisition. The lease has a term of 12 years, which began in July 2006, and is payable quarterly.  

 (5)  The leases expire over a range of years from 2012 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.  

 (6)  Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.  

Other Commitments  

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $26.8 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2011. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.

Critical Accounting Policies  

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.5 million, $18.3 million and $16.0 million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $13.2 million, $10.6 million and $8.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.  

       Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $7.8 million and $6.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

       Inventories. The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 74% of its inventories at December 31, 2011. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 26% of its inventory at December 31, 2011. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $25.1 million and $23.9 million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

       Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.  

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 66% to 443% for each of the Companys reporting units.  

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.  

The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $2,114.0 million or 48.9% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.  

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets  

31  

Table of Contents 

 with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.  

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2011, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2011 pension cost was 5.6% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.71% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2011 and determining the 2012 defined benefit pension cost was 5.0% for U.S. plans and 5.22% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2011 of 8.0% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.96% for foreign plans. The Company will use 8.0% for the U.S. plans in 2012 and 6.96% for the foreign plans in 2012. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2011 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2012. The foreign plans rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.97% in 2012. In 2011, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $7.4 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension income of $3.2 million recognized for these plans in 2010. The Company estimates its 2012 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax expense to be approximately $0.7 million.  

All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.  

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 which totaled $5.4 million, compared with $3.6 million in 2010. The Company anticipates making approximately $3 million to $6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.  

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning  

32  

Table of Contents 

 strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures related to fair value measurements, providing greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted the applicable provisions within ASU 2010-06 effective January 1, 2010. The Company adopted the level 3 disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-06 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a significant impact on the Companys fair value disclosures.  

In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition  Milestone Method (ASU 2010-17). ASU 2010-17 establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research or development arrangements. In addition, it requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. ASU 2010-17 was effective on January 1, 2011 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (ASU 2010-29). ASU 2010-29 addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU 2010-29 requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the current and any comparable periods reported. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-29 effective January 1, 2011. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has evaluated ASU 2011-04 and does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Table of Contents 

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05). ASU 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2011-05 that is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and does not expect its adoption to impact the Companys consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation.  

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011-08). The amendments in ASU 2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other. ASU 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting ASU 2011-08 and intends to adopt ASU 2011-08 for the year ending December 31, 2012.  

Internal Reinvestment  

Capital Expenditures  

Capital expenditures were $50.8 million or 1.7% of net sales in 2011, compared with $39.2 million or 1.6% of net sales in 2010. 55% of the expenditures in 2011 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2011 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2012 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 1.8% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.  

Development and Engineering  

The Company is committed to research, development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $137.6 million, $112.1 million and $101.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $6.1 million, $6.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $78.0 million, $56.8 million and $50.5 million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.  

Environmental Matters  

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2011, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company  

34  

Table of Contents 

 is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $28.0 million and $31.3 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2011, the Company recorded $1.2 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $4.5 million on environmental matters in 2011. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 include reserves of $17.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $14.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.  

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.  

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.  

Market Risk  

The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.  

The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

35  

Table of Contents 

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Chinese renminbi, the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

Forward-Looking Information  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
