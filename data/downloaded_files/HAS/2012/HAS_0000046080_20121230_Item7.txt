EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro or the Company) is a branded play company dedicated to fulfilling the fundamental need for play for children and families through creative expression of the Companys world class brand portfolio. From toys and games, to television programming, motion pictures, digital gaming and a comprehensive licensing program, Hasbro applies its brand blueprint to its broad portfolio of properties. The brand blueprint revolves around the objectives of continuously re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting the Companys existing brands, imagining, inventing and igniting new brands, and offering consumers the ability to experience the Companys brands in all areas of their lives.  

To accomplish these objectives, the Company offers consumers the ability to experience its branded play through innovative toys and games, digital media, lifestyle licensing and publishing and entertainment, including television programming and motion pictures. The Companys focus remains on growing owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products and brands which respond to market insights, offering entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the Companys brands across multiple forms and formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to increase operating margins and maintain a strong balance sheet.  

The Company earns revenue and generates cash primarily through the sale of a broad variety of toy and game products and distribution of television programming based on the Companys properties, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with complementary products, including digital media and games and lifestyle products, offered by third parties. The Companys brand architecture includes franchise brands, challenger brands, gaming mega brands, key licensed brands and new brands. The Companys franchise and challenger brands represent Company-owned brands or brands which if not entirely owned, are broadly controlled by the Company, and which have been successful over the long term. Franchise brands are the Companys most significant owned or controlled brands which have the ability to deliver significant revenue over the long-term. Challenger brands are brands which have not achieved franchise brand status yet, but have the potential to do so with investment and time. These franchise and challenger brands include TRANSFORMERS, NERF, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS, BABY ALIVE, G.I. JOE, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH and PLAYSKOOL. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new forms and formats over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with an owned or controlled brand. By focusing on these brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2012 the Company had strong revenues from owned or controlled brands such as NERF, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TRANSFORMERS, PLAY-DOH, FURREAL FRIENDS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL, MONOPOLY and MY LITTLE PONY.  

The Companys innovative product offerings encompass a broad variety of toys including boys action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls toys, electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive products, creative play and toy-related specialty products. Games offerings include boys action, board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games.  

While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its owned or controlled brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to

 opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths and allow the Company to offer innovative products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties. The Companys primary licenses include its agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (Marvel) for characters in the Marvel universe, including SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS; Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (Lucas), related to the STAR WARS brand; and Sesame Workshop, related to the SESAME STREET characters. Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company. Sales of MARVEL products are dependent upon the number and quality of theatrical releases in any given year. In 2012, the Company had significant sales of MARVEL products, particularly from sales of products related to the movie releases of MARVELS THE AVENGERS and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. In 2011, the Company had sales of MARVEL products, including sales of products related to the Marvel movie releases of THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER. In 2010, the Company had significant sales of products related to the Marvel movie release of IRON MAN 2. During 2013 the Company will market products related to three expected theatrical motion picture releases based on MARVEL properties, IRON MAN 3, THE WOLVERINE and THOR: THE DARK WORLD. The Company re-introduced BEYBLADE products, another licensed entertainment property, during the second half of 2010 and had significant sales in both 2011 and 2012. In addition to offering products based on licensed entertainment properties, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors.  

The Company also seeks to build all-encompassing brand experiences and drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its brands through entertainment such as motion pictures and television programming. Since 2007, the Company has had a number of motion pictures based on its brands released by major motion picture studios including three motion pictures based on its TRANSFORMERS brand, one motion picture based on its G.I. JOE brand and one motion picture based on its mega gaming brand, BATTLESHIP. The Company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. The next motion picture based on the Companys properties is G.I. JOE: RETALIATION which is scheduled to be released in March of 2013 by Paramount Pictures. The Company has motion picture projects based on other brands in development for potential release in future years.  

In addition to using motion pictures to provide entertainment experiences for its brands, the Company has an internal wholly-owned production studio, Hasbro Studios, which is responsible for the creation and development of television programming based primarily on Hasbros brands. This programming is currently aired throughout the world. The Company is a 50% partner in a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. (Discovery) which runs THE HUB, a cable television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming. Programming on THE HUB includes content based on Hasbros brands, Discoverys library of childrens educational programming, as well as programming developed by third parties. Hasbro Studios programming is distributed in the U.S. to THE HUB, other leading childrens networks internationally and on various digital platforms, such as Netflix and iTunes. The Companys television initiatives support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format.  

The Companys strategic blueprint and brand architecture also focus on extending its brands further into digital media and gaming, including through the licensing of the Companys properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands. An example of these digital gaming relationships is the Companys agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), which provides EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject to existing limitations on the Companys rights and certain other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as mobile devices, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on a number of the Companys intellectual properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, and BOGGLE. Similarly, the Company has an agreement with Activision under which Activision offers digital games based on the TRANSFORMERS brand, as well as with other third party digital gaming companies such as DeNA and GameLoft. The Company continues to seek and develop additional outlets for its brands in digital gaming, including casual, mobile and online gaming.  

The Company also seeks to express its brands through its lifestyle licensing business. Under its lifestyle licensing programs, the Company enters into relationships with a broad spectrum of apparel, food, bedding and  

27  

Table of Contents 

 other lifestyle products companies for the global marketing and distribution of licensed products based on the Companys brands. These relationships further broaden and amplify the consumers ability to experience the Companys brands.  

As the Company seeks to grow its business in entertainment, licensing and digital gaming, the Company will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms and formats.  

During 2011, the Company established Hasbros Gaming Center of Excellence in Rhode Island to centralize games marketing and development while building on Hasbros strategy of re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting core brands as well as inventing new brands.  

During the first quarter of 2012 the Company took certain measures to strengthen its organization and right size certain businesses and functions, resulting in employee termination and recognition of severance costs of approximately $11,100.  

During the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company announced a plan in which it expects to generate annual cost savings of $100,000 by 2015. This plan includes an approximate 10% workforce reduction, facility consolidations and process improvements which reduce redundancy and increase efficiencies. Other cost savings initiatives include focus on fewer, larger global brands and a reduction in the number of SKUs. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $36,100 related to this plan. The Company expects to incur additional charges through 2013 as additional components of the plan are implemented.  

The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the second half of the year accounted for 64%, 63% and 65% of the Companys net revenues, respectively.  

The Company sells its products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. In recent years, the Companys international net revenues have experienced growth as the Company has sought to increase its international presence. One of the ways the Company has driven international growth is by opening offices in certain markets to develop a greater presence. Since 2006, the Company has opened up operations in new markets around the world including China, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Czech Republic, Peru and Colombia. These represent emerging markets where the Company believes that it can achieve higher revenue growth than it could achieve in more mature markets. Net revenues in emerging markets increased by 16% in 2012 compared to 2011 and represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in 2012. Net revenues of the Companys International segment represented 44%, 43% and 39% of total net revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

The Companys business is separated into three principal business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the United States and Canada. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South American toy and game marketing and sales operations. The Companys Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Companys lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and online entertainment operations. In addition to these three primary segments, the Companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment.  

The Company is committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this initiative, from 2005 through 2011, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) adopted six successive share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $2,825,000. The sixth authorization was approved in May 2011 for $500,000. At December 30, 2012, the Company had $127,282 remaining available under this authorization. During the three years ended 2012, the Company spent a total of $1,159,730, to repurchase 28,918 shares in the open market. The Company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions, the Companys other potential uses of cash and the Companys levels of cash generation. In addition to the share repurchase program, the Company also seeks to return excess cash through the payment of quarterly dividends. In February

 2013 the Companys Board increased the Companys quarterly dividend rate, effective for the dividend payment in May 2013, to $0.40 per share, an 11% increase from the prior year quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share. This was the ninth dividend increase in the previous 10 years. During that period, the Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.03 to $0.40 per share.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Results of Operations  

The fiscal year ended December 30, 2012 was a fifty-three week period while each of the fiscal years in the two-year period ended December 25, 2011 were fifty-two week periods.  

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2012 were $335,999, or $2.55 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2011 and 2010 of $385,367, or $2.82 per diluted share and $397,752, or $2.74 per diluted share, respectively.  

Net earnings for 2012 includes a $0.26 per diluted share unfavorable impact resulting from restructuring costs associated with the cost savings initiatives announced during the first and fourth quarters of 2012. Net earnings for 2011 includes a $0.07 per diluted share unfavorable impact resulting from costs associated with the reorganization of the Companys games business announced during the second quarter of 2011 related to the establishment of the Gaming Center of Excellence. Substantially all of the restructuring charges in 2012 and 2011 are included in Corporate and Eliminations in the Companys segment reporting.

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2012 were $4,088,983 compared to $4,285,589 in 2011 and $4,002,161 in 2010. Most of the Companys net revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 2011 were impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $(98,500) and $64,300, respectively. The following table presents net revenues by product category for the years ended December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the year ended December 30, 2012, decreased net revenues in the boys and preschool categories were partially offset by increases in the girls and games categories. For the year ended December 25, 2011, decreased net revenues in the girls and games categories were more than offset by increases in the boys and preschool categories.  

BOYS: Net revenues in the boys category decreased 13% in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of lower net revenues from TRANSFORMERS and BEYBLADE products, which were partially offset by higher sales of MARVEL products, primarily due to sales of products based on the theatrical releases of MARVELS THE AVENGERS in May 2012 and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN in July 2012. In 2011, net revenues in the boys category grew 35% compared to 2010, primarily due to higher net revenues from TRANSFORMERS, BEYBLADE and KRE-O products. In 2011, TRANSFORMERS net revenues were positively impacted by the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON in June 2011. Also, 2011 marked the first full year of sales of BEYBLADE products, which were re-introduced during the second half of 2010, and the introduction of KRE-O products during the second half of 2011.  

GAMES: Net revenues in the games category increased 2% in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, BATTLESHIP and TWISTER, as well as the introduction of boys action gaming products, which included STAR WARS FIGHTER PODS, ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS and TRANSFORMERS BOT SHOTS. These higher revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands, including SCRABBLE, CONNECT 4 and YAHTZEE. In 2011, net revenues in the games category decreased 10% compared to 2010 as a result of lower net revenues from board games partially offset by increased net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING products.  

GIRLS: Net revenues in the girls category increased 7% in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to new initiatives including the introduction of FURBY and ONE DIRECTION products. Higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products, which are supported by television programming, also contributed to growth in the girls category. These higher net revenues were partially offset by decreased net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, FURREAL FRIENDS and STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products. In 2011, net revenues in the girls category decreased 11% compared to 2010 primarily due to lower net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP products partially offset by increased net revenues from BABY ALIVE and MY LITTLE PONY products.  

PRESCHOOL: Net revenues in the preschool category decreased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011. Increased net revenues from PLAY-DOH and PLAYSKOOL HEROES products, which includes MARVEL products, STAR WARS products and TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS, were more than offset by declines in SESAME STREET and TONKA products. In 2011, the preschool category benefited from the introduction of new products under the Companys license with Sesame Workshop as well as PLAYSKOOL HEROES products which contributed to overall growth of 4% compared to 2010. These increases were partially offset by decreased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL, TONKA and PLAY-DOH products.

The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for 2012, 2011 and 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

U.S. and Canada  

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2012 decreased 6% in 2012 compared to 2011 while net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 decreased 2% in 2011 compared to 2010. The impact of currency translation was not material in either period. In 2012, lower net revenues from boys and preschool products partially offset by higher net revenues from girls and games products contributed to the segments decline while lower net revenues from girls and games products partially offset by higher net revenues from boys and preschool products contributed to the segments decline in 2011 compared to 2010. The Companys expectation in 2012 was that a higher portion of U.S. and Canada segment net revenues would shift to the second half of the year as part of a strategy to more closely align shipments with consumer demand. However, the challenging retail environment in the United States during the holiday season resulted in the segment not realizing the level of shipments in the later part of the fourth quarter that had been anticipated which contributed to the overall 6% decline in net revenues in the segment.  

In 2012, higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY and EASY BAKE products as well as the introduction of FURBY and ONE DIRECTION products contributed to growth in the girls category. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenues from FURREAL FRIENDS, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, LITTLEST PET SHOP and BABY ALIVE products in 2012. In 2011, moderately higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY and BABY ALIVE products compared to 2010 were more than offset by lower net revenues from FURREAL FRIENDS and LITTLEST PET SHOP products.  

In the games category, higher net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TWISTER, BATTLESHIP and boys action gaming products, primarily STAR WARS and TRANSFORMERS products, in 2012 were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands. Similarly, in 2011, higher net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING products compared to 2010 were more than offset by lower net revenues from board games.  

In the boys category, higher sales of MARVEL products, particularly movie-related products related to THE AVENGERS and SPIDER-MAN, in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by lower net revenues from TRANSFORMERS, STAR WARS, BEYBLADE and NERF products. In 2011, higher net revenues from TRANSFORMERS, particularly movie-related products, compared to 2010 as well as higher sales of BEYBLADE products and the introduction of KRE-O products were partially offset by lower net revenues from NERF and to a lesser extent STAR WARS and TONKA products.  

Increased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL HEROES, primarily MARVEL-related, and to a lesser extent higher net revenues from PLAY-DOH products were more than offset by decreased sales of SESAME STREET and TONKA products. In 2011, higher net revenues from SESAME STREET, TRANSFORMERS and STAR WARS products compared to 2010 were partially offset by lower net revenues from PLAYSKOOL, TONKA and PLAY-DOH products.

U.S. and Canada operating profit increased 15% in 2012 compared to 2011 and decreased 20% in 2011 compared to 2010. Operating profit margin improved to 15.1% in 2012 compared to 12.4% in 2011. The increase in operating profit and margin was primarily the result of product mix as well as improved inventory management, which resulted in lower inventory obsolescence costs in 2012 compared to 2011. Changes in product mix included less impact from closeout sales in 2012 compared to 2011. U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased by 20% in 2011 compared to 2010. The operating profit margin in 2011 decreased to 12.4% of net revenues compared to 15.2% in 2010. The decline in operating profit and margin in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of the decline in net revenues in 2011; product mix, including lower revenues from games and higher revenues from entertainment-based products; and the impact of closeout sales. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on U.S. and Canada operating profit in 2012 or 2011.  

International  

International segment net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2012 decreased 4% compared to 2011 while net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 increased 19% compared to 2010. In 2012, net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $98,000 as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar whereas net revenues in 2011 were positively impacted by currency translation of $59,300 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net revenues for 2012 and 2011 increased 1% and 16%, respectively, compared to prior years.  

The following table presents net revenues by geographic region for the Companys International segment for 2012, 2011 and 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2012, a negative impact from currency translation of $79,100 and $20,000 for Europe and Latin America, respectively, in addition to challenging economic environments in certain developed economies contributed to the overall decline in net revenues for the segment. Currency translation did not have a material impact on net revenues for the Asia Pacific region. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, net revenues in Latin America increased 14% and net revenues in Europe decreased 2% in 2012 compared to 2011. Net revenues in emerging international markets, including Brazil, Russia and Colombia, increased 16% in 2012 compared to 2011. Net revenues increased in 2011 in all major geographic regions as part of our ongoing strategy to achieve growth in the International segment.  

By product category, the decrease in net revenues in 2012 was predominantly the result of lower net revenues from boys products and marginally lower net revenues from games and girls products while net revenues from preschool products were flat for the year. In 2011, higher net revenues from boys products compared to 2010 were partially offset by lower net revenues from games, girls and preschool products.  

In the boys category, higher net revenues from MARVEL, particularly movie-related products related to THE AVENGERS and SPIDER-MAN, KRE-O and STAR WARS products in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by lower net revenues from BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS products. In 2011, higher net revenues from BEYBLADE, TRANSFORMERS, particularly movie-related products, and NERF products compared to 2010 as well as higher net revenues from BEYBLADE, KRE-O and SUPER SOAKER products contributed to the categorys growth in the International segment.

Table of Contents 

In the games category, higher net revenues from boys action gaming products, primarily STAR WARS and TRANSFORMERS related, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TWISTER and BATTLESHIP products in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by decreased net revenues from other game brands. In 2011, net revenues in the games category decreased compared to 2010 as a result of lower net revenues from board games, partially offset by increased net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING products.  

Higher net revenues from MY LITTLE PONY and the introduction of FURBY products in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by lower net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products. FURBY products were introduced into English-speaking markets in 2012 and will be introduced to certain non-English speaking markets in 2013. In 2011, the decrease in net revenues in the girls toys category was primarily due to decreased net revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP products, which were partially offset by increased net revenues from FURREAL FRIENDS and BABY ALIVE products.  

Net revenues in the preschool category were flat for 2012. Increased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL HEROES products, primarily MARVEL-related, and PLAY-DOH products were wholly offset by decreased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL and SESAME STREET products. In 2011, decreased net revenues from PLAYSKOOL and TONKA products in the preschool category were partially offset by sales of SESAME STREET products which were introduced in 2011.  

International segment operating profit decreased 20% in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 29% in 2011 compared to 2010. Operating profit margin decreased to 12.1% of net revenues in 2012 from 14.5% of net revenues in 2011 and increased in 2011 from 13.4% of net revenues in 2010. Operating profit for the International segment in 2012 and 2011 was impacted by approximately $(11,900) and $4,400, respectively, due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. In 2012, decreases in operating profit and operating profit margin were primarily due to lower net revenues discussed above in addition to higher selling, distribution and administration expenses. Higher cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues was partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result of the mix of entertainment-based and non-entertainment based product sales. Further, the decline in operating profit margin in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the change in geographical mix of net revenues, with a higher percentage coming from emerging markets, which currently have lower operating profit margins than the Company has in developed markets. In 2011, the increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the increased net revenues described above. This was partially offset by higher royalty expense as a result of increased revenues from higher royalty-bearing products, particularly BEYBLADE and movie-related TRANSFORMERS products. The increase in operating profit margin was largely due to the impact of the increased net revenues.  

Entertainment and Licensing  

Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 12% in 2012 compared to 2011 and 19% in 2011 compared to 2010. Increases for each year were primarily due to the sale and distribution of television programming which included global television distribution, digital distribution and home entertainment. Increased net revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 were partially offset by decreased net revenues from lifestyle licensing primarily relating to lower TRANSFORMERS movie-related licensing revenues whereas lifestyle licensing revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010, related to TRANSFORMERS movie-related licensing revenues.  

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased 24% in 2012 compared to 2011 and decreased 1% in 2011 compared to 2010. In 2012, higher net revenues from television programming distribution directly contributed to a higher operating profit. In 2011, the impact of higher net revenues was offset by investments made by the Company to grow its global licensing organization as well as increased program production cost amortization reflecting the fact that 2011 was the first full year of television programming distribution.

Expenses  

The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 30, 2012:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating expenses in 2012 and 2011 each includes costs resulting from restructuring activities. In 2011, the Company incurred costs of $14,385 associated with establishing Hasbros Gaming Center of Excellence. In 2012, the Company incurred costs associated with events occurring during the first and fourth quarters. During the first quarter of 2012 the Company incurred employee severance charges of $11,130 associated with measures to right size certain businesses and functions. During the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company announced a cost savings initiative to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately $100,000 by 2015. This initiative includes a workforce reduction, facility consolidations and process improvements. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recognized charges totaling $36,045, primarily related to employee severance charges. The Company expects additional charges in 2013 and beyond as it implements additional phases of this program.  

These expenses were recorded to the consolidated statements of operations as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. Cost of sales decreased to 40.9% of net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2012 from 42.8% in 2011. Cost of sales in 2012 includes approximately $2,800 related to the reorganization of certain business units. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues in 2012 was positively impacted by product mix, which included higher MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues, which typically have lower costs of sales as a percentage of net revenues. Further, the impact of closeout sales improved in 2012 compared to 2011. In addition, cost of sales was positively impacted by lower inventory obsolescence costs in 2012 compared to 2011. Cost of sales increased to 42.8% of net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2011 from 42.2% in 2010. The negative impacts of lower sales of traditional board games as well as increased close-out inventory shipments in 2011 were only partially offset by the positive impact of increased net revenues from entertainment-based properties, such as TRANSFORMERS and BEYBLADE products, and net revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING products. In addition, cost of sales was negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances as a result of reduced games production in 2011. While cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues of entertainment-based products are generally lower than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products, including Company owned or controlled brands based on a movie release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the benefit of these lower cost of sales.  

Royalty expense totaled $302,066, or 7.4% of net revenues, in 2012 compared to $339,217, or 7.9% of net revenues, in 2011 and $248,570, or 6.2% of net revenues, in 2010. Fluctuations in royalty expense are generally

 related to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given year, especially if there is a major motion picture release. Higher royalty expense in 2011 compared to 2012 and 2010 primarily reflects the higher sales of certain entertainment-driven products in 2011, primarily BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS products, compared to 2012 and 2010. In 2012, sales of MARVEL products, particularly those related to MARVELS THE AVENGERS and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, partially offset the reduction in sales of BEYBLADE and movie-related TRANSFORMERS products from the prior year.  

Product development expense in 2012 totaled $201,197, or 4.9% of net revenues, compared to $197,638, or 4.6% of net revenues, in 2011 and $201,358, or 5.0% of net revenues, in 2010. Product development expense for 2012 and 2011 includes restructuring charges of approximately $11,000 and $6,700, respectively. Excluding the impact of these charges, product development expense remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 and the lower expense for each year compared to 2010 reflects the Companys continued focus on leveraging its development efforts on larger, global brands.  

Advertising expense in 2012 increased to $422,239, or 10.3% of net revenues, compared to $413,951, or 9.7% of net revenues, in 2011 and $420,651, or 10.5% of net revenues, in 2010. Increased advertising in 2012 compared to 2011 in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenue is, in part, due to the Companys strategy to increase its spend in consumer-facing marketing and advertising. Lower advertising expense in 2011 compared to 2012 and 2010 reflects the increased volume in sales of entertainment-based properties, primarily TRANSFORMERS and BEYBLADE products in 2011, which do not require the same level of advertising that the Company spends on non-entertainment based products.  

Amortization of intangibles increased to $50,569, or 1.3% of net revenues, compared to $46,647, or 1.1% of net revenues, in 2011 and $50,405, or 1.3% of net revenues, in 2010. Increased amortization in 2012 compared to 2011 was the result of higher expense related to certain intangibles that are amortized based on actual and projected net revenues. The decrease in 2011 is the result of certain properties becoming fully amortized during 2010.  

Program production cost amortization increased to $41,800, or 1.0% of net revenues, compared to $35,798, or 0.8% of net revenues, in 2011 and $22,069, or 0.6% of net revenues, in 2010. Program production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. The Company did not begin amortizing program production costs until the third quarter of 2010, upon the initial distribution of its television programming. The increase in 2012 reflects a higher number of television programs being produced and distributed as well as higher net revenues. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects four quarters of activity whereas the comparable period of 2010 includes only two quarters of activity.  

Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $847,347, or 20.7% of net revenues, compared to $822,094, or 19.2% of net revenues, in 2011 and $781,192, or 19.5% of net revenues, in 2010. Selling, distribution and administration expense for 2012 and 2011 includes approximately $33,500 and $7,600, respectively, of restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, selling, distribution and administration expense decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of lower shipping and warehousing costs related to lower revenues and lower inventory balances. Increased stock compensation and bonus provisions in 2012 compared to 2011 were substantially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. In 2011, increased shipping costs related to higher revenues as well as increased expenses from the Companys investments in emerging markets, on-line operations, licensing, entertainment and its internal systems contributed to higher selling, distribution and administration costs compared to 2010. These increases were partially offset by lower stock compensation and bonus provisions in 2011 due to the Companys underperformance in relation to its financial targets.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense increased to $91,141 in 2012 from $89,022 in 2011 and $82,112 in 2010. Increased interest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflects higher average short-term borrowings as well as the impact of the extra week of interest expense on long-term debt in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2010. In March 2010, the Company issued $500,000 of long-term debt which bears interest at a rate of 6.35%. The impact on interest expense of this issuance was partially offset by the conversion and redemption of the contingent convertible debentures during March and April 2010, which bore interest at a rate of 2.75%.

Interest Income  

Interest income was $6,333 in 2012 compared to $6,834 in 2011 and $5,649 in 2010. Interest income in 2011 includes approximately $1,100 in interest received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to prior years. Absent the impact of this receipt, interest income in 2012 increased compared to 2011 reflecting higher invested cash balances, primarily in international markets.  

Other (Income) Expense, Net  

Other (income) expense, net of $13,575 compares to $25,400 in 2011 and $3,676 in 2010. The decrease in other (income) expense, net in 2012 is primarily due to lower net losses on foreign currency transactions as well as investments gains in 2012 compared to investment losses in 2011. In 2011, the increase in other (income) expense, net is primarily due to losses on foreign currency transactions and investment losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010.  

Foreign currency exchange net losses of $4,178 in 2012 compared to $8,343 in 2011 and foreign currency exchange net gains of $(725) in 2010. The net loss in 2011 includes $3,700 related to derivative instruments which no longer qualified for hedge accounting. Investment gains of $(1,257) in 2012 compared to losses of $4,617 in 2011 and gains of $(3,822) in 2010. The losses in 2011 primarily reflect the decrease in value of warrants to purchase common stock of an unrelated company. Other (income) expense, net in 2012, 2011 and 2010 includes $6,015, $7,290 and $9,323 respectively, relating to the Companys 50% share in the loss of THE HUB.  

Income Taxes  

Income tax expense totaled 25.9% of pretax earnings in 2012 compared with 20.8% in 2011 and 21.7% in 2010. Income tax expense for 2012 includes net benefits of approximately $8,300 from discrete events related to the repatriation of certain highly taxed foreign earnings and to expirations of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2011 is net of a benefit of approximately $29,600 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Income tax expense for 2010 is net of a benefit of approximately $22,300 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. Absent these items and potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in 2012, 2011 and 2010, the effective tax rates would have been 27.0%, 26.2% and 25.4%, respectively. The increases in the adjusted tax rate from 2010 to 2011 and from 2011 to 2012 primarily reflect the change in the geographic mix of where the company earned its profits.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2012 the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program. During 2013, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. In the event that the Company is not able to issue commercial paper, the Company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2013, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although the Company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the Company.

As of December 30, 2012 the Companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $849,701, substantially all of which is held by international subsidiaries outside of the United States. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the Company. Accordingly, international cash balances are not available to fund cash requirements in the United States unless the Company changes its reinvestment policy. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the United States to fund cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. If the Company changes its policy of permanently reinvesting international earnings, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the United States and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries. If the Company repatriated the funds from its international subsidiaries, it would then be required to pay the additional U.S. income tax. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States as of December 30, 2012 is denominated in the U.S. dollar.  

At December 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $625,336 compared to $461,258 and $713,228 at December 25, 2011 and December 26, 2010, respectively. Hasbro generated $534,796, $396,069 and $367,981 of cash from its operating activities in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $59,277, $80,983 and $52,047, respectively, of cash used for television program production. Cash from operations in 2012, 2011 and 2010 also includes long-term royalty advance payments of $25,000 made to THE HUB in each of the three years.  

Accounts receivable, net decreased to $1,029,959 at December 30, 2012 from $1,034,580 at December 25, 2011. The accounts receivable balance at December 30, 2012 includes an increase of approximately $10,600 as a result of the translation of foreign currency. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts receivable, net decreased reflecting lower fourth quarter sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 72 days at December 30, 2012 from 70 days at December 25, 2011, primarily due to higher revenue volume in Latin America, a region which has longer payment terms. Accounts receivable, net increased to $1,034,580 at December 25, 2011 from $961,252 at December 26, 2010. The accounts receivable balance at December 25, 2011 included a decrease of approximately $24,900 as a result of the translation of foreign currency. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, the increase in accounts receivable reflected increased sales and timing of such sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Days sales outstanding increased to 70 days at December 25, 2011 from 68 days at December 26, 2010.  

Inventories decreased to $316,049 at December 30, 2012 compared to $333,993 at December 25, 2011. Inventories declined 23% in the U.S. and Canada segment, partially offset by increases in certain International markets including Russia, China and Korea. Inventories decreased to $333,993 at December 25, 2011 compared to $364,194 at December 26, 2010. The decreased inventory balance at December 25, 2011 reflects higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2010 as well as the Companys efforts to lower its overall levels from year-end 2010.  

Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $312,493 at December 30, 2012 from $243,431 at December 25, 2011. The balance at December 30, 2012 includes an increase of approximately $5,500 as a result of translation of foreign currency. Absent the impact of foreign currency translation, increases in prepaid royalties, primarily related to prepaid royalties previously recorded as long-term which have become current related to the MARVEL license, as well as deferred income taxes were partially offset by lower non-income based tax receivables compared to 2011 as a result of collections in 2012. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $243,431 at December 25, 2011 from $167,807 at December 26, 2010 primarily due to higher non-income based tax receivables. These tax receivables were primarily related to value added taxes in Europe that were due to the Company, primarily from France, Spain and Germany. The increase was primarily due to changes in the legal structure of the Companys European business, which resulted in larger outstanding balances at year-end 2011. This increase was partially offset by decreases in foreign exchange contracts and income tax receivables.  

Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $736,070 at December 30, 2012 from $761,914 at December 25, 2011. The 2012 balance includes an increase of approximately $8,300 as a result of the translation of foreign currency balances. The decrease was partially the result of lower accrued dividends as the result of a  

37  

Table of Contents 

 decision by the Companys Board to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in December 2012, which historically would have been paid in February 2013, to December 2012. In addition, the decrease relates to a decrease in accrued royalties as the result of lower sales of entertainment-based products as well as lower accrued non-income-based taxes. These lower balances were partially offset by severance costs accrued in the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as higher accrued payroll and management incentives. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $761,914 at December 25, 2011 compared $704,233 at December 26, 2010. The 2011 balance included a decrease of approximately $15,100 as a result of the translation of foreign currency balances. The increases in accrued expenses related to higher accrued royalties as a result of increased sales of royalty-bearing BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS products in 2011. The remainder of the increase related to higher accrued costs associated with cancelled purchase commitments and accrued income and other taxes. These increases were partially offset by lower accrued payroll and management incentives.  

Other liabilities increased to $461,152 at December 30, 2012 from $370,043 at December 25, 2011 and $361,324 at December 26, 2010. Increased non-current liabilities are primarily the result of higher pension liabilities at December 30, 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010. Further, other liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions increase in 2012 as compared to 2011.  

Cash flows utilized by investing activities were $106,172, $107,615 and $104,188 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which consisted primarily of additions to property, plant and equipment of approximately $112,100, $99,400 and $112,600 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Of these additions, 45% in 2012, 66% in 2011 and 57% in 2010 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2013, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $115,000 to $125,000. During the three years ended December 30, 2012, the depreciation of plant and equipment was $99,718, $113,821 and $95,925, respectively. Fluctuations in depreciation of plant and equipment correlate with the percentage of additions to property, plant and equipment relating to tools, dies and molds which have shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation. Cash utilized for investments and acquisitions was $11,585 in 2011. No investments and acquisitions were made in 2012 or 2010. The 2011 utilization represents the Companys purchase of intellectual property.  

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. During 2012 and 2011, the Company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit. In 2010, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and borrowings under its available lines of credit.  

During 2010, the Company was party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sold, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF was consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allowed HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it held to certain bank conduits. The program provided the Company with a source of working capital. In January 2011, the Company terminated this program.  

In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of banks to establish a commercial paper program (the Program). Under the Program, at the request of the Company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the Company, or arrange for the sale by the Company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. The Company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $500,000. The maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. Borrowings under the Program are supported by the Companys $700,000 revolving credit  

38  

Table of Contents 

 agreement. At December 30, 2012, the Company had notes outstanding with par value of approximately $209,200 related to the Program. In January 2013, the program was amended to increase the aggregate outstanding principal amount to $700,000.  

The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) as amended in October 2012 which provides the Company with a $700,000 committed borrowing facility through October of 2017. Previously, the Agreement provided the Company with a $500,000 committed borrowing facility through December of 2014. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2012. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 30, 2012. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of December 30, 2012 were approximately $1,100 and borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program were approximately $209,200. Amounts available and unused under the committed line, less outstanding balances under the commercial paper program, at December 30, 2012 were approximately $489,700. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $33,300 was utilized at December 30, 2012. Of the amount utilized under, or supported by, the uncommitted lines, approximately $15,100 and $18,200 represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.  

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $219,379 in 2012. Of this amount, $98,005 reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2012, the Company repurchased 2,694 shares at an average price of $37.11. At December 30, 2012, $127,282 remained under the May 2011 Board authorization. Dividends paid were $225,464 in 2012 compared to $154,028 in 2011 reflecting not only the increase in the Companys dividend rate in 2012 to $0.36 per quarter from $0.30 per quarter but also an additional dividend payment due to the decision by the Companys Board to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in December 2012, which historically would have been paid in February 2013, to December 2012. These utilizations were partially offset by net proceeds of $43,106 from short-term borrowings in 2012 as well as cash received from exercises of employee stock options of $54,963.  

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $375,685 in 2011. Of this amount, $423,008 reflected cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2011, the Company repurchased 10,461 shares at an average price of $40.42. Dividends paid were $154,028 in 2011 compared to $133,048 in 2010 reflecting the increase in the Companys dividend rate in 2011 to $0.30 per quarter from $0.25 per quarter. These utilizations were partially offset by net proceeds of $167,339 from short-term borrowings in 2011. In addition, cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2011 was $29,798.  

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $170,595 in 2010. Of this amount, $639,563 reflected cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the Companys common stock. During 2010, the Company repurchased 15,763 shares at an average price of $40.37. Dividends paid were $133,048 in 2010. These utilizations were partially offset by proceeds of $492,528 from the issuance of long-term notes in March 2010. In addition, cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2010 was $93,522.  

For the $425,000 in notes due in 2014 and the $350,000 in notes due in 2017 which bear interest at 6.125% and 6.30%, respectively, interest rates may be adjusted upward in the event that the Companys credit rating from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+, respectively, or below. At December 30, 2012, the Companys ratings from Moodys Investor Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB+ and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the Companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.  

Including the notes described above, the Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at December 30, 2012 of approximately $1,384,895 due at varying times from 2014 through 2040. The Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of $194,221 and purchase commitments of $262,101  

39  

Table of Contents 

 outstanding at December 30, 2012. Letters of credit and similar instruments include $174,870 of bonds related to the defense of tax assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $98,888 in 2013.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates  

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.  

Sales Allowances  

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.  

For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2012, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates made in prior years.  

Program Production Costs  

The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the Companys toy and game brands, including animated and live-action programs and game shows. These costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.  

The most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. Ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations. Ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy, game and other merchandise licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as DVD and digital distribution. Our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. We review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the  

40  

Table of Contents 

 quarter in which the estimates are revised. Prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. Factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the U.S. which are distributed on THE HUB and available on Netflix and iTunes, our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.  

For the year ended December 30, 2012 we have $91,975 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3-year period 2013 through 2015. Future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues. During 2012 the Company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs.  

Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows.  

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value. No reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test. Accordingly, no impairment was indicated. The Companys annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 30, 2012, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $550,663 recorded on the balance sheet.  

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $340,921 at December 30, 2012. During 2012, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.

Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments  

The Companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 30, 2012, the Company had $163,875 of prepaid royalties, $86,361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $77,514 of which are included in other assets.  

Pension Costs and Obligations  

Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. The estimates for the Companys U.S. plans are established at the Companys measurement date. The Company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.  

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2012 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 7.00%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2012 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $650.  

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Companys discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2012 pension expense averaged 4.96%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2012 pension expense by approximately $430.  

Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 30, 2012, the Companys U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $138,946 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $104,872 at December 25, 2011. The increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2012, primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at December 30, 2012, partially offset by the amount by which the Companys 2012 actual return on plan assets exceeded the expected return assumed in the calculation of the 2012 expense. The discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at December 30, 2012 decreased to 4.09% at December 30, 2012 from 4.96% used at December 25, 2011. A decrease of 0.25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased the 2012 projected benefit obligation by approximately $12,026. Pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.

Income Taxes  

The Companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  

An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the Companys interim results. In the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Companys interim results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the Companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2012 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During 2012, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately $8,300 associated with discrete tax events, primarily related to the repatriation of certain highly taxed foreign earnings as well as expirations of statutes in multiple jurisdictions.  

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Companys income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Companys income tax return. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the Company. In the event the Company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the United States and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries. At December 30, 2012, the difference between the tax rates in the United States and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately $393,000.  

The Mexican government has a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax. Should the Company be subject to the alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based tax in 2013, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense. At December 30, 2012, these deferred tax assets were approximately $7,300.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,384,895 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 30, 2012. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 30, 2012 are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 30, 2012, the Company has a liability, including potential interest and penalties, of $123,444 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.  

In connection with the Companys agreement to form a joint venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.  

The Companys agreement with Marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities. In connection with the extension of the Marvel license in 2009, the Company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling $140,000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next six years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases. Approximately $30,000 of these additional royalty guarantees are expected to be paid in 2013 based on the theatrical release of IRON MAN 3.  

Purchase commitments represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business. The reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2012.  

In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $5,800 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International pension plans in 2013. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $194,221 at December 30, 2012.  

The Company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations described above.  

Financial Risk Management  

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing  

44

 those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British Pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.  

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $61,622 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.  

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.  

The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 30, 2012, these contracts had net unrealized losses of $1,720, of which $1,729 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $12 are recorded in other assets, $(3,106) are recorded in accrued liabilities, and $(355) are recorded in other liabilities. Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December 30, 2012 are deferred losses of $1,008, net of tax, related to these derivatives.  

At December 30, 2012, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt, excluding adjustments, of $1,384,895. The Company was party to several interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $400,000, to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps were matched with specific long-term debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long-term debt. In November 2012, these interest rate swap agreements were terminated. The fair value was recorded as an adjustment to long-term debt and is now being amortized through the statement of operations over the life of the remaining long-term debt using a straight-line method. At December 30, 2012, this adjustment to long-term debt was $11,526. As a result of this termination long-term debt is no longer affected by variable interest rates and, thereby, earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates. The Company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately $31,000.  

The Economy and Inflation  

The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 42% of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 45% and 50% of its consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.  

The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2012, approximately 64% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. The Company expects that this concentration will continue. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing

 strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. Larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes Christmas.  

Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys future revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues.  

The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2012 was not significant and the Company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.  

Other Information  

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
